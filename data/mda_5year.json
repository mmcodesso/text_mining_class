OUR INNOVATIONS IN WEB SEARCH AND ADVERTISING\nHAVE MADE OUR WEBSITE A TOP INTERNET PROPERTY AND OUR BRAND ONE OF THE MOST RECOGNIZED IN THE WORLD. OUR MISSION IS TO ORGANIZE THE WORLD\u0092S INFORMATION AND MAKE IT UNIVERSALLY ACCESSIBLE AND USEFUL. WE SERVE THREE PRIMARY CONSTITUENCIES.\n\u0095\nUSERS.\nWE PROVIDE USERS WITH PRODUCTS AND SERVICES THAT ENABLE PEOPLE TO MORE QUICKLY AND EASILY FIND, CREATE, AND ORGANIZE INFORMATION THAT IS USEFUL TO\nTHEM.\n\u0095\nADVERTISERS.\nWE PROVIDE ADVERTISERS WITH COST-EFFECTIVE WAYS TO DELIVER ONLINE ADS, AS WELL AS OFFLINE ADS ON TELEVISION, TO CUSTOMERS ACROSS GOOGLE-OWNED\nWEBSITES AND THROUGH THE GOOGLE NETWORK, WHICH IS THE NETWORK OF THIRD PARTIES THAT USE OUR ADVERTISING PROGRAMS TO DELIVER RELEVANT ADS WITH THEIR SEARCH RESULTS AND CONTENT.\n\u0095\nGOOGLE NETWORK MEMBERS AND OTHER CONTENT PROVIDERS.\nWE PROVIDE THE MEMBERS OF OUR GOOGLE NETWORK WITH OUR GOOGLE ADSENSE PROGRAMS. THESE INCLUDE PROGRAMS\nTHROUGH WHICH WE DISTRIBUTE OUR ADVERTISERS\u0092 ADWORDS ADS FOR DISPLAY ON THE WEBSITES OF OUR GOOGLE NETWORK MEMBERS, AS WELL AS PROGRAMS TO DELIVER ADS ON TELEVISION BROADCASTS. WE SHARE MOST OF THE FEES THESE ADS GENERATE WITH OUR GOOGLE\nNETWORK MEMBERS, THEREBY CREATING AN IMPORTANT REVENUE STREAM FOR THEM. IN ADDITION, WE HAVE ENTERED INTO ARRANGEMENTS WITH OTHER CONTENT PROVIDERS UNDER WHICH WE DISTRIBUTE OR LICENSE THEIR VIDEO AND OTHER CONTENT, AND WE MAY DISPLAY ADS NEXT TO OR\nAS PART OF THIS CONTENT ON THE PAGES OF OUR WEBSITES AND OUR GOOGLE NETWORK MEMBERS\u0092 WEBSITES. WE SHARE MOST OF THE FEES THESE ADS GENERATE WITH THESE CONTENT PROVIDERS AND OUR GOOGLE NETWORK MEMBERS, THEREBY CREATING AN IMPORTANT REVENUE\nSTREAM FOR THESE PARTNERS.\nHOW WE GENERATE REVENUE\nADVERTISING REVENUES MADE UP 97% OF OUR REVENUES IN 2008 AND 2009, AND 96% OF OUR REVENUES IN 2010. WE DERIVE MOST OF OUR ADDITIONAL REVENUES FROM OFFERING DISPLAY ADVERTISING MANAGEMENT SERVICES TO ADVERTISERS, AD\nAGENCIES, AND PUBLISHERS, AS WELL AS LICENSING OUR ENTERPRISE PRODUCTS, SEARCH SOLUTIONS, AND WEB SEARCH TECHNOLOGY.\nGOOGLE ADWORDS IS\nOUR AUCTION-BASED ADVERTISING PROGRAM THAT ENABLES ADVERTISERS TO PLACE TEXT-BASED AND DISPLAY ADS ON OUR WEBSITES AND OUR GOOGLE NETWORK MEMBERS\u0092 WEBSITES. DISPLAY ADVERTISING COMPRISES THE VIDEOS, TEXT, IMAGES, AND OTHER INTERACTIVE ADS THAT\nRUN ACROSS THE WEB ON COMPUTERS AND MOBILE DEVICES, INCLUDING SMART PHONES AND HANDHELD COMPUTERS SUCH AS NETBOOKS AND TABLETS. MOST OF OUR ADWORDS CUSTOMERS PAY US ON A COST-PER-CLICK BASIS, WHICH MEANS THAT AN ADVERTISER PAYS US ONLY WHEN A\nUSER CLICKS ON ONE OF ITS ADS. WE ALSO OFFER ADWORDS ON A COST-PER-IMPRESSION BASIS THAT ENABLES ADVERTISERS TO PAY US BASED ON THE NUMBER OF TIMES THEIR ADS APPEAR ON OUR WEBSITES AND OUR GOOGLE NETWORK MEMBERS\u0092 WEBSITES AS SPECIFIED BY THE\nADVERTISER. FOR ADVERTISERS USING OUR ADWORDS COST-PER-CLICK PRICING, WE RECOGNIZE AS REVENUE THE FEES CHARGED TO ADVERTISERS EACH TIME A USER CLICKS ON ONE OF THE ADS THAT APPEARS NEXT TO THE SEARCH RESULTS OR CONTENT ON OUR WEBSITES OR OUR GOOGLE\nNETWORK MEMBERS\u0092 WEBSITES. FOR ADVERTISERS USING OUR ADWORDS COST-PER-IMPRESSION PRICING, WE RECOGNIZE AS REVENUE THE FEES CHARGED TO ADVERTISERS EACH TIME THEIR ADS ARE DISPLAYED ON OUR WEBSITES OR OUR GOOGLE NETWORK MEMBERS\u0092 WEBSITES.\nOUR ADWORDS AGREEMENTS ARE GENERALLY TERMINABLE AT ANY TIME BY OUR ADVERTISERS.\n25\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nGOOGLE ADSENSE REFERS TO THE ONLINE PROGRAMS THROUGH WHICH WE DISTRIBUTE OUR ADVERTISERS\u0092\nADWORDS ADS FOR DISPLAY ON THE WEBSITES OF OUR GOOGLE NETWORK MEMBERS, AS WELL AS PROGRAMS TO DELIVER ADS ON TELEVISION. OUR ADSENSE PROGRAMS INCLUDE ADSENSE FOR SEARCH AND ADSENSE FOR CONTENT.\nADSENSE FOR SEARCH IS OUR ONLINE SERVICE FOR DISTRIBUTING RELEVANT ADS FROM OUR ADVERTISERS FOR DISPLAY WITH SEARCH RESULTS ON OUR GOOGLE NETWORK\nMEMBERS\u0092 WEBSITES. TO USE ADSENSE FOR SEARCH, MOST OF OUR ADSENSE FOR SEARCH PARTNERS ADD GOOGLE SEARCH FUNCTIONALITY TO THEIR WEB PAGES IN THE FORM OF CUSTOMIZABLE GOOGLE SEARCH BOXES. WHEN VISITORS OF THESE WEBSITES SEARCH EITHER THE WEBSITE\nOR THE INTERNET USING THESE CUSTOMIZABLE SEARCH BOXES, WE DISPLAY RELEVANT ADS ON THE SEARCH RESULTS PAGES, TARGETED TO MATCH USER SEARCH QUERIES. ADS SHOWN THROUGH ADSENSE FOR SEARCH ARE TEXT ADS.\nADSENSE FOR CONTENT IS OUR ONLINE SERVICE FOR DISTRIBUTING ADS FROM OUR ADVERTISERS THAT ARE RELEVANT TO CONTENT ON OUR GOOGLE NETWORK\nMEMBERS\u0092 WEBSITES. UNDER THIS PROGRAM, WE USE AUTOMATED TECHNOLOGY TO ANALYZE THE MEANING OF THE CONTENT ON THE WEB PAGE AND SERVE RELEVANT ADS BASED ON THE MEANING OF SUCH CONTENT. FOR EXAMPLE, A WEB PAGE ON AN AUTOMOTIVE BLOG THAT CONTAINS AN\nENTRY ABOUT VINTAGE CARS MIGHT DISPLAY ADS FOR VINTAGE CAR PARTS OR VINTAGE CAR SHOWS. THESE ADS ARE DISPLAYED IN SPACES THAT OUR ADSENSE FOR CONTENT PARTNERS HAVE SET ASIDE ON THEIR WEBSITES. ADSENSE FOR CONTENT ALLOWS A VARIETY OF AD TYPES TO BE\nSHOWN, INCLUDING TEXT ADS, IMAGE ADS, GOOGLE VIDEO ADS, LINK UNITS (WHICH ARE SETS OF CLICKABLE LINKS TO TOPIC PAGES RELATED TO PAGE CONTENT), THEMED UNITS (WHICH ARE REGULAR TEXT ADS WITH GRAPHIC TREATMENTS THAT CHANGE SEASONALLY AND BY GEOGRAPHY),\nAND GADGET ADS (WHICH ARE CUSTOMIZED \u0093MINI-SITES\u0094 THAT RUN AS ADS ON ADSENSE PUBLISHER WEBSITES).\nFOR OUR ONLINE ADSENSE\nPROGRAM, OUR ADVERTISERS PAY US A FEE EACH TIME A USER CLICKS ON ONE OF OUR ADVERTISERS\u0092 ADS DISPLAYED ON OUR GOOGLE NETWORK MEMBERS\u0092 WEBSITES OR, FOR THOSE ADVERTISERS WHO CHOOSE OUR COST-PER-IMPRESSION PRICING, AS THEIR ADS ARE\nDISPLAYED. TO DATE, WE HAVE PAID MOST OF THESE ADVERTISER FEES TO OUR GOOGLE NETWORK MEMBERS, AND WE EXPECT TO CONTINUE DOING SO FOR THE FORESEEABLE FUTURE. WE RECOGNIZE THESE ADVERTISER FEES AS REVENUE AND THE PORTION OF THE ADVERTISER FEE WE PAY\nTO OUR GOOGLE NETWORK MEMBERS AS TRAFFIC ACQUISITION COSTS UNDER COST OF REVENUES. GOOGLE NETWORK MEMBERS DO NOT PAY ANY FEES ASSOCIATED WITH THE USE OF OUR ADSENSE PROGRAM ON THEIR WEBSITES.\nOUR AGREEMENTS WITH GOOGLE NETWORK MEMBERS CONSIST LARGELY OF UNIFORM ONLINE \u0093CLICK-WRAP\u0094 AGREEMENTS THAT MEMBERS ENTER INTO BY\nINTERACTING WITH OUR REGISTRATION WEBSITES. THE STANDARD AGREEMENTS HAVE NO STATED TERM AND ARE TERMINABLE AT WILL. AGREEMENTS WITH OUR LARGER MEMBERS ARE INDIVIDUALLY NEGOTIATED. BOTH THE STANDARD AGREEMENTS AND THE NEGOTIATED AGREEMENTS REQUIRE US\nTO SHARE WITH THE GOOGLE NETWORK MEMBER MOST OF THE ADVERTISER FEES GENERATED BY USERS CLICKING ON ADS ON THE GOOGLE NETWORK MEMBER\u0092S WEBSITE OR, FOR ADVERTISERS WHO CHOOSE OUR COST-PER-IMPRESSION PRICING, AS THE ADS ARE DISPLAYED ON THE GOOGLE\nNETWORK MEMBER\u0092S WEBSITE. FOR EXAMPLE, UNDER OUR STANDARD AGREEMENTS, WE PAY 51% AND 68% OF THE FEES COLLECTED FROM ADVERTISERS TO OUR GOOGLE NETWORK MEMBERS IN ADSENSE FOR SEARCH AND ADSENSE FOR CONTENT, RESPECTIVELY.\nGOOGLE ADS FOR TELEVISIONS ENABLE ADVERTISERS, OPERATORS, AND PROGRAMMERS TO BUY, SCHEDULE, DELIVER, AND MEASURE ADS ON TELEVISION. WE RECOGNIZE AS\nREVENUE THE FEES CHARGED TO ADVERTISERS EACH TIME AN AD IS DISPLAYED ON TELEVISION IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE RELATED AGREEMENTS.\nWE ALSO\nOFFER DISPLAY ADVERTISING MANAGEMENT SERVICES SUCH AS MEDIA PLANNING, BUYING, IMPLEMENTATION, AND MEASUREMENT TOOLS FOR ADVERTISERS AND AGENCIES, AND FORECASTING AND REPORTING TOOLS FOR PUBLISHERS. WE RECOGNIZE THE RELATED FEES AS OTHER REVENUES IN\nTHE PERIOD ADVERTISING IMPRESSIONS ARE DELIVERED.\nIN JANUARY 2010, WE LAUNCHED, AND IN JULY 2010, WE DISCONTINUED, OUR\nDIRECT-TO-CONSUMER WEB STORE CHANNEL OF DISTRIBUTING OUR NEXUS ONE MOBILE PHONE. WE HAD RECOGNIZED FEES DERIVED FROM THE SALE OF THESE PHONES AS OTHER REVENUES IN THE PERIOD IN WHICH THEY WERE DELIVERED. WE DO NOT EXPECT TO RECOGNIZE ANY ADDITIONAL\nREVENUE ASSOCIATED WITH THE SALE OF THESE PHONES IN THE FUTURE.\n26\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nWE HAVE ENTERED INTO ARRANGEMENTS WITH CERTAIN CONTENT PROVIDERS UNDER WHICH WE DISTRIBUTE OR LICENSE\nTHEIR VIDEO AND OTHER CONTENT. OUR AGREEMENTS WITH CONTENT PROVIDERS ARE TYPICALLY STANDARD AGREEMENTS WITH NO STATED TERM AND ARE TERMINABLE AT WILL. AGREEMENTS WITH OUR LARGER MEMBERS ARE INDIVIDUALLY NEGOTIATED. BOTH THE STANDARD AGREEMENTS AND\nTHE NEGOTIATED AGREEMENTS REQUIRE US TO PAY THE CONTENT PROVIDERS FOR THE CONTENT WE LICENSE. IN A NUMBER OF THESE ARRANGEMENTS, WE DISPLAY ADS ON THE PAGES OF OUR WEBSITES AND OUR GOOGLE NETWORK MEMBERS\u0092 WEBSITES FROM WHICH THE CONTENT IS\nVIEWED AND SHARE MOST OF THE FEES THESE ADS GENERATE WITH THE CONTENT PROVIDERS AND GOOGLE NETWORK MEMBERS. WE RECOGNIZE THESE ADVERTISER FEES AS REVENUE. WE RECOGNIZE THE PORTION OF THE ADVERTISER FEES WE PAY TO OUR CONTENT PROVIDERS AS CONTENT\nACQUISITION COSTS UNDER COST OF REVENUES AND THE PORTION WE PAY TO OUR GOOGLE NETWORK MEMBERS AS TRAFFIC ACQUISITION COSTS.\nWE BELIEVE\nTHE FACTORS THAT INFLUENCE THE SUCCESS OF OUR ADVERTISING PROGRAMS INCLUDE THE FOLLOWING.\n\u0095\nTHE RELEVANCE, OBJECTIVITY, AND QUALITY OF OUR SEARCH RESULTS AND THE RELEVANCE AND QUALITY OF ADS DISPLAYED WITH EACH SEARCH RESULTS PAGE.\n\u0095\nTHE NUMBER OF SEARCHES INITIATED AT OUR WEBSITES AND OUR GOOGLE NETWORK MEMBERS\u0092 WEBSITES AND THE UNDERLYING PURPOSE OF THESE SEARCHES (FOR INSTANCE,\nWHETHER THEY ARE FOR ACADEMIC RESEARCH, TO FIND A NEWS ARTICLE, OR TO FIND A PRODUCT OR SERVICE).\n\u0095\nTHE NUMBER AND PROMINENCE OF ADS DISPLAYED ON OUR WEBSITES AND OUR GOOGLE NETWORK MEMBERS\u0092 WEBSITES.\n\u0095\nTHE NUMBER OF VISITS TO, AND THE CONTENT OF, OUR GOOGLE NETWORK MEMBERS\u0092 WEBSITES AND CERTAIN OF OUR WEBSITES AND THE RELEVANCE AND QUALITY OF THE ADS WE\nDISPLAY NEXT TO THIS CONTENT.\n\u0095\nTHE ADVERTISERS\u0092 RETURN ON INVESTMENT FROM ADVERTISING CAMPAIGNS ON OUR WEBSITES OR OUR GOOGLE NETWORK MEMBERS\u0092 WEBSITES COMPARED TO OTHER FORMS OF\nADVERTISING.\n\u0095\nTHE TOTAL ADVERTISING SPENDING BUDGETS OF EACH ADVERTISER.\n\u0095\nTHE NUMBER OF ADVERTISERS AND THE BREADTH OF ITEMS ADVERTISED.\n\u0095\nTHE AMOUNT WE ULTIMATELY PAY OUR GOOGLE NETWORK MEMBERS, DISTRIBUTION PARTNERS, AND OUR CONTENT PROVIDERS FOR TRAFFIC, ACCESS POINTS, AND CONTENT, COMPARED TO\nTHE AMOUNT OF REVENUES WE GENERATE.\n\u0095\nOUR ABILITY TO INCREASE SEARCHES ON OUR WEBSITES AND OUR GOOGLE NETWORK MEMBERS\u0092 WEBSITES VIA NEW AD FORMATS ON DEVICES OTHER THAN PERSONAL COMPUTERS,\nINCLUDING MOBILE DEVICES.\nTRENDS IN OUR BUSINESS\nADVERTISING TRANSACTIONS CONTINUE TO SHIFT FROM OFFLINE TO ONLINE AS THE DIGITAL ECONOMY EVOLVES. THIS HAS CONTRIBUTED TO THE RAPID GROWTH OF OUR BUSINESS SINCE INCEPTION, RESULTING IN SUBSTANTIALLY INCREASED\nREVENUES, AND WE EXPECT THAT OUR BUSINESS WILL CONTINUE TO GROW. HOWEVER, OUR REVENUE GROWTH RATE HAS GENERALLY DECLINED OVER TIME, AND WE EXPECT IT WILL CONTINUE TO DO SO AS A RESULT OF A NUMBER OF FACTORS, INCLUDING INCREASING COMPETITION, THE\nDIFFICULTY OF MAINTAINING GROWTH RATES AS OUR REVENUES INCREASE TO HIGHER LEVELS, AND INCREASING MATURITY OF THE ONLINE ADVERTISING MARKET. IN ADDITION, WE PLAN TO CONTINUE TO INVEST AGGRESSIVELY IN OUR CORE AREAS OF STRATEGIC FOCUS.\nTHE MAIN FOCUS OF OUR ADVERTISING PROGRAMS IS TO PROVIDE RELEVANT AND USEFUL ADVERTISING TO OUR USERS, REFLECTING OUR COMMITMENT TO CONSTANTLY\nIMPROVE THEIR OVERALL WEB EXPERIENCE. AS A RESULT, WE EXPECT TO CONTINUE TO TAKE STEPS TO IMPROVE THE RELEVANCE OF THE ADS DISPLAYED ON OUR WEBSITES AND OUR GOOGLE NETWORK MEMBERS\u0092 WEBSITES. THESE STEPS INCLUDE NOT DISPLAYING ADS THAT GENERATE\nLOW CLICK-THROUGH RATES OR THAT SEND USERS TO IRRELEVANT OR OTHERWISE LOW QUALITY WEBSITES, AND TERMINATING OUR RELATIONSHIPS WITH THOSE GOOGLE NETWORK MEMBERS WHOSE WEBSITES DO NOT MEET OUR QUALITY REQUIREMENTS. WE MAY ALSO CONTINUE TO TAKE STEPS\nTO REDUCE THE NUMBER OF ACCIDENTAL CLICKS BY OUR USERS. THESE STEPS COULD NEGATIVELY AFFECT THE GROWTH RATE OF OUR REVENUES.\n27\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nBOTH SEASONAL FLUCTUATIONS IN INTERNET USAGE AND TRADITIONAL RETAIL SEASONALITY HAVE AFFECTED, AND\nARE LIKELY TO CONTINUE TO AFFECT, OUR BUSINESS. INTERNET USAGE GENERALLY SLOWS DURING THE SUMMER MONTHS, AND COMMERCIAL QUERIES TYPICALLY INCREASE SIGNIFICANTLY IN THE FOURTH QUARTER OF EACH YEAR. THESE SEASONAL TRENDS HAVE CAUSED, AND WILL LIKELY\nCONTINUE TO CAUSE, FLUCTUATIONS IN OUR QUARTERLY RESULTS, INCLUDING FLUCTUATIONS IN SEQUENTIAL REVENUES, AS WELL AS AGGREGATE PAID CLICK AND AVERAGE COST-PER-CLICK GROWTH RATES.\nTHE OPERATING MARGIN WE REALIZE ON REVENUES GENERATED FROM ADS PLACED ON OUR GOOGLE NETWORK MEMBERS\u0092 WEBSITES THROUGH OUR ADSENSE PROGRAM IS\nSIGNIFICANTLY LOWER THAN THE OPERATING MARGIN WE REALIZE FROM REVENUES GENERATED FROM ADS PLACED ON OUR WEBSITES BECAUSE MOST OF THE ADVERTISER FEES FROM ADS SERVED ON GOOGLE NETWORK MEMBERS\u0092 WEBSITES ARE SHARED WITH OUR GOOGLE NETWORK MEMBERS.\nFOR THE PAST FIVE YEARS, GROWTH IN ADVERTISING REVENUES FROM OUR WEBSITES HAS GENERALLY EXCEEDED THAT FROM OUR GOOGLE NETWORK MEMBERS\u0092 WEBSITES. THIS TREND HAS HAD A POSITIVE IMPACT ON OUR OPERATING MARGINS, AND WE EXPECT THAT THIS WILL\nCONTINUE FOR THE FORESEEABLE FUTURE, ALTHOUGH THE RELATIVE RATE OF GROWTH IN REVENUES FROM OUR WEBSITES COMPARED TO THE RATE OF GROWTH IN REVENUES FROM OUR GOOGLE NETWORK MEMBERS\u0092 WEBSITES MAY VARY OVER TIME.\nWE ALSO CONTINUE TO INVEST AGGRESSIVELY IN OUR SYSTEMS, DATA CENTERS, CORPORATE FACILITIES, INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY INFRASTRUCTURE, AND EMPLOYEES.\nWE EXPECT TO INCREASE OUR HIRING IN 2011 AND PROVIDE COMPETITIVE COMPENSATION PROGRAMS FOR OUR EMPLOYEES. FOR INSTANCE, EFFECTIVE JANUARY 1, 2011, WE INCREASED BASE SALARIES FOR ALL OF OUR NON-EXECUTIVE EMPLOYEES BY 10%, AS WELL AS SHIFTED A\nPORTION OF THE BONUS INTO BASE SALARY. OUR FULL-TIME EMPLOYEE HEADCOUNT WAS 19,835 AT DECEMBER 31, 2009 AND 24,400 AT DECEMBER 31, 2010. ACQUISITIONS WILL ALSO REMAIN AN IMPORTANT COMPONENT OF OUR STRATEGY AND USE OF CAPITAL, AND WE EXPECT\nOUR CURRENT PACE OF ACQUISITIONS TO CONTINUE. WE EXPECT OUR COST OF REVENUES WILL INCREASE IN DOLLARS AND MAY INCREASE AS A PERCENTAGE OF REVENUES IN FUTURE PERIODS, PRIMARILY AS A RESULT OF FORECASTED INCREASES IN TRAFFIC ACQUISITION COSTS,\nDATA CENTER COSTS, CREDIT CARD AND OTHER TRANSACTION FEES, CONTENT ACQUISITION COSTS, AND OTHER COSTS. IN PARTICULAR, TRAFFIC ACQUISITION COSTS AS A PERCENTAGE OF ADVERTISING REVENUES MAY INCREASE IN THE FUTURE IF WE ARE UNABLE TO CONTINUE TO\nIMPROVE THE MONETIZATION OR GENERATION OF REVENUES FROM TRAFFIC ON OUR WEBSITES AND OUR GOOGLE NETWORK MEMBERS\u0092 WEBSITES.\nAS WE\nEXPAND OUR ADVERTISING PROGRAMS AND OTHER PRODUCTS TO INTERNATIONAL MARKETS, WE CONTINUE TO INCREASE OUR EXPOSURE TO FLUCTUATIONS IN FOREIGN CURRENCY TO U.S. DOLLAR EXCHANGE RATES. FOR EXAMPLE, IN 2010, THE GENERAL STRENGTHENING OF THE U.S. DOLLAR\nRELATIVE TO FOREIGN CURRENCIES (PRIMARILY THE EURO) HAD AN UNFAVORABLE IMPACT ON OUR REVENUES AS COMPARED TO 2009. WE HAVE A FOREIGN EXCHANGE RISK MANAGEMENT PROGRAM THAT IS DESIGNED TO REDUCE OUR EXPOSURE TO FLUCTUATIONS IN FOREIGN CURRENCY\nEXCHANGE RATES. HOWEVER, THIS PROGRAM WILL NOT FULLY OFFSET THE EFFECT OF FLUCTUATIONS ON OUR REVENUES AND EARNINGS.\n28\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nRESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nTHE FOLLOWING TABLE PRESENTS OUR HISTORICAL OPERATING RESULTS AS A PERCENTAGE OF REVENUES FOR THE PERIODS INDICATED.\nYEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31,\n2008\n2009\n2010\nCONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF INCOME DATA.\nREVENUES\n100.0%\n100.0%\n100.0%\nCOSTS AND EXPENSES.\nCOST OF REVENUES\n39.6\n37.4\n35.5\nRESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT\n12.8\n12.0\n12.8\nSALES AND MARKETING\n8.9\n8.4\n9.5\nGENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE\n8.3\n7.0\n6.8\nTOTAL COSTS AND EXPENSES\n69.6\n64.8\n64.6\nINCOME FROM OPERATIONS\n30.4\n35.2\n35.4\nIMPAIRMENT OF EQUITY INVESTMENTS\n(5.0\n)\n0\n0\nINTEREST AND OTHER INCOME, NET\n1.5\n0.3\n1.4\nINCOME BEFORE INCOME TAXES\n26.9\n35.5\n36.8\nPROVISION FOR INCOME TAXES\n7.5\n7.9\n7.8\nNET INCOME\n19.4%\n27.6%\n29.0%\nREVENUES\nTHE\nFOLLOWING TABLE PRESENTS OUR REVENUES, BY REVENUE SOURCE, FOR THE PERIODS PRESENTED (IN MILLIONS).\nYEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31,\n2008\n2009\n2010\nADVERTISING REVENUES.\nGOOGLE WEBSITES\n$14,414\n$15,723\n$19,444\nGOOGLE NETWORK WEBSITES\n6,715\n7,166\n8,792\nTOTAL ADVERTISING REVENUES\n21,129\n22,889\n28,236\nOTHER REVENUES\n667\n762\n1,085\nREVENUES\n$21,796\n$23,651\n$29,321\nTHE FOLLOWING TABLE PRESENTS OUR REVENUES, BY REVENUE SOURCE, AS A PERCENTAGE OF TOTAL REVENUES FOR THE PERIODS\nPRESENTED.\nYEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31,\n2008\n2009\n2010\nADVERTISING REVENUES.\nGOOGLE WEBSITES\n66%\n67%\n66%\nGOOGLE NETWORK WEBSITES\n31\n30\n30\nTOTAL ADVERTISING REVENUES\n97\n97\n96\nGOOGLE WEBSITES AS % OF ADVERTISING REVENUES\n68\n69\n69\nGOOGLE NETWORK WEBSITES AS % OF ADVERTISING REVENUES\n32\n31\n31\nOTHER REVENUES\n3%\n3%\n4%\nTHE INCREASE IN OUR REVENUES FROM 2009 TO 2010\nRESULTED PRIMARILY FROM AN INCREASE IN ADVERTISING REVENUES GENERATED BY GOOGLE WEBSITES AND GOOGLE NETWORK MEMBERS\u0092 WEBSITES AND, TO A LESSER EXTENT, AN INCREASE IN OTHER\n29\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nREVENUES, LARGELY AS A RESULT OF THE LAUNCH OF OUR MOBILE PHONE BUSINESS IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2010. THE INCREASE IN ADVERTISING REVENUE FOR GOOGLE WEBSITES AND GOOGLE NETWORK MEMBERS\u0092\nWEBSITES FROM 2009 TO 2010 RESULTED PRIMARILY FROM AN INCREASE IN THE NUMBER OF PAID CLICKS THROUGH OUR ADVERTISING PROGRAMS AND, TO A LESSER EXTENT, AN INCREASE IN THE AVERAGE COST-PER-CLICK PAID BY OUR ADVERTISERS. THE INCREASE IN THE NUMBER OF\nPAID CLICKS GENERATED THROUGH OUR ADVERTISING PROGRAMS WAS DUE TO AN INCREASE IN AGGREGATE TRAFFIC, CERTAIN MONETIZATION IMPROVEMENTS, INCLUDING NEW AD FORMATS, AND THE CONTINUED GLOBAL EXPANSION OF OUR PRODUCTS, AND OUR ADVERTISER AND USER BASE, AS\nWELL AS AN INCREASE IN THE NUMBER OF GOOGLE NETWORK MEMBERS. THE INCREASE IN THE AVERAGE COST-PER-CLICK PAID BY OUR ADVERTISERS WAS PRIMARILY DRIVEN BY THE INCREASED SPENDING FROM ADVERTISERS, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY THE CHANGES IN GEOGRAPHICAL MIX DUE\nTO TRAFFIC GROWTH IN EMERGING MARKETS, WHERE THE AVERAGE COST-PER-CLICK IS TYPICALLY LOWER, COMPARED TO MORE MATURE MARKETS.\nGROWTH IN\nOUR REVENUES FROM 2008 TO 2009 RESULTED PRIMARILY FROM GROWTH IN ADVERTISING REVENUES GENERATED BY GOOGLE WEBSITES, AND TO A LESSER EXTENT, GOOGLE NETWORK MEMBERS\u0092 WEBSITES. OUR ADVERTISING REVENUE GROWTH FOR GOOGLE WEBSITES AND GOOGLE NETWORK\nMEMBERS\u0092 WEBSITES RESULTED PRIMARILY FROM AN INCREASE IN THE NUMBER OF PAID CLICKS THROUGH OUR ADVERTISING PROGRAMS, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY A DECREASE IN THE AVERAGE COST-PER-CLICK PAID BY OUR ADVERTISERS. IN ADDITION, THE GROWTH IN ADVERTISING\nREVENUES BENEFITED FROM MORE HEDGING GAINS RECOGNIZED UNDER OUR FOREIGN EXCHANGE RISK MANAGEMENT PROGRAM. THE INCREASE IN THE NUMBER OF PAID CLICKS GENERATED THROUGH OUR ADVERTISING PROGRAMS WAS DUE TO AN INCREASE IN AGGREGATE TRAFFIC, CERTAIN\nMONETIZATION IMPROVEMENTS, AND THE CONTINUED GLOBAL EXPANSION OF OUR PRODUCTS, ADVERTISER BASE, AND USER BASE, AS WELL AS AN INCREASE IN THE NUMBER OF GOOGLE NETWORK MEMBERS. THE DECREASE IN THE AVERAGE COST-PER-CLICK PAID BY OUR ADVERTISERS WAS\nPRIMARILY THE RESULT OF THE GENERAL STRENGTHENING OF THE U.S. DOLLAR RELATIVE TO FOREIGN CURRENCIES (PRINCIPALLY THE BRITISH POUND AND THE EURO), AS WELL AS CHANGES IN GEOGRAPHICAL MIX DUE TO TRAFFIC GROWTH IN EMERGING MARKETS, WHERE THE AVERAGE\nCOST-PER-CLICK IS TYPICALLY LOWER, COMPARED TO MORE MATURE MARKETS. IN ADDITION, THE DECREASE IN THE AVERAGE COST-PER-CLICK WAS DUE TO CHANGES IN HOW WE BELIEVE ADVERTISERS MANAGED THEIR ADVERTISING COSTS IN RESPONSE TO THE UNCERTAIN ECONOMIC\nCONDITIONS IN 2008 AND 2009. SPECIFICALLY, WE BELIEVE THAT, AS A RESULT OF THE ECONOMIC DOWNTURN AND THE ECONOMIC UNCERTAINTY, ADVERTISERS, IN AGGREGATE, LOWERED THEIR BIDS FOR KEYWORDS IN RESPONSE TO A DECREASE IN SALES THEY WERE ABLE TO MAKE PER\nPAID CLICK.\nIMPROVEMENTS IN OUR ABILITY TO ULTIMATELY MONETIZE INCREASED TRAFFIC PRIMARILY RELATE TO ENHANCING THE USER EXPERIENCE,\nINCLUDING MOVING THE SEARCH RESULT URL (UNIFORM RESOURCE LOCATOR) TO A SEPARATE LINE TO IMPROVE USERS\u0092 READABILITY, PROVIDING USERS WITH ADS THAT ARE MORE RELEVANT TO THEIR SEARCH QUERIES OR TO THE CONTENT ON THE GOOGLE NETWORK MEMBERS\u0092\nWEBSITES THEY VISIT. FOR INSTANCE, THESE IMPROVEMENTS INCLUDE ENABLING PREVIOUSLY PROMOTED HIGH QUALITY ADS TO BE SHOWN ON SUBSEQUENT PAGES, ADDING MERCHANT RATINGS INFORMATION TO IMPROVE USERS\u0092 ABILITY TO EVALUATE ADS, PROVIDING USERS WITH\nMULTIPLE AD SITE LINKS FOR CERTAIN WEB SEARCH AD RESULTS, REDUCING THE MINIMUM COST-PER-CLICK WHICH RESULTS IN THE DISPLAY OF MORE RELEVANT ADS, AND CHANGING THE CLICKABLE AREA AROUND OUR ADSENSE FOR CONTENT TEXT-BASED ADS TO ONLY THE TITLE AND URL\nTO REDUCE THE NUMBER OF ACCIDENTAL CLICKS.\nAGGREGATE PAID CLICKS ON GOOGLE WEBSITES AND GOOGLE NETWORK MEMBERS\u0092 WEBSITES INCREASED\nAPPROXIMATELY 16% FROM 2009 TO 2010 AND APPROXIMATELY 15% FROM 2008 TO 2009. AVERAGE COST-PER-CLICK ON GOOGLE WEBSITES AND GOOGLE NETWORK MEMBERS\u0092 WEBSITES INCREASED APPROXIMATELY 5% FROM 2009 TO 2010 AND DECREASED APPROXIMATELY 7% FROM 2008 TO\n2009. THE RATE OF CHANGE IN AGGREGATE PAID CLICKS AND AVERAGE COST-PER-CLICK, AND THEIR CORRELATION WITH THE RATE OF CHANGE IN REVENUES, HAS FLUCTUATED AND MAY FLUCTUATE IN THE FUTURE BECAUSE OF VARIOUS FACTORS INCLUDING THE REVENUE GROWTH RATES ON\nOUR WEBSITES COMPARED TO THOSE OF OUR GOOGLE NETWORK MEMBERS, ADVERTISER COMPETITION FOR KEYWORDS, CHANGES IN FOREIGN CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATES, SEASONALITY, THE FEES ADVERTISERS ARE WILLING TO PAY BASED ON HOW THEY MANAGE THEIR ADVERTISING COSTS, AND\nGENERAL ECONOMIC CONDITIONS. IN ADDITION, TRAFFIC GROWTH IN EMERGING MARKETS COMPARED TO MORE MATURE MARKETS AND ACROSS VARIOUS ADVERTISING VERTICALS ALSO CONTRIBUTES TO THESE FLUCTUATIONS. CHANGES IN AGGREGATE PAID CLICKS AND AVERAGE COST-PER-CLICK\nMAY NOT BE INDICATIVE OF OUR PERFORMANCE OR ADVERTISER EXPERIENCES IN ANY SPECIFIC GEOGRAPHIC MARKET, VERTICAL, OR INDUSTRY.\nWE BELIEVE\nTHAT THE INCREASE IN THE NUMBER OF PAID CLICKS ON GOOGLE WEBSITES AND GOOGLE NETWORK MEMBERS\u0092 WEBSITES IS SUBSTANTIALLY THE RESULT OF OUR COMMITMENT TO IMPROVING THE RELEVANCE AND QUALITY OF BOTH OUR SEARCH\n30\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nRESULTS AND THE ADVERTISEMENTS DISPLAYED, WHICH WE BELIEVE RESULTS IN A BETTER USER EXPERIENCE, WHICH IN TURN RESULTS IN MORE SEARCHES, ADVERTISERS, AND GOOGLE NETWORK MEMBERS AND OTHER PARTNERS.\nREVENUES BY GEOGRAPHY\nTHE FOLLOWING\nTABLE PRESENTS OUR DOMESTIC AND INTERNATIONAL REVENUES AS A PERCENTAGE OF CONSOLIDATED REVENUES, DETERMINED BASED ON THE BILLING ADDRESSES OF OUR CUSTOMERS.\nYEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31,\n2008\n2009\n2010\nUNITED STATES\n49%\n47%\n48%\nUNITED KINGDOM\n14%\n13%\n11%\nREST OF THE WORLD\n37%\n40%\n41%\nTHE GROWTH IN INTERNATIONAL REVENUES (OTHER\nTHAN THE UNITED KINGDOM) AS A PERCENTAGE OF CONSOLIDATED REVENUES FROM 2009 TO 2010 RESULTED LARGELY FROM INCREASED ACCEPTANCE OF OUR ADVERTISING PROGRAMS AND OUR CONTINUED PROGRESS IN DEVELOPING LOCALIZED VERSIONS OF OUR PRODUCTS FOR THESE\nINTERNATIONAL MARKETS. THE GROWTH IN REVENUES FROM THE UNITED STATES AS A PERCENTAGE OF CONSOLIDATED REVENUES FROM 2009 TO 2010 RESULTED LARGELY FROM THE RECOVERY OF CERTAIN KEY VERTICALS SUCH AS RETAIL, TRAVEL, FINANCE, AND INSURANCE. THE DECLINE\nIN REVENUES FROM THE UNITED KINGDOM AS A PERCENTAGE OF CONSOLIDATED REVENUES FROM 2009 TO 2010 RESULTED PRIMARILY FROM A LESS ROBUST ECONOMIC RECOVERY RELATIVE TO THE UNITED STATES AND THE REST OF WORLD, AS WELL AS A DECREASE IN HEDGING GAINS\nRECOGNIZED DURING 2010.\nTHE GROWTH IN INTERNATIONAL REVENUES (OTHER THAN THE UNITED KINGDOM) AS A PERCENTAGE OF CONSOLIDATED REVENUES\nFROM 2008 TO 2009 RESULTED LARGELY FROM INCREASED ACCEPTANCE OF OUR ADVERTISING PROGRAMS AND OUR CONTINUED PROGRESS IN DEVELOPING LOCALIZED VERSIONS OF OUR PRODUCTS FOR THESE INTERNATIONAL MARKETS, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY THE NET EFFECT OF THE GENERAL\nSTRENGTHENING OF THE U.S. DOLLAR COMPARED TO FOREIGN CURRENCIES (PRIMARILY THE EURO) AND THE RELATED HEDGING GAINS. THE DECREASE IN REVENUES FROM THE UNITED KINGDOM AS A PERCENTAGE OF CONSOLIDATED REVENUES FROM 2008 TO 2009 RESULTED LARGELY FROM THE\nEFFECT OF THE GENERAL STRENGTHENING OF THE U.S. DOLLAR COMPARED TO THE BRITISH POUND, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY MORE HEDGING GAINS REALIZED FROM OUR FOREIGN EXCHANGE RISK MANAGEMENT PROGRAM IN 2009 AS COMPARED TO 2008.\nTHE GENERAL STRENGTHENING OF THE U.S. DOLLAR RELATIVE TO CERTAIN FOREIGN CURRENCIES (PRIMARILY THE EURO) FROM 2009 TO 2010 HAD AN UNFAVORABLE\nIMPACT ON OUR INTERNATIONAL REVENUES.

THIS IS BEFORE CONSIDERATION OF HEDGING GAINS OF $182 MILLION AND $143 MILLION RECOGNIZED TO REVENUES FROM THE UNITED KINGDOM AND THE REST OF THE WORLD IN 2009.\nALTHOUGH WE EXPECT TO CONTINUE TO MAKE INVESTMENTS IN INTERNATIONAL MARKETS, THESE INVESTMENTS MAY NOT RESULT IN AN INCREASE IN OUR\nINTERNATIONAL REVENUES AS A PERCENTAGE OF TOTAL REVENUES IN 2011 OR THEREAFTER.

THE FEES ARE NON-REFUNDABLE. FURTHER, THESE DISTRIBUTION ARRANGEMENTS ARE TERMINABLE AT WILL, ALTHOUGH UNDER THE TERMS OF CERTAIN CONTRACTS, WE OR OUR DISTRIBUTION PARTNERS MAY BE SUBJECT TO\nPENALTIES IN THE EVENT OF EARLY TERMINATION.

CASH EQUIVALENTS AND MARKETABLE SECURITIES ARE COMPRISED OF HIGHLY LIQUID DEBT INSTRUMENTS OF THE U.S. GOVERNMENT AND ITS AGENCIES, MUNICIPALITIES IN THE U.S., DEBT INSTRUMENTS ISSUED BY\nFOREIGN GOVERNMENTS, TIME DEPOSITS, MONEY MARKET AND OTHER FUNDS, INCLUDING CASH COLLATERAL RECEIVED RELATED TO OUR SECURITIES LENDING PROGRAM, MORTGAGE-BACKED SECURITIES, AND CORPORATE SECURITIES.\nAS OF DECEMBER 31, 2010, $16.7 BILLION OF THE $35.0 BILLION OF CASH, CASH EQUIVALENTS, AND MARKETABLE SECURITIES WAS HELD BY OUR FOREIGN\nSUBSIDIARIES. IF THESE FUNDS ARE NEEDED FOR OUR OPERATIONS IN THE U.S., WE WOULD BE REQUIRED TO ACCRUE AND PAY U.S. TAXES TO REPATRIATE THESE FUNDS. HOWEVER, OUR INTENT IS TO PERMANENTLY REINVEST THESE FUNDS OUTSIDE OF THE U.S. AND OUR CURRENT PLANS\nDO NOT DEMONSTRATE A NEED TO REPATRIATE THEM TO FUND OUR U.S. OPERATIONS.\nOUR PRINCIPAL SOURCES OF LIQUIDITY ARE OUR CASH, CASH\nEQUIVALENTS, AND MARKETABLE SECURITIES, AS WELL AS THE CASH FLOW THAT WE GENERATE FROM OUR OPERATIONS. AT DECEMBER 31, 2010, WE HAD UNUSED LETTERS OF CREDIT FOR APPROXIMATELY $65 MILLION. WE BELIEVE THAT OUR SOURCES OF FUNDING WILL BE\nSUFFICIENT TO SATISFY OUR CURRENTLY ANTICIPATED CASH REQUIREMENTS THROUGH AT LEAST THE NEXT 12 MONTHS. OUR LIQUIDITY COULD BE NEGATIVELY AFFECTED BY A DECREASE IN DEMAND FOR OUR PRODUCTS AND SERVICES. IN ADDITION, WE MAY MAKE ACQUISITIONS OR LICENSE\nPRODUCTS AND TECHNOLOGIES COMPLEMENTARY TO OUR BUSINESS AND MAY NEED TO RAISE ADDITIONAL CAPITAL THROUGH FUTURE DEBT OR EQUITY FINANCING TO PROVIDE FOR GREATER FLEXIBILITY TO FUND ANY SUCH ACQUISITIONS AND LICENSING ACTIVITIES. ADDITIONAL FINANCING\nMAY NOT BE AVAILABLE AT ALL OR ON TERMS FAVORABLE TO US.\n38\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nON JULY 1, 2010, WE SIGNED A DEFINITIVE AGREEMENT TO ACQUIRE ITA SOFTWARE, INC., A\nPRIVATELY-HELD FLIGHT INFORMATION SOFTWARE COMPANY, FOR $700 MILLION IN CASH, SUBJECT TO ADJUSTMENTS. THE COMPLETION OF THIS TRANSACTION IS SUBJECT TO CUSTOMARY CLOSING CONDITIONS. WE EXPECT THIS TRANSACTION TO CLOSE IN THE FIRST HALF OF 2011.\nON JULY 15, 2010, WE ANNOUNCED A DEBT FINANCING PROGRAM OF UP TO $3.0 BILLION THROUGH THE ISSUANCE OF COMMERCIAL PAPER. NET\nPROCEEDS FROM THE COMMERCIAL PAPER PROGRAM ARE USED FOR GENERAL CORPORATE PURPOSES. AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2010, WE HAD $3.0 BILLION OF COMMERCIAL PAPER OUTSTANDING RECORDED AS SHORT-TERM DEBT, WITH A WEIGHTED-AVERAGE INTEREST RATE OF 0.3% THAT\nMATURES AT VARIOUS DATES THROUGH NOVEMBER 2011. AVERAGE COMMERCIAL PAPER BORROWINGS DURING THE QUARTER WERE $2.3 BILLION, AND THE MAXIMUM AMOUNT OF COMMERCIAL PAPER BORROWINGS OUTSTANDING DURING THE QUARTER WAS $3.0 BILLION. IN CONJUNCTION WITH\nTHIS PROGRAM, WE ESTABLISHED A $3.0 BILLION REVOLVING CREDIT FACILITY EXPIRING ON JUNE 30, 2013. INTEREST RATE FOR THE CREDIT FACILITY IS DETERMINED BASED ON A FORMULA USING CERTAIN MARKET RATES. AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2010, WE WERE IN\nCOMPLIANCE WITH THE FINANCIAL COVENANT IN THE CREDIT FACILITY. NO AMOUNTS WERE OUTSTANDING UNDER THE CREDIT FACILITY AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2010.\nIN DECEMBER 2010, WE ISSUED A SECURED PROMISSORY NOTE IN THE AMOUNT OF $468 MILLION WITH AN INTEREST RATE OF 1.0% THAT MATURES IN ONE YEAR. PROCEEDS WERE USED FOR THE ACQUISITION OF AN OFFICE BUILDING IN NEW YORK\nCITY.\nCASH PROVIDED BY OPERATING ACTIVITIES CONSISTED OF NET INCOME ADJUSTED FOR CERTAIN NON-CASH ITEMS, INCLUDING AMORTIZATION,\nDEPRECIATION, DEFERRED INCOME TAXES, EXCESS TAX BENEFITS FROM STOCK-BASED AWARD ACTIVITIES, STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION EXPENSE, AND THE EFFECT OF CHANGES IN WORKING CAPITAL AND OTHER ACTIVITIES. CASH PROVIDED BY OPERATING ACTIVITIES IN 2010 WAS\n$11,081 MILLION, AND CONSISTED OF NET INCOME OF $8,505 MILLION, ADJUSTMENTS FOR NON-CASH ITEMS OF $2,675 MILLION, AND CASH USED IN WORKING CAPITAL AND OTHER ACTIVITIES OF $99 MILLION. ADJUSTMENTS FOR NON-CASH ITEMS PRIMARILY CONSISTED OF $1,376\nMILLION OF STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION EXPENSE, $1,067 MILLION OF DEPRECIATION AND AMORTIZATION EXPENSE ON PROPERTY AND EQUIPMENT, AND $329 MILLION OF AMORTIZATION OF INTANGIBLE AND OTHER ASSETS, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY $94 MILLION OF EXCESS TAX BENEFITS\nFROM STOCK-BASED AWARD ACTIVITIES. IN ADDITION, THE DECREASE IN CASH FROM CHANGES IN WORKING CAPITAL ACTIVITIES PRIMARILY CONSISTED OF AN INCREASE OF $1,129 MILLION IN ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE DUE TO THE GROWTH IN FEES BILLED TO OUR ADVERTISERS AND AN\nINCREASE OF $414 MILLION IN PREPAID REVENUE SHARE, EXPENSES AND OTHER ASSETS. THESE INCREASES WERE PARTIALLY OFFSET BY AN INCREASE IN ACCRUED EXPENSES AND OTHER LIABILITIES OF $745 MILLION, AN INCREASE IN ACCOUNTS PAYABLE OF $272 MILLION, AN\nINCREASE IN ACCRUED REVENUE SHARE OF $214 MILLION, AN INCREASE IN DEFERRED REVENUE OF $111 MILLION, AND A NET INCREASE IN INCOME TAX PAYABLE AND DEFERRED INCOME TAXES OF $102 MILLION, WHICH INCLUDES THE SAME $94 MILLION OF EXCESS TAX BENEFITS FROM\nSTOCK-BASED AWARD ACTIVITIES INCLUDED UNDER ADJUSTMENTS FOR NON-CASH ITEMS. THE INCREASE IN ACCRUED EXPENSE AND OTHER LIABILITIES, ACCOUNTS PAYABLE, ACCRUED REVENUE SHARE, AND DEFERRED REVENUES ARE PRIMARILY A RESULT OF THE GROWTH IN OUR BUSINESS\nAND HEADCOUNT. THE INCREASE IN NET INCOME TAXES PAYABLE AND DEFERRED INCOME TAXES WAS PRIMARILY A RESULT OF ADDITIONAL TAX OBLIGATIONS ACCRUED, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY THE RELEASE OF CERTAIN TAX RESERVES AS A RESULT OF THE SETTLEMENT OF OUR TAX AUDITS\nFOR OUR 2005 AND 2006 TAX YEARS.\nCASH PROVIDED BY OPERATING ACTIVITIES IN 2009 WAS $9,316 MILLION, AND CONSISTED OF NET INCOME OF\n$6,520 MILLION, ADJUSTMENTS FOR NON-CASH ITEMS OF $2,310 MILLION, AND CASH PROVIDED BY WORKING CAPITAL AND OTHER ACTIVITIES OF $486 MILLION. ADJUSTMENTS FOR NON-CASH ITEMS PRIMARILY CONSISTED OF $1,240 MILLION OF DEPRECIATION AND AMORTIZATION\nEXPENSE ON PROPERTY AND EQUIPMENT, $1,164 MILLION OF STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION EXPENSE, AND $284 MILLION OF AMORTIZATION OF INTANGIBLE AND OTHER ASSETS, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY $268 MILLION OF DEFERRED INCOME TAXES ON EARNINGS AND $90 MILLION OF EXCESS\nTAX BENEFITS FROM STOCK-BASED AWARD ACTIVITIES. IN ADDITION, CHANGES IN WORKING CAPITAL ACTIVITIES PRIMARILY CONSISTED OF A DECREASE OF $262 MILLION IN PREPAID REVENUE SHARE, EXPENSES, AND OTHER ASSETS, AN INCREASE IN ACCRUED EXPENSES AND OTHER\nLIABILITIES OF $243 MILLION WHICH IS A DIRECT RESULT OF THE GROWTH OF OUR BUSINESS, AND A NET INCREASE IN INCOME TAXES PAYABLE AND DEFERRED INCOME TAXES OF $217 MILLION, WHICH INCLUDES THE SAME $90 MILLION OF EXCESS TAX BENEFITS FROM STOCK-BASED\nAWARD ACTIVITIES INCLUDED UNDER ADJUSTMENTS FOR NON-CASH ITEMS, AND AN INCREASE IN ACCRUED REVENUE SHARE OF $158 MILLION. THESE INCREASES WERE PARTIALLY OFFSET BY AN INCREASE OF $504 MILLION IN ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE DUE TO THE GROWTH IN FEES BILLED TO\nOUR ADVERTISERS. THE INCREASE IN NET INCOME TAXES PAYABLE AND DEFERRED INCOME TAXES WAS PRIMARILY A RESULT OF ADDITIONAL TAX OBLIGATIONS ACCRUED, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY AN INCREASE IN THE AMOUNT OF ESTIMATED INCOME TAXES WE PAID DURING THE YEAR. THE\nINCREASE IN ACCRUED REVENUE SHARE WAS DUE TO THE GROWTH IN OUR ADSENSE AND DISTRIBUTION PROGRAMS AND THE TIMING OF PAYMENTS MADE TO OUR PARTNERS.\n39\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nCASH PROVIDED BY OPERATING ACTIVITIES IN 2008 WAS $7,853 MILLION, AND CONSISTED OF NET INCOME OF\n$4,227 MILLION, ADJUSTMENTS FOR NON-CASH ITEMS OF $3,299 MILLION, AND CASH PROVIDED BY WORKING CAPITAL AND OTHER ACTIVITIES OF $327 MILLION. ADJUSTMENTS FOR NON-CASH ITEMS PRIMARILY CONSISTED OF $1,212 MILLION OF DEPRECIATION AND AMORTIZATION\nEXPENSE ON PROPERTY AND EQUIPMENT, $1,120 MILLION OF STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION EXPENSE, AND $1,095 MILLION OF IMPAIRMENT CHARGES OF EQUITY INVESTMENTS, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY $225 MILLION OF DEFERRED INCOME TAXES ON EARNINGS, AND $159 MILLION OF EXCESS\nTAX BENEFITS FROM STOCK-BASED AWARD ACTIVITIES. IN ADDITION, CHANGES IN WORKING CAPITAL ACTIVITIES PRIMARILY CONSISTED OF A NET INCREASE IN INCOME TAXES PAYABLE AND DEFERRED INCOME TAXES OF $626 MILLION, WHICH INCLUDES THE SAME $159 MILLION OF\nEXCESS TAX BENEFITS FROM STOCK-BASED AWARD ACTIVITIES INCLUDED UNDER ADJUSTMENTS FOR NON-CASH ITEMS, AND AN INCREASE IN ACCRUED EXPENSES AND OTHER LIABILITIES OF $339 MILLION. THE INCREASES IN ACCRUED EXPENSES ARE A DIRECT RESULT OF THE GROWTH OF\nOUR BUSINESS AND AN INCREASE IN HEADCOUNT. THESE INCREASES TO WORKING CAPITAL ACTIVITIES WERE PARTIALLY OFFSET BY AN INCREASE OF $334 MILLION IN ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE DUE TO THE GROWTH IN FEES BILLED TO OUR ADVERTISERS, A DECREASE OF $212 MILLION IN\nACCOUNTS PAYABLE DUE TO THE TIMING OF INVOICE PROCESSING AND PAYMENTS AND AN INCREASE OF $147 MILLION IN PREPAID REVENUE SHARES, EXPENSES, AND OTHER ASSETS.\nAS WE EXPAND OUR BUSINESS INTERNATIONALLY, WE HAVE OFFERED PAYMENT TERMS TO CERTAIN ADVERTISERS THAT ARE STANDARD IN THEIR LOCALES BUT LONGER THAN TERMS WE WOULD GENERALLY OFFER TO OUR DOMESTIC ADVERTISERS. THIS\nMAY INCREASE OUR WORKING CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS AND MAY HAVE A NEGATIVE EFFECT ON CASH PROVIDED BY OUR OPERATING ACTIVITIES.\nCASH USED IN\nINVESTING ACTIVITIES IN 2010 OF $10,680 MILLION WAS PRIMARILY ATTRIBUTABLE TO NET PURCHASES OF MARKETABLE SECURITIES OF $6,886 MILLION, CAPITAL EXPENDITURES OF $4,018 MILLION OF WHICH $1.8 BILLION WAS FOR THE PURCHASE OF AN OFFICE BUILDING IN NEW\nYORK CITY IN DECEMBER 2010, AND REMAINING AMOUNTS RELATED PRINCIPALLY TO OUR DATA CENTERS AND RELATED EQUIPMENT, AND CASH CONSIDERATION USED IN ACQUISITIONS AND OTHER INVESTMENTS OF $1,067 MILLION. ALSO, IN CONNECTION WITH OUR SECURITIES LENDING\nPROGRAM, WE RECEIVED $2,361 MILLION OF CASH COLLATERAL WHICH WAS INVESTED IN REVERSE REPURCHASE AGREEMENTS. OF THE $2,361 MILLION, $1,611 MILLION WAS CLASSIFIED AS CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS, AND $750 MILLION WAS CLASSIFIED AS RECEIVABLE UNDER\nREVERSE REPURCHASE AGREEMENTS ON THE ACCOMPANYING CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEET. SEE NOTE 3 OF NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS INCLUDED IN ITEM 8 OF THIS ANNUAL REPORT ON FORM 10-K FOR FURTHER INFORMATION ABOUT OUR SECURITIES LENDING\nPROGRAM.\nCASH USED IN INVESTING ACTIVITIES IN 2009 OF $8,019 MILLION WAS PRIMARILY ATTRIBUTABLE TO NET PURCHASES OF MARKETABLE\nSECURITIES OF $7,036 MILLION AND CAPITAL EXPENDITURES OF $810 MILLION.\nCASH USED IN INVESTING ACTIVITIES IN 2008 OF $5,319 MILLION WAS\nPRIMARILY ATTRIBUTABLE TO CASH CONSIDERATION USED IN ACQUISITIONS AND OTHER INVESTMENTS OF $3,367 MILLION PRIMARILY RELATED TO THE ACQUISITION OF DOUBLECLICK AND CAPITAL EXPENDITURES OF $2,359 MILLION, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY NET MATURITIES AND SALES OF\nMARKETABLE SECURITIES OF $407 MILLION INCLUDING OUR INVESTMENT IN CLEARWIRE.\nIN ORDER TO MANAGE EXPECTED INCREASES IN INTERNET TRAFFIC,\nADVERTISING TRANSACTIONS, AND NEW PRODUCTS AND SERVICES, AND TO SUPPORT OUR OVERALL GLOBAL BUSINESS EXPANSION, WE EXPECT TO MAKE SIGNIFICANT INVESTMENTS IN OUR SYSTEMS, DATA CENTERS, CORPORATE FACILITIES, INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY INFRASTRUCTURE, AND\nEMPLOYEES IN 2011 AND THEREAFTER. HOWEVER, THE AMOUNT OF OUR CAPITAL EXPENDITURES HAS FLUCTUATED AND MAY CONTINUE TO FLUCTUATE ON A QUARTERLY BASIS.\nIN ADDITION, WE EXPECT TO SPEND A SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT OF CASH ON ACQUISITIONS AND OTHER INVESTMENTS FROM TIME TO TIME. THESE ACQUISITIONS GENERALLY ENHANCE THE BREADTH AND DEPTH OF OUR EXPERTISE IN ENGINEERING AND\nOTHER FUNCTIONAL AREAS, OUR TECHNOLOGIES, AND OUR PRODUCT OFFERINGS.\nCASH PROVIDED BY FINANCING ACTIVITIES IN 2010 OF $3,050 MILLION\nWAS PRIMARILY DRIVEN BY $3,463 MILLION OF NET CASH PROCEEDS FROM THE ISSUANCE OF COMMERCIAL PAPER AND A PROMISSORY NOTE. THIS WAS PARTIALLY OFFSET BY $801\n40\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nMILLION IN STOCK REPURCHASES IN CONNECTION WITH OUR ACQUISITIONS OF ADMOB AND ON2 TECHNOLOGIES, INC. (ON2), AS WELL AS NET PROCEEDS FROM STOCK-BASED AWARD ACTIVITIES OF $294 MILLION, AND EXCESS\nTAX BENEFITS FROM STOCK-BASED AWARD ACTIVITIES OF $94 MILLION.\nCASH PROVIDED BY FINANCING ACTIVITIES IN 2009 OF $233 MILLION WAS\nPRIMARILY DUE TO NET PROCEEDS RELATED TO STOCK-BASED AWARD ACTIVITIES OF $143 MILLION. IN ADDITION, THERE WERE EXCESS TAX BENEFITS OF $90 MILLION FROM STOCK-BASED AWARD ACTIVITIES DURING THE PERIOD WHICH REPRESENTED A PORTION OF THE $260 MILLION\nREDUCTION TO INCOME TAXES PAYABLE THAT WE RECORDED IN 2009 RELATED TO THE TOTAL DIRECT TAX BENEFIT REALIZED FROM THE EXERCISE, SALE, OR VESTING OF THESE AWARDS.\nCASH PROVIDED BY FINANCING ACTIVITIES IN 2008 OF $87 MILLION WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO EXCESS TAX BENEFITS OF $159 MILLION FROM STOCK-BASED AWARD ACTIVITIES DURING THE PERIOD WHICH REPRESENTS A PORTION OF THE $251\nMILLION REDUCTION TO INCOME TAX PAYABLE THAT WE RECORDED IN 2008 RELATED TO THE TOTAL DIRECT TAX BENEFIT REALIZED FROM THE EXERCISE, SALE, OR VESTING OF THESE AWARDS, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY NET PAYMENTS RELATED TO STOCK-BASED AWARD ACTIVITIES OF $72\nMILLION.\nCONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2010\nPAYMENTS DUE BY PERIOD\nTOTAL\nLESS THAN\n1 YEAR\n1-3\nYEARS\n3-5\nYEARS\nMORE THAN\n5 YEARS\n(UNAUDITED, IN MILLIONS)\nOPERATING LEASE OBLIGATIONS\n$2,305\n$310\n$567\n$385\n$1,043\nPURCHASE OBLIGATIONS\n565\n214\n207\n87\n57\nOTHER LONG-TERM LIABILITIES REFLECTED ON OUR BALANCE SHEET\n264\n54\n171\n15\n24\nTOTAL CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS\n$3,134\n$578\n$945\n$487\n$1,124\nTHE ABOVE TABLE DOES NOT INCLUDE FUTURE RENTAL INCOME OF $812 MILLION RELATED TO THE LEASES THAT WE ASSUMED IN\nCONNECTION WITH OUR PURCHASE OF AN OFFICE BUILDING IN NEW YORK CITY.\nOPERATING LEASES\nWE HAVE ENTERED INTO VARIOUS NON-CANCELABLE OPERATING LEASE AGREEMENTS FOR CERTAIN OF OUR OFFICES, LAND, AND DATA CENTERS THROUGHOUT THE WORLD WITH\nORIGINAL LEASE PERIODS EXPIRING BETWEEN 2011 AND 2063. WE ARE COMMITTED TO PAY A PORTION OF THE RELATED OPERATING EXPENSES UNDER CERTAIN OF THESE LEASE AGREEMENTS. THESE OPERATING EXPENSES ARE NOT INCLUDED IN THE ABOVE TABLE. CERTAIN OF THESE LEASES\nHAVE FREE OR ESCALATING RENT PAYMENT PROVISIONS. WE RECOGNIZE RENT EXPENSE UNDER SUCH LEASES ON A STRAIGHT-LINE BASIS OVER THE TERM OF THE LEASE. CERTAIN LEASES HAVE ADJUSTMENTS FOR MARKET PROVISIONS.\nPURCHASE OBLIGATIONS\nPURCHASE OBLIGATIONS REPRESENT NON-CANCELABLE CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS AT DECEMBER 31, 2010. IN ADDITION, WE HAD $2.4 BILLION OF OPEN PURCHASE\nORDERS FOR WHICH WE HAVE NOT RECEIVED THE RELATED SERVICES OR GOODS AT DECEMBER 31, 2010. THIS AMOUNT IS NOT INCLUDED IN THE ABOVE TABLE BECAUSE WE HAVE THE RIGHT TO CANCEL THE PURCHASE ORDERS PRIOR TO THE DATE OF DELIVERY. THE MAJORITY OF OUR\nNON-CANCELABLE CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS ARE RELATED TO DATA CENTER OPERATIONS AND FACILITY BUILD-OUTS.\n41\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nOTHER LONG-TERM LIABILITIES\nOTHER LONG-TERM LIABILITIES CONSIST OF CASH OBLIGATIONS, PRIMARILY THE LEGAL SETTLEMENT WITH THE AUTHORS GUILD AND THE AAP, AND MILESTONE AND\nROYALTY PAYMENTS OWED IN CONNECTION WITH CERTAIN ACQUISITIONS AND LICENSING AGREEMENTS.\nIN ADDITION, WE RECORDED ADDITIONAL LONG-TERM\nTAXES PAYABLE OF $289 MILLION IN 2010 RELATED TO TAX POSITIONS FOR WHICH THE TIMING OF THE ULTIMATE RESOLUTION IS UNCERTAIN. AT THIS TIME, WE ARE UNABLE TO MAKE A REASONABLY RELIABLE ESTIMATE OF THE TIMING OF PAYMENTS IN INDIVIDUAL YEARS BEYOND 12\nMONTHS DUE TO UNCERTAINTIES IN THE TIMING OF TAX AUDIT OUTCOMES. AS A RESULT, THIS AMOUNT IS NOT INCLUDED IN THE ABOVE TABLE.\nOFF-BALANCE SHEET\nENTITIES\nAT DECEMBER 31, 2010, WE DID NOT HAVE ANY OFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS, AS DEFINED IN ITEM 303(A)(4)(II) OF\nREGULATION S-K PROMULGATED BY THE SEC, THAT HAVE OR ARE REASONABLY LIKELY TO HAVE A CURRENT OR FUTURE EFFECT ON OUR FINANCIAL CONDITION, CHANGES IN OUR FINANCIAL CONDITION, REVENUES, OR EXPENSES, RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, LIQUIDITY, CAPITAL\nEXPENDITURES, OR CAPITAL RESOURCES THAT IS MATERIAL TO INVESTORS.\nCRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES\nWE PREPARE OUR CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS IN ACCORDANCE WITH ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES GENERALLY ACCEPTED IN THE U.S. (U.S. GAAP). IN DOING SO,\nWE HAVE TO MAKE ESTIMATES AND ASSUMPTIONS THAT AFFECT OUR REPORTED AMOUNTS OF ASSETS, LIABILITIES, REVENUES, AND EXPENSES, AS WELL AS RELATED DISCLOSURE OF CONTINGENT ASSETS AND LIABILITIES. IN SOME CASES, WE COULD REASONABLY HAVE USED DIFFERENT\nACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES. IN SOME CASES, CHANGES IN THE ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES ARE REASONABLY LIKELY TO OCCUR FROM PERIOD TO PERIOD. ACCORDINGLY, ACTUAL RESULTS COULD DIFFER MATERIALLY FROM OUR ESTIMATES. TO THE EXTENT THAT THERE ARE MATERIAL\nDIFFERENCES BETWEEN THESE ESTIMATES AND ACTUAL RESULTS, OUR FINANCIAL CONDITION OR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS WILL BE AFFECTED. WE BASE OUR ESTIMATES ON PAST EXPERIENCE AND OTHER ASSUMPTIONS THAT WE BELIEVE ARE REASONABLE UNDER THE CIRCUMSTANCES, AND WE\nEVALUATE THESE ESTIMATES ON AN ONGOING BASIS. WE REFER TO ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES OF THIS TYPE AS CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES, WHICH WE DISCUSS FURTHER BELOW. WE HAVE REVIEWED OUR CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES WITH THE AUDIT\nCOMMITTEE OF OUR BOARD OF DIRECTORS.\nINCOME TAXES\nWE ARE SUBJECT TO INCOME TAXES IN THE U.S. AND NUMEROUS FOREIGN JURISDICTIONS. SIGNIFICANT JUDGMENT IS REQUIRED IN EVALUATING OUR UNCERTAIN TAX POSITIONS AND DETERMINING OUR PROVISION FOR INCOME TAXES.\nALTHOUGH WE BELIEVE WE HAVE ADEQUATELY RESERVED FOR OUR UNCERTAIN TAX POSITIONS, NO ASSURANCE CAN BE GIVEN THAT THE FINAL TAX OUTCOME OF THESE\nMATTERS WILL NOT BE DIFFERENT. WE ADJUST THESE RESERVES IN LIGHT OF CHANGING FACTS AND CIRCUMSTANCES, SUCH AS THE CLOSING OF A TAX AUDIT OR THE REFINEMENT OF AN ESTIMATE. TO THE EXTENT THAT THE FINAL TAX OUTCOME OF THESE MATTERS IS DIFFERENT THAN\nTHE AMOUNTS RECORDED, SUCH DIFFERENCES WILL IMPACT THE PROVISION FOR INCOME TAXES IN THE PERIOD IN WHICH SUCH DETERMINATION IS MADE. THE PROVISION FOR INCOME TAXES INCLUDES THE IMPACT OF RESERVE PROVISIONS AND CHANGES TO RESERVES THAT ARE CONSIDERED\nAPPROPRIATE, AS WELL AS THE RELATED NET INTEREST.\nOUR EFFECTIVE TAX RATES HAVE DIFFERED FROM THE STATUTORY RATE PRIMARILY DUE TO THE\nTAX IMPACT OF FOREIGN OPERATIONS, STATE TAXES, CERTAIN BENEFITS REALIZED RELATED TO STOCK OPTION ACTIVITIES, AND RESEARCH AND EXPERIMENTATION TAX CREDITS. THE EFFECTIVE TAX RATES WERE 27.8%, 22.2%, AND 21.2% FOR 2008, 2009, AND 2010. OUR FUTURE\nEFFECTIVE TAX RATES COULD BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED BY EARNINGS BEING LOWER THAN ANTICIPATED IN COUNTRIES WHERE WE HAVE LOWER STATUTORY RATES AND HIGHER THAN ANTICIPATED IN COUNTRIES WHERE WE HAVE HIGHER STATUTORY RATES, THE NET GAINS AND LOSSES\nRECOGNIZED BY LEGAL ENTITIES ON CERTAIN HEDGES AND RELATED HEDGED INTERCOMPANY AND OTHER TRANSACTIONS UNDER OUR FOREIGN EXCHANGE RISK MANAGEMENT PROGRAM, CHANGES IN THE VALUATION OF OUR DEFERRED TAX\n42\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nASSETS OR LIABILITIES, OR CHANGES IN TAX LAWS, REGULATIONS, AND ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES. IN ADDITION, WE ARE SUBJECT TO THE CONTINUOUS EXAMINATION OF OUR INCOME TAX RETURNS BY THE IRS AND OTHER TAX\nAUTHORITIES. WE REGULARLY ASSESS THE LIKELIHOOD OF ADVERSE OUTCOMES RESULTING FROM THESE EXAMINATIONS TO DETERMINE THE ADEQUACY OF OUR PROVISION FOR INCOME TAXES.\nLOSS CONTINGENCIES\nWE ARE INVOLVED IN CLAIMS, SUITS, GOVERNMENT INVESTIGATIONS, AND\nPROCEEDINGS ARISING FROM THE ORDINARY COURSE OF OUR BUSINESS. WE RECORD A PROVISION FOR A LIABILITY WHEN WE BELIEVE THAT IT IS BOTH PROBABLE THAT A LIABILITY HAS BEEN INCURRED, AND THE AMOUNT CAN BE REASONABLY ESTIMATED. SIGNIFICANT JUDGMENT IS\nREQUIRED TO DETERMINE BOTH PROBABILITY AND THE ESTIMATED AMOUNT. SUCH LEGAL PROCEEDINGS ARE INHERENTLY UNPREDICTABLE AND SUBJECT TO SIGNIFICANT UNCERTAINTIES, SOME OF WHICH ARE BEYOND OUR CONTROL. SHOULD ANY OF THESE ESTIMATES AND ASSUMPTIONS CHANGE\nOR PROVE TO HAVE BEEN INCORRECT, IT COULD HAVE A MATERIAL IMPACT ON OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, FINANCIAL POSITION AND CASH FLOWS. SEE NOTE 12 OF NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS INCLUDED IN ITEM 8 OF THIS ANNUAL REPORT ON FORM\n10-K FOR ADDITIONAL INFORMATION REGARDING LEGAL CONTINGENCIES.\nSTOCK-BASED COMPENSATION\nOUR STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION EXPENSE IS ESTIMATED AT THE GRANT DATE BASED ON THE AWARD\u0092S FAIR VALUE AS CALCULATED BY THE BLACK-SCHOLES-MERTON\n(BSM) OPTION PRICING MODEL AND IS RECOGNIZED AS EXPENSE OVER THE REQUISITE SERVICE PERIOD. THE BSM MODEL REQUIRES VARIOUS HIGHLY JUDGMENTAL ASSUMPTIONS INCLUDING EXPECTED VOLATILITY AND EXPECTED TERM. IF ANY OF THE ASSUMPTIONS USED IN THE BSM MODEL\nCHANGES SIGNIFICANTLY, STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION EXPENSE MAY DIFFER MATERIALLY IN THE FUTURE FROM THAT RECORDED IN THE CURRENT PERIOD. IN ADDITION, WE ARE REQUIRED TO ESTIMATE THE EXPECTED FORFEITURE RATE AND ONLY RECOGNIZE EXPENSE FOR THOSE SHARES\nEXPECTED TO VEST. WE ESTIMATE THE FORFEITURE RATE BASED ON HISTORICAL EXPERIENCE. TO THE EXTENT OUR ACTUAL FORFEITURE RATE IS DIFFERENT FROM OUR ESTIMATE, STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION EXPENSE IS ADJUSTED ACCORDINGLY.\nIMPAIRMENT OF MARKETABLE AND NON-MARKETABLE SECURITIES\nWE PERIODICALLY REVIEW OUR MARKETABLE SECURITIES AND OUR NON-MARKETABLE EQUITY SECURITIES FOR IMPAIRMENT. IF WE CONCLUDE THAT ANY OF THESE INVESTMENTS ARE IMPAIRED, WE DETERMINE WHETHER SUCH IMPAIRMENT IS\nOTHER-THAN-TEMPORARY. FACTORS WE CONSIDER TO MAKE SUCH DETERMINATION INCLUDE THE DURATION AND SEVERITY OF THE IMPAIRMENT, THE REASON FOR THE DECLINE IN VALUE, THE POTENTIAL RECOVERY PERIOD, AND OUR INTENT TO SELL, OR WHETHER IT IS MORE LIKELY THAN\nNOT THAT WE WILL BE REQUIRED TO SELL, THE INVESTMENT BEFORE RECOVERY. IF ANY IMPAIRMENT IS CONSIDERED OTHER-THAN-TEMPORARY, WE WILL WRITE DOWN THE ASSET TO ITS FAIR VALUE AND TAKE A CORRESPONDING CHARGE TO OUR CONSOLIDATED STATEMENT OF INCOME.\n43\nTABLE OF CONTENTS","5754":"ITEM 7.\nMANAGEMENT\u0092S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nFORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS\nIN\nADDITION TO CURRENT AND HISTORICAL INFORMATION, THIS ANNUAL REPORT ON FORM 10-K CONTAINS FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS WITHIN THE MEANING OF THE PRIVATE SECURITIES LITIGATION REFORM ACT OF 1995.

PROPERTIES AND NON-EXCLUSIVE PROVIDER OF SUCH SERVICES ON AFFILIATE SITES ARE BEING DONE ON A MARKET BY\nMARKET BASIS AND ARE EXPECTED TO CONTINUE THROUGH EARLY 2012. THE TRANSITION OCCURRED IN THE UNITED STATES (\u0093U.S.\u0094) AND CANADA IN THE FOURTH QUARTER OF 2010, AND WE CONTINUE TO TRANSITION ALGORITHMIC AND PAID SEARCH IN OTHER MARKETS. THE\nSEARCH AGREEMENT TERMINATES IN FEBRUARY 2020, SUBJECT TO EARLIER TERMINATION AS PROVIDED IN THE SEARCH AGREEMENT.\nUNDER THE SEARCH AGREEMENT,\nMICROSOFT HAS AGREED TO REIMBURSE US FOR CERTAIN TRANSITION COSTS UP TO AN AGGREGATE TOTAL OF $150 MILLION DURING THE FIRST THREE YEARS OF THE SEARCH AGREEMENT. FROM FEBRUARY 23, 2010 UNTIL THE APPLICABLE SERVICES ARE FULLY TRANSITIONED TO\nMICROSOFT, MICROSOFT WILL ALSO REIMBURSE US FOR THE COSTS OF RUNNING OUR ALGORITHMIC AND PAID SEARCH SERVICES SUBJECT TO SPECIFIED EXCLUSIONS AND LIMITATIONS.

AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2010, WE HAD INCURRED A\nTOTAL OF $414 MILLION OF REIMBURSABLE EXPENSES RELATED TO THE SEARCH AGREEMENT. OF THAT AMOUNT, $350 MILLION HAD BEEN RECEIVED FROM MICROSOFT, AND $64 MILLION WAS CLASSIFIED AS PART OF PREPAID EXPENSES AND OTHER CURRENT ASSETS ON OUR CONSOLIDATED\nBALANCE SHEETS AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2010.

WE EXPENSE TAC UNDER TWO DIFFERENT METHODS. AGREEMENTS WITH FIXED PAYMENTS ARE EXPENSED RATABLY OVER THE TERM THE FIXED PAYMENT COVERS, AND AGREEMENTS BASED ON A PERCENTAGE OF REVENUE, NUMBER OF SEARCHES, OR OTHER METRICS ARE EXPENSED\nBASED ON THE VOLUME OF THE UNDERLYING ACTIVITY OR REVENUE MULTIPLIED BY THE AGREED-UPON PRICE OR RATE.\nCOMPENSATION, INFORMATION\nTECHNOLOGY, DEPRECIATION AND AMORTIZATION, AND FACILITIES EXPENSES.\nCOMPENSATION EXPENSE CONSISTS PRIMARILY OF SALARY, BONUSES, COMMISSIONS, AND STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION EXPENSE.

TOTAL COMPENSATION EXPENSE DECREASED APPROXIMATELY $201 MILLION FOR THE YEAR ENDED\nDECEMBER 31, 2010, COMPARED TO 2009. THE DECREASE WAS PRIMARILY DRIVEN BY A DECREASE IN STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION EXPENSE DUE TO RECENTLY GRANTED STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION AWARDS HAVING A LOWER GRANT DATE FAIR VALUE THAN STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION\nAWARDS CURRENTLY VESTING. THE DECLINE IN STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION WAS OFFSET BY INCREASED SALARIES AND WAGES FROM INCREASED AVERAGE HEADCOUNT, PRIMARILY IN THE PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT AND SALES AND MARKETING FUNCTIONS. FOR THE YEAR ENDED\nDECEMBER 31, 2010, WE RECORDED REIMBURSEMENTS FROM MICROSOFT OF $200 MILLION, FOR EMPLOYEE COSTS, FOR WHICH THERE WERE NO SIMILAR REIMBURSEMENTS IN 2009. FOR THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2010, THE NET IMPACT OF THE REIMBURSEMENTS BY\nMICROSOFT FOR OUR COST OF RUNNING SEARCH WAS A REDUCTION IN COMPENSATION EXPENSE OF $117 MILLION, COMPARED TO 2009. TOTAL COMPENSATION EXPENSE DECREASED APPROXIMATELY $281 MILLION FOR THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2009, COMPARED TO 2008. THE\nDECREASE WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO DECREASES IN OUR AVERAGE TOTAL HEADCOUNT ACROSS ALL FUNCTIONS, PRIMARILY IN THE SALES AND MARKETING FUNCTION, AS A RESULT OF OUR COST REDUCTION INITIATIVES.\nINFORMATION TECHNOLOGY EXPENSES\n. INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY EXPENSES DECREASED $76 MILLION FOR THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2010, COMPARED TO 2009. THE DECLINE FOR THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31,\n2010 WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO REIMBURSEMENTS RECORDED FROM MICROSOFT OF $95 MILLION FOR INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY COSTS, FOR WHICH THERE WERE NO SIMILAR REIMBURSEMENTS IN 2009. FOR THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2010, THE NET IMPACT OF THE REIMBURSEMENTS\nBY MICROSOFT FOR OUR COST OF RUNNING SEARCH WAS A REDUCTION IN INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY EXPENSE OF $95 MILLION COMPARED TO 2009. INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY EXPENSES DECREASED $27 MILLION FOR THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2009, COMPARED TO 2008.\nTHE DECREASES WERE DUE TO DECREASED TELECOM USAGE AS WELL AS DECREASED EQUIPMENT SPENDING.\nDEPRECIATION AND AMORTIZATION EXPENSES.\nDEPRECIATION AND AMORTIZATION EXPENSES DECREASED $82 MILLION FOR THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2010, COMPARED TO 2009. THE DECLINE WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO DECREASED AMORTIZATION EXPENSE FOR INTANGIBLE ASSETS ASSOCIATED WITH DIVESTED BUSINESS LINES\nAS WELL AS FULLY AMORTIZED INTANGIBLE ASSETS ACQUIRED IN PRIOR YEARS. FOR THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2010, WE RECORDED REIMBURSEMENTS FROM MICROSOFT OF $26 MILLION FOR DEPRECIATION AND AMORTIZATION COSTS, FOR WHICH THERE WERE NO SIMILAR\nREIMBURSEMENTS IN 2009. FOR THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2010, THE NET IMPACT OF THE REIMBURSEMENTS BY MICROSOFT FOR OUR COST OF RUNNING SEARCH WAS A REDUCTION IN DEPRECIATION AND AMORTIZATION EXPENSE OF $26 MILLION COMPARED TO 2009.\nDEPRECIATION AND AMORTIZATION EXPENSES DECREASED $51 MILLION FOR THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2009, COMPARED TO 2008.

THE DECREASE WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO THE CHANGE IN THE RECORDING OF TAC IN THE FOURTH QUARTER OF 2010 DUE TO THE SEARCH AGREEMENT WITH MICROSOFT AS WE NO LONGER INCUR TAC FOR TRANSITIONED MARKETS. WE NOW\nRECEIVE AN 88 PERCENT REVENUE SHARE IN THE TRANSITIONED MARKETS AS MICROSOFT IS THE PRIMARY OBLIGOR TO THE ADVERTISERS. THE DECREASE WAS OFFSET BY INCREASES IN TAC DUE TO A NEW AFFILIATE IN THE ASIA PACIFIC SEGMENT ADDED IN THE FOURTH QUARTER OF\n2009 AS WELL AS INCREASES IN REVENUE FROM AFFILIATE SITES. TAC DECREASED $32 MILLION FOR THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2009, COMPARED TO 2008. THE DECREASE WAS PRIMARILY DRIVEN BY THE IMPACT OF FOREIGN CURRENCY RATE FLUCTUATIONS, OFFSET BY\nCHANGES IN AFFILIATE MIX AND A SMALL INCREASE IN AVERAGE TAC RATES.\n39\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nFACILITIES AND OTHER EXPENSES\n. FACILITIES AND OTHER EXPENSES DECREASED $121 MILLION FOR THE YEAR\nENDED DECEMBER 31, 2010, COMPARED TO 2009 MAINLY DUE TO DECREASES IN RESTRUCTURING CHARGES OF $69 MILLION, THIRD-PARTY SERVICE-PROVIDER EXPENSES OF $45 MILLION, AND DECREASES IN LEGAL SETTLEMENTS OF $21 MILLION, OFFSET BY INCREASES IN\nMARKETING EXPENSES OF $33 MILLION.

FOR THE YEAR ENDED\nDECEMBER 31, 2010, THE NET IMPACT OF THE REIMBURSEMENTS BY MICROSOFT FOR OUR COST OF RUNNING SEARCH AND TRANSITION COSTS INCURRED IN 2009 WAS A REDUCTION IN FACILITIES AND OTHER EXPENSES OF $73 MILLION COMPARED TO 2009. THIRD-PARTY\nSERVICE-PROVIDER EXPENSES DECREASED PRIMARILY DUE TO LOWER ADVISORY AND CONSULTING COSTS. MARKETING-RELATED EXPENSES INCREASED DURING THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2010 COMPARED TO 2009 DUE TO ADDITIONAL 2010 MARKETING CAMPAIGNS INCLUDING OUR\nGLOBAL BRANDING CAMPAIGN.\nFACILITIES AND OTHER EXPENSES DECREASED $730 MILLION FOR THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2009, COMPARED TO\n2008 MAINLY DUE TO DECREASES OF $488 MILLION RELATED TO THE GOODWILL IMPAIRMENT CHARGE RECORDED IN 2008 FOR WHICH THERE WAS NO COMPARABLE CHARGE IN 2009, DECREASES IN THIRD-PARTY SERVICE-PROVIDER EXPENSES OF $117 MILLION, DECREASES IN CONTENT\nCOSTS OF $57 MILLION, AND DECREASES IN EMPLOYEE TRAVEL AND ENTERTAINMENT COSTS OF $39 MILLION. DECREASES IN THIRD-PARTY SERVICE-PROVIDER EXPENSES WERE PRIMARILY DUE TO HIGHER ADVISOR COSTS INCURRED IN 2008 RELATED TO MICROSOFT\u0092S PROPOSAL TO\nACQUIRE ALL OR A PART OF YAHOO!, OTHER STRATEGIC ALTERNATIVES, INCLUDING THE GOOGLE AGREEMENT, THE PROXY CONTEST, AND RELATED LITIGATION DEFENSE, COMPARED TO ADVISORY AND EMPLOYEE RETENTION COSTS INCURRED IN 2009 IN CONNECTION WITH THE MICROSOFT\nSEARCH ARRANGEMENT. THE DECREASES IN THIRD-PARTY SERVICE PROVIDER EXPENSES WERE ALSO DUE TO A DECREASE IN TEMPORARY HEADCOUNT AND CONSULTING PROJECTS RELATED TO OUR COST INITIATIVES IN 2009. CONTENT COSTS, INCLUDED IN COSTS OF REVENUE AND DRIVEN BY\nOUR RICH MEDIA OFFERINGS, DECREASED DUE TO LOWER CONTENT COSTS FOR VARIOUS PROPERTIES AS WE TRANSITION OUT OF AND\/OR OUTSOURCE CERTAIN BUSINESS LINES.\nWE CURRENTLY EXPECT OUR OPERATING COSTS TO DECREASE FOR THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2011, COMPARED TO THE SAME PERIOD OF 2010, PRIMARILY DUE TO LOWER WORKFORCE EXPENSES DRIVEN BY RESTRUCTURING ACTIVITIES AND\nHIGHER MARKETING EXPENSES IN 2010 THAN 2011 AS WE CONTINUE OUR EFFORTS TO DRIVE EFFICIENCIES AND ALIGN OUR SPENDING WITH OUR STRATEGIC PRIORITIES.\nRESTRUCTURING CHARGES, NET.\nFOR THE YEARS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2008, 2009, AND 2010, RESTRUCTURING CHARGES, NET WAS COMPRISED OF THE FOLLOWING (IN THOUSANDS).\nYEARS ENDED DECEMBER 31,\n2008\n2009\n2010\nEMPLOYEE SEVERANCE PAY AND RELATED COSTS\n$109,548\n$48,696\n$39,652\nNON-CANCELABLE LEASE, CONTRACT TERMINATIONS, AND OTHER CHARGES\n19,617\n59,285\n19,737\nOTHER NON-CASH CHARGES\n7,925\n7,858\n2,779\nSUB-TOTAL BEFORE (REVERSALS) ACCELERATIONS OF STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION EXPENSE\n137,090\n115,839\n62,168\n(REVERSALS) ACCELERATIONS OF STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION EXPENSE\n(30,236\n)\n11,062\n(4,211\n)\nRESTRUCTURING CHARGES, NET\n$106,854\n$126,901\n$57,957\nQ108 RESTRUCTURING PLAN.\nDURING THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2008, WE IMPLEMENTED A STRATEGIC WORKFORCE REALIGNMENT TO MORE\nAPPROPRIATELY ALLOCATE RESOURCES TO OUR KEY STRATEGIC INITIATIVES. THE STRATEGIC WORKFORCE REALIGNMENT INVOLVED INVESTING RESOURCES IN SOME AREAS, REDUCING RESOURCES IN OTHERS, AND ELIMINATING SOME AREAS OF OUR BUSINESS THAT DID NOT SUPPORT OUR\nSTRATEGIC PRIORITIES. DURING THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2008, WE INCURRED TOTAL PRE-TAX CHARGES OF APPROXIMATELY $27 MILLION IN SEVERANCE PAY EXPENSES AND RELATED CASH EXPENSES IN CONNECTION WITH THIS WORKFORCE REALIGNMENT, NET OF\nREVERSAL FOR ADJUSTMENTS TO ORIGINAL ESTIMATES TOTALING $2 MILLION.

WE BEGAN TO CONSOLIDATE AND EXIT SELECTED FACILITIES BEGINNING IN THE FOURTH QUARTER OF 2008 AND CONTINUED THIS PROCESS THROUGH THE SECOND QUARTER OF\n2010. WE VACATED AND CEASED USE OF THE FACILITIES IDENTIFIED UNDER THE PLAN. NON-CANCELABLE LEASE COSTS WERE DETERMINED BASED ON THE PRESENT VALUE OF REMAINING LEASE PAYMENTS REDUCED BY ESTIMATED SUBLEASE INCOME. PRESENT VALUE COMPUTATIONS USE\nDISCOUNT RATES BASED ON PUBLISHED TREASURY RISK-FREE INTEREST RATES, ADJUSTED FOR OUR CREDIT SPREAD, WHICH IS CONSISTENT WITH OBSERVABLE CREDIT SPREADS OF COMPANIES WITH SIMILAR CREDIT STANDING. THE COST OF EXITING AND TERMINATING OUR FACILITY\nLEASES WAS DETERMINED BY REFERRING TO THE CONTRACTUAL TERMS OF THE AGREEMENTS, BY EVALUATING THE CURRENT REAL ESTATE MARKET CONDITIONS, AND, WHERE APPLICABLE, BY REFERRING TO AMOUNTS IN NEGOTIATION. OUR ABILITY TO GENERATE THE ESTIMATED AMOUNTS OF\nSUBLEASE INCOME, AS WELL AS TO TERMINATE LEASE OBLIGATIONS AT THE ESTIMATED AMOUNTS, IS DEPENDENT UPON THE COMMERCIAL REAL ESTATE MARKET CONDITIONS IN CERTAIN GEOGRAPHIES AT THE TIME WE NEGOTIATE THE LEASE TERMINATION AND SUBLEASE ARRANGEMENTS WITH\nTHIRD PARTIES. THESE AMOUNTS REPRESENT OUR BEST ESTIMATE OF THE OBLIGATIONS WE EXPECT TO INCUR AND COULD BE SUBJECT TO ADJUSTMENT AS MARKET CONDITIONS CHANGE. THE FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENT OF THE LIABILITY RELATED TO EXITED FACILITIES INVOLVES THE USE\nOF CERTAIN SIGNIFICANT UNOBSERVABLE INPUTS AND THEREFORE FALL WITHIN LEVEL 3 OF THE FAIR VALUE HIERARCHY ESTABLISHED BY ACCOUNTING GUIDANCE (DESCRIBED IN NOTE 8\u0097\u0093INVESTMENTS\u0094 IN THE NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n). THE REMAINING LEASE OBLIGATIONS WILL BE SETTLED OVER THE REMAINING LEASE TERMS WHICH EXPIRE THROUGH FISCAL 2017 AND WILL BE ADJUSTED FOR CHANGES IN ESTIMATES OR THE IMPACT OF SUBLEASE CONTRACTS.\nDURING THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2008, WE INCURRED SEVERANCE, FACILITY, AND OTHER RESTRUCTURING COSTS OF $110 MILLION RELATED TO THE Q408\nRESTRUCTURING PLAN OFFSET BY $18 MILLION RELATED TO STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION EXPENSE REVERSALS FOR UNVESTED STOCK AWARDS, RESULTING IN A NET RESTRUCTURING CHARGE OF $92 MILLION UNDER THE Q408 RESTRUCTURING PLAN.

OTHER CHARGES\nDECREASED BY $29 MILLION FOR THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2009, COMPARED TO 2008, PRIMARILY DUE TO FOREIGN EXCHANGE RE-MEASUREMENT OF ASSETS AND LIABILITIES DENOMINATED IN NON-FUNCTIONAL CURRENCIES.\nOTHER INCOME, NET MAY FLUCTUATE IN FUTURE PERIODS DUE TO CHANGES IN OUR AVERAGE INVESTMENT BALANCES, CHANGES IN INTEREST AND FOREIGN EXCHANGE RATES,\nREALIZED GAINS AND LOSSES ON INVESTMENTS, AND IMPAIRMENTS OF INVESTMENTS.\nINCOME TAXES.\nTHE PROVISION FOR INCOME TAXES FOR THE YEAR\nENDED DECEMBER 31, 2010 DIFFERS FROM THE AMOUNT COMPUTED BY APPLYING THE FEDERAL STATUTORY INCOME TAX RATE TO INCOME BEFORE PROVISION FOR INCOME TAXES AND EARNINGS IN EQUITY INTERESTS AS FOLLOWS (DOLLARS IN THOUSANDS).\nYEARS ENDED DECEMBER 31,\n2008\n(2)\n(1)\n2009\n(1)\n2010\n(1)\nINCOME TAX AT THE U.S. FEDERAL STATUTORY RATE OF 35 PERCENT\n$30,349\n35%\n$200,976\n35%\n$374,638\n35%\nSTATE INCOME TAXES, NET OF FEDERAL BENEFIT\n(8,925\n)\n(10\n)%\n(4,549\n)\n(1\n)%\n54,268\n5%\nCHANGE IN VALUATION ALLOWANCE\n25,674\n30%\n13,521\n2%\n(1,315\n)\n\u0097\nSTOCK-BASED COMPENSATION EXPENSE\n44,938\n52%\n28,322\n5%\n4,404\n\u0097\nRESEARCH TAX CREDITS\n(13,954\n)\n(16\n)%\n(11,046\n)\n(2\n)%\n(10,345\n)\n(1\n)%\nEFFECT OF NON-U.S. OPERATIONS\n18,403\n21%\n20,126\n4%\n(17,344\n)\n(2\n)%\nRESOLUTION WITH TAX AUTHORITIES\n(5,245\n)\n(6\n)%\n\u0097\n\u0097\n(159,168\n)\n(14\n)%\nTAX GAIN IN EXCESS OF BOOK GAIN FROM SALES OF ZIMBRA, INC.

THIS PRIMARILY OCCURS WITH REGARD TO OPTIONS GRANTED OUTSIDE THE U.S. THE 2010 EFFECTIVE TAX RATE INCREASE IS LOWER THAN IN PRIOR YEARS DUE TO RECENTLY GRANTED STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION AWARDS HAVING A LOWER GRANT\nDATE FAIR VALUE THAN STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION AWARDS FROM PRIOR YEARS. THAT EFFECT RESULTS IN A LOWER NON-DEDUCTIBLE EXPENSE FOR FINANCIAL STATEMENT PURPOSES AND A LOWER INCREASE TO OUR EFFECTIVE TAX RATE. ADDITIONALLY, IN 2010 THERE IS A LOWER\nEFFECTIVE TAX RATE IMPACT ASSOCIATED WITH NON-DEDUCTIBLE STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION AWARDS RELATED TO PRIOR YEAR ACQUISITIONS TO THE EXTENT SUCH AWARDS BECAME VESTED OR FORFEITED IN 2010.\n\u0095\nOUR EFFECTIVE TAX RATE IN ALL PERIODS IS THE RESULT OF THE MIX OF INCOME EARNED IN VARIOUS TAX JURISDICTIONS THAT APPLY A BROAD RANGE OF INCOME TAX\nRATES. OPERATING LOSSES IN SOME NON-U.S. JURISDICTIONS CANNOT BE USED TO OFFSET PROFITS AND THUS INCREASE THE OVERALL EFFECTIVE TAX RATE. THE IMPACT OF THOSE LOSSES IN 2010 WAS LOWER THAN IN PRIOR YEARS. ADDITIONALLY, IN 2010, WE BENEFITED FROM\nINCREASED PROFIT IN LOWER TAX JURISDICTIONS, PRIMARILY IN ASIA.\n\u0095\nIN 2010 WE HAD A FAVORABLE RESOLUTION OF CERTAIN ISSUES IN AN IRS EXAMINATION OF OUR 2005 AND 2006 U.S. FEDERAL INCOME TAX RETURNS RESULTING IN A\nREDUCTION OF RESERVES FOR TAX UNCERTAINTIES AND THE AVAILABILITY OF CAPITAL LOSS CARRYFORWARDS TO OFFSET THE TAX ON THE GAIN FROM THE SALES OF ZIMBRA, INC. AND HOTJOBS.\n\u0095\nDURING 2010, IN CONNECTION WITH TAX RESTRUCTURING ACTIVITIES, WE REACHED A FORMAL AGREEMENT WITH THE IRS THROUGH A PRE-FILING AGREEMENT TO TREAT\nCERTAIN INTERCOMPANY BAD DEBTS AS DEDUCTIBLE BUSINESS EXPENSES ON THE 2009 FEDERAL INCOME TAX RETURN.\nOUR GROSS AMOUNT OF\nUNRECOGNIZED TAX BENEFITS AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2010 IS $597 MILLION, OF WHICH $420 MILLION IS RECORDED ON THE CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS. THE AGREEMENTS REACHED IN 2010 WITH THE IRS RESULTED IN A REDUCTION TO OUR GROSS UNRECOGNIZED TAX BENEFITS\nOF $357 MILLION. OF THIS $357 MILLION REDUCTION IN UNRECOGNIZED TAX BENEFITS, $202 MILLION RESULTED IN AN EFFECTIVE TAX RATE BENEFIT. THE REDUCTION TO THE GROSS UNRECOGNIZED TAX BENEFITS HAS BEEN PARTIALLY OFFSET BY INCREASES FROM CURRENT YEAR TAX\nPOSITIONS. IN TOTAL, THE GROSS UNRECOGNIZED TAX BENEFITS AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2010 DECREASED BY $296 MILLION FROM THE RECORDED BALANCE AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2009.\nDURING THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2010, THE IRS COMPLETED ITS FIELD EXAMINATION OF OUR 2005 AND 2006 TAX RETURNS AND ISSUED NOTICES OF PROPOSED ADJUSTMENT. WE REACHED AN AGREEMENT WITH THE IRS IN\nCONNECTION WITH SEVERAL OF THE ADJUSTMENTS AND ADJUSTED OUR RESERVES ACCORDINGLY. THERE ARE OTHER PROPOSED ADJUSTMENTS, INCLUDING AN INTERCOMPANY TRANSFER PRICING MATTER WHICH COULD HAVE A SIGNIFICANT IMPACT ON OUR TAX LIABILITY IN FUTURE YEARS IF\nNOT RESOLVED FAVORABLY. WE HAVE NOT AGREED TO THESE OTHER PROPOSED ADJUSTMENTS AND ARE CONTESTING THEM THROUGH THE ADMINISTRATIVE PROCESS. IN THE THIRD QUARTER OF 2010, WE COMPLETED A FAST TRACK SETTLEMENT PROCESS WITH THE IRS RELATED TO CERTAIN\nCAPITAL LOSSES THAT BECAME AVAILABLE FOR USE. DURING THE FOURTH QUARTER OF 2010, WE REACHED A FORMAL AGREEMENT WITH THE IRS THROUGH A PRE-FILING AGREEMENT TO TREAT CERTAIN BAD DEBT EXPENSE AS A DEDUCTIBLE BUSINESS EXPENSE ON THE 2009 FEDERAL INCOME\nTAX RETURN. WE HAVE RECOGNIZED A BENEFIT IN 2010 FOR BOTH CAPITAL LOSS AND BAD DEBT EXPENSE AS A RESULT OF OUR RESOLUTION WITH THE IRS.\nDURING THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2010, THE IRS COMMENCED AN EXAMINATION OF OUR 2007 AND 2008 TAX RETURNS. WE ARE ALSO UNDER AUDIT BY THE\nCALIFORNIA FRANCHISE TAX BOARD FOR OUR 2005 AND 2006 TAX RETURNS. WE BELIEVE OUR EXISTING RESERVES FOR ALL TAX MATTERS ARE ADEQUATE. WE ALSO FILED WITH THE IRS AMENDED FEDERAL TAX RETURNS FOR OUR FISCAL YEARS 2000 TO 2008, TO ELECT FOREIGN TAX\nCREDITS FOR FOREIGN TAXES PAID VERSUS THE PREVIOUS ELECTION TO DEDUCT FOREIGN TAXES FROM TAXABLE INCOME, REDUCING INCOME TAXES PAYABLE BY $102 MILLION. OUR TAX PROVISIONS FOR ALL YEARS HAD BEEN COMPUTED ON THE BASIS OF FOREIGN TAX CREDITS, AND\nDIFFERENCES BETWEEN BOOK AND\n44\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nTAX TREATMENT WERE CHARGED TO ADDITIONAL PAID-IN CAPITAL DUE TO THE INTERACTION OF STOCK OPTION DEDUCTIONS AND THE FOREIGN TAX CREDIT COMPUTATIONS. ACCORDINGLY, THE $102 MILLION WAS RECORDED AS A\nCREDIT TO ADDITIONAL PAID-IN CAPITAL WITH A CORRESPONDING REDUCTION OF $49 MILLION IN CURRENT YEAR INCOME TAXES PAYABLE AND A $53 MILLION RECEIVABLE FROM THE IRS FOR TAXES PAID IN PRIOR YEARS.\nEARNINGS IN EQUITY INTERESTS.\nEARNINGS IN EQUITY INTERESTS FOR THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2010 WERE APPROXIMATELY $396 MILLION, COMPARED TO\n$250 MILLION AND $597 MILLION FOR 2009 AND 2008, RESPECTIVELY. EARNINGS IN EQUITY INTERESTS INCREASED DURING THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2010 COMPARED TO 2009 DUE PRIMARILY TO YAHOO JAPAN\u0092S IMPROVED FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE AND THE IMPACT OF\nFOREIGN CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATE FLUCTUATIONS. EARNINGS IN EQUITY INTERESTS FOR THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2008 INCLUDED A $401 MILLION NON-CASH GAIN RELATED TO ALIBABA GROUP\u0092S IPO OF ALIBABA.COM, NET OF TAX. IN CONNECTION WITH THE\nIPO, WE MADE A DIRECT INVESTMENT OF 1 PERCENT IN ALIBABA.COM, WHICH WE SOLD DURING THE THIRD QUARTER OF 2009 FOR NET PROCEEDS OF $145 MILLION. IN 2008, WE ALSO RECORDED AN IMPAIRMENT CHARGE OF $30 MILLION, NET OF TAX, WITHIN EARNINGS IN EQUITY\nINTERESTS TO REDUCE THE CARRYING VALUE OF THE ALIBABA.COM INVESTMENT TO FAIR VALUE. SEE NOTE 4\u0097\u0093INVESTMENTS IN EQUITY INTERESTS\u0094 IN THE NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR ADDITIONAL INFORMATION.\nNONCONTROLLING INTERESTS.\nNONCONTROLLING INTERESTS REPRESENT THE NONCONTROLLING HOLDERS\u0092 PERCENTAGE SHARE OF INCOME OR LOSSES FROM THE\nSUBSIDIARIES IN WHICH WE HOLD A MAJORITY, BUT LESS THAN 100 PERCENT, OWNERSHIP INTEREST AND THE RESULTS OF WHICH ARE CONSOLIDATED IN OUR CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS. NONCONTROLLING INTERESTS WERE APPROXIMATELY $13 MILLION IN 2010,\nCOMPARED TO $7 MILLION AND $6 MILLION IN 2009 AND 2008, RESPECTIVELY. NONCONTROLLING INTERESTS RECORDED IN 2010, 2009, AND 2008, WERE MAINLY RELATED TO OUR YAHOO! 7 JOINT VENTURE IN AUSTRALIA.\nBUSINESS SEGMENT RESULTS\nWE MANAGE OUR\nBUSINESS GEOGRAPHICALLY. THROUGH THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2010, THE PRIMARY AREAS OF MEASUREMENT AND DECISION-MAKING WERE THE U.S. AND INTERNATIONAL. BEGINNING IN THE SECOND QUARTER OF 2010, OUR BUSINESS MANAGEMENT STRUCTURE WAS REDEFINED ALONG THREE\nGEOGRAPHIES: AMERICAS, EMEA (EUROPE, MIDDLE EAST, AND AFRICA) AND ASIA PACIFIC. AS A RESULT, PRIOR PERIOD PRESENTATIONS HAVE BEEN UPDATED TO CONFORM TO THE SEGMENTS CURRENTLY BEING USED BY OUR MANAGEMENT TEAM TO EVALUATE OUR OPERATIONAL PERFORMANCE.\nIN OUR ANNUAL REPORT ON FORM 10-K FOR THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2009, THE SEGMENT PROFITABILITY MEASURE WE REPORTED WAS SEGMENT\nOPERATING INCOME BEFORE DEPRECIATION, AMORTIZATION, AND STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION EXPENSE. OUR MANAGEMENT TEAM NO LONGER USES THIS MEASURE TO EVALUATE THE OPERATIONAL PERFORMANCE OF OUR SEGMENTS. BEGINNING IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2010, MANAGEMENT\nBEGAN TO RELY ON AN INTERNAL REPORTING PROCESS THAT PROVIDED REVENUE AND DIRECT COSTS BY SEGMENT AND CONSOLIDATED INCOME FROM OPERATIONS FOR MAKING DECISIONS RELATED TO THE EVALUATION OF THE FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE OF, AND ALLOCATING RESOURCES TO, OUR\nSEGMENTS. BEGINNING IN THE FOURTH QUARTER OF 2010, MANAGEMENT BEGAN TO RELY ON AN INTERNAL REPORTING PROCESS THAT PROVIDES REVENUE EX-TAC, WHICH IS DEFINED AS REVENUE LESS TAC, DIRECT COSTS EXCLUDING TAC BY SEGMENT, AND CONSOLIDATED INCOME FROM\nOPERATIONS FOR MAKING DECISIONS RELATED TO THE EVALUATION OF THE FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE OF, AND ALLOCATING RESOURCES TO, OUR SEGMENTS. AS A RESULT, PRIOR PERIOD PRESENTATIONS HAVE BEEN UPDATED TO CONFORM TO THE CURRENT PROFITABILITY MEASURES BEING\nUSED BY OUR MANAGEMENT TEAM TO EVALUATE THE FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE OF OUR SEGMENTS.\n45\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nSUMMARIZED INFORMATION BY SEGMENT WAS AS FOLLOWS (DOLLARS IN THOUSANDS).\nYEARS ENDED DECEMBER 31,\n2008-2009% CHANGE\n2009-2010% CHANGE\n2008\n2009\n2010\nREVENUE BY SEGMENT.\nAMERICAS\n$5,319,617\n$4,852,331\n$4,425,457\n(9\n)%\n(9\n)%\nEMEA\n863,544\n598,300\n579,145\n(31\n)%\n(3\n)%\nASIA PACIFIC\n1,025,341\n1,009,684\n1,320,049\n(2\n)%\n31%\nTOTAL REVENUE\n7,208,502\n6,460,315\n6,324,651\n(10\n)%\n(2\n)%\nTAC BY SEGMENT.\nAMERICAS\n1,140,868\n1,195,579\n957,607\n5%\n(20\n)%\nEMEA\n278,324\n207,844\n210,261\n(25\n)%\n1%\nASIA PACIFIC\n390,722\n374,403\n568,554\n(4\n)%\n52%\nTOTAL TAC\n1,809,914\n1,777,826\n1,736,422\n(2\n)%\n(2\n)%\nREVENUE EX-TAC BY SEGMENT.\nAMERICAS\n4,178,749\n3,656,752\n3,467,850\n(12\n)%\n(5\n)%\nEMEA\n585,220\n390,456\n368,884\n(33\n)%\n(6\n)%\nASIA PACIFIC\n634,619\n635,281\n751,495\n0%\n18%\nTOTAL REVENUE EX-TAC\n5,398,588\n4,682,489\n4,588,229\n(13\n)%\n(2\n)%\nDIRECT COSTS BY SEGMENT\n(1)\n.\nAMERICAS\n918,229\n620,690\n568,017\n(32\n)%\n(8\n)%\nEMEA\n211,364\n115,778\n118,954\n(45\n)%\n3%\nASIA PACIFIC\n166,605\n138,739\n146,657\n(17\n)%\n6%\nGLOBAL OPERATING COSTS\n(2)(3)\n2,267,160\n2,116,747\n2,044,246\n(7\n)%\n(3\n)%\nRESTRUCTURING CHARGES, NET\n106,854\n126,901\n57,957\n19%\n(54\n)%\nDEPRECIATION AND AMORTIZATION\n790,033\n738,855\n656,396\n(6\n)%\n(11\n)%\nSTOCK-BASED COMPENSATION EXPENSE\n437,843\n438,087\n223,478\n0%\n(49\n)%\nGOODWILL IMPAIRMENT CHARGE\n487,537\n\u0097\n\u0097\nN\/M\n(4)\n\u0097\nINCOME FROM OPERATIONS\n$12,963\n$386,692\n$772,524\nN\/M\n(4)\n100%\n(1)\nDIRECT COSTS FOR EACH SEGMENT INCLUDE COST OF REVENUE (EXCLUDING TAC) AND OTHER OPERATING EXPENSES THAT ARE DIRECTLY ATTRIBUTABLE TO THE SEGMENT SUCH\nAS EMPLOYEE COMPENSATION EXPENSE (EXCLUDING STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION EXPENSE), LOCAL SALES AND MARKETING EXPENSES, AND FACILITIES EXPENSES.

SEARCH ADVERTISING REVENUE EX-TAC DECREASED\nDUE TO THE REVENUE SHARE WITH MICROSOFT ASSOCIATED WITH THE SEARCH AGREEMENT AND THE IMPACT OF DISCONTINUING OUR PAID INCLUSION SEARCH PRODUCT IN LATE 2009 AS PART OF OUR ADVERTISING QUALITY INITIATIVES. THESE DECREASES WERE OFFSET BY AN INCREASE IN\nDISPLAY REVENUE EX-TAC DRIVEN\n46\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nBY INCREASED ADVERTISING SPENDING AND A SHIFT TOWARDS HIGHER-YIELDING DISPLAY INVENTORY BY OUR CUSTOMERS. FOR THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2010, DIRECT COSTS ATTRIBUTABLE TO THE AMERICAS\nSEGMENT DECREASED $53 MILLION, OR 8 PERCENT, COMPARED TO 2009. THE DECREASE IS PRIMARILY DUE TO LOWER COSTS FOR OTHER COSTS OF REVENUE INCLUDING CREDIT CARD COSTS AND CONTENT COSTS.\nAMERICAS REVENUE EX-TAC FOR THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2009 DECREASED $522 MILLION, OR 12 PERCENT, COMPARED TO 2008. OUR YEAR-OVER-YEAR DECREASE IN REVENUE EX-TAC WAS A RESULT OF A DECLINE IN\nADVERTISING REVENUE EX-TAC ACROSS THE MAJORITY OF YAHOO!

FOR THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2009, DIRECT COSTS ATTRIBUTABLE TO THE AMERICAS\nSEGMENT DECREASED $298 MILLION, OR 32 PERCENT, COMPARED TO 2008. THE DECLINE IS PRIMARILY DUE TO DECREASES IN COMPENSATION COSTS DUE TO A LOWER AVERAGE HEADCOUNT AS A RESULT OF OUR COST REDUCTION INITIATIVES AS WELL AS DECREASES IN MARKETING\nEXPENSES.\nREVENUE EX-TAC IN THE AMERICAS ACCOUNTED FOR APPROXIMATELY 76 PERCENT OF TOTAL REVENUE EX-TAC FOR THE YEAR ENDED\nDECEMBER 31, 2010, COMPARED TO 78 PERCENT AND 77 PERCENT IN 2009 AND 2008, RESPECTIVELY.\nEMEA.\nEMEA REVENUE EX-TAC\nFOR THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2010 DECREASED $22 MILLION, OR 6 PERCENT, COMPARED TO 2009.

FOR THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2010, DIRECT COSTS ATTRIBUTABLE TO THE EMEA SEGMENT INCREASED $3 MILLION, OR 3 PERCENT, COMPARED TO 2009.

FOR THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2009, DIRECT COSTS ATTRIBUTABLE TO THE EMEA SEGMENT DECREASED $96 MILLION, OR 45 PERCENT, COMPARED TO 2008. THE DECLINE IS PRIMARILY DUE TO DECREASES IN\nCOMPENSATION COSTS DUE TO A LOWER AVERAGE HEADCOUNT AS A RESULT OF OUR COST REDUCTION INITIATIVES AS WELL AS DECREASES IN MARKETING EXPENSES.\nREVENUE EX-TAC IN EMEA ACCOUNTED FOR APPROXIMATELY 8 PERCENT OF TOTAL REVENUE EX-TAC FOR THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2010, COMPARED TO 8\nPERCENT AND 11 PERCENT IN 2009 AND 2008, RESPECTIVELY.\nASIA PACIFIC.\nASIA PACIFIC REVENUE EX-TAC FOR THE YEAR ENDED\nDECEMBER 31, 2010 INCREASED $116 MILLION, OR 18 PERCENT, COMPARED TO 2009.

FOR THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2010, DIRECT COSTS ATTRIBUTABLE TO THE ASIA PACIFIC SEGMENT INCREASED $8 MILLION, OR 6 PERCENT, COMPARED TO 2009. THE INCREASE IS PRIMARILY DUE TO\nCOMPENSATION COSTS DRIVEN BY HIGHER AVERAGE HEADCOUNT AS WELL AS INCREASED CONTENT COSTS.\nASIA PACIFIC REVENUE EX-TAC FOR THE YEAR ENDED\nDECEMBER 31, 2009 REMAINED FLAT COMPARED TO 2008. FEES REVENUE INCREASED YEAR-OVER-YEAR, BUT WAS OFFSET BY A DECLINE IN OUR SEARCH AND DISPLAY ADVERTISING BUSINESSES. THE INCREASE IN FEES REVENUE WAS DUE TO INCREASED BUSINESS AS A RESULT OF OUR\nACQUISITIONS IN THE ASIA PACIFIC REGION DURING THE THIRD QUARTER OF 2008. FOR THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2009, DIRECT COSTS ATTRIBUTABLE TO THE ASIA PACIFIC SEGMENT DECREASED $28 MILLION, OR 17 PERCENT, COMPARED TO 2008.

DURING THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2010, WE REPURCHASED 119 MILLION SHARES FOR $1,749 MILLION.\nDURING THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2010, WE GENERATED $1,240 MILLION OF CASH FROM OPERATING ACTIVITIES, NET PROCEEDS FROM SALES AND MATURITIES OF\nMARKETABLE DEBT SECURITIES OF $1,097 MILLION, PROCEEDS FROM THE SALES OF DIVESTED BUSINESSES OF $325 MILLION, AND $167 MILLION FROM THE ISSUANCE OF COMMON STOCK AS A RESULT OF THE EXERCISE OF EMPLOYEE STOCK OPTIONS AND EMPLOYEE STOCK PURCHASES.\nTHIS WAS OFFSET BY A NET $714 MILLION IN CAPITAL EXPENDITURES, A NET $157 MILLION FOR ACQUISITIONS, $1,749 MILLION USED IN THE DIRECT REPURCHASE OF COMMON STOCK, AND $49 MILLION IN TAX WITHHOLDING PAYMENTS RELATED TO NET SHARE SETTLEMENTS OF\nRESTRICTED STOCK UNITS AND TAX WITHHOLDING-RELATED REACQUISITION OF SHARES OF RESTRICTED STOCK.\nDURING THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2009,\nWE INVESTED $113 MILLION IN DIRECT STOCK REPURCHASES, A NET $434 MILLION IN CAPITAL EXPENDITURES, AND A NET $195 MILLION IN ACQUISITIONS. THE CASH USED FOR THESE INVESTMENTS WAS OFFSET BY $1.3 BILLION OF CASH GENERATED FROM OPERATING ACTIVITIES,\n$265 MILLION OF PROCEEDS FROM SALES OF MARKETABLE EQUITY SECURITIES, AND $113 MILLION FROM THE ISSUANCE OF COMMON STOCK AS A RESULT OF THE EXERCISE OF EMPLOYEE STOCK OPTIONS. IN 2009, $73 MILLION WAS USED FOR TAX WITHHOLDING PAYMENTS RELATED TO THE\nNET SHARE SETTLEMENT OF RESTRICTED STOCK UNITS AND TAX WITHHOLDING-RELATED REACQUISITION OF SHARES OF RESTRICTED STOCK.\nWE HAVE ACCRUED U.S.\nFEDERAL INCOME TAXES ON THE EARNINGS OF OUR FOREIGN SUBSIDIARIES EXCEPT TO THE EXTENT THE EARNINGS ARE CONSIDERED INDEFINITELY REINVESTED OUTSIDE THE U.S. AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2010, APPROXIMATELY $2.6 BILLION OF EARNINGS HELD BY OUR FOREIGN\nSUBSIDIARIES AND A CORPORATE JOINT VENTURE ARE DESIGNATED AS INDEFINITELY REINVESTED OUTSIDE THE U.S. IF REQUIRED FOR OUR OPERATIONS IN THE U.S., MOST OF THE CASH HELD ABROAD COULD BE REPATRIATED TO THE U.S. BUT, UNDER CURRENT LAW, WOULD BE SUBJECT\nTO U.S. FEDERAL INCOME TAXES (SUBJECT TO AN ADJUSTMENT FOR FOREIGN TAX CREDITS). CURRENTLY, WE DO NOT ANTICIPATE A NEED TO REPATRIATE THESE FUNDS TO OUR U.S. OPERATIONS.\nWE INVEST EXCESS CASH PREDOMINANTLY IN MARKETABLE DEBT SECURITIES, MONEY MARKET FUNDS, AND TIME DEPOSITS THAT ARE LIQUID, HIGHLY RATED, AND THE MAJORITY OF WHICH HAVE EFFECTIVE MATURITIES OF LESS THAN ONE\nYEAR. OUR MARKETABLE DEBT AND EQUITY SECURITIES ARE CLASSIFIED AS AVAILABLE-FOR-SALE AND ARE REPORTED AT FAIR VALUE, WITH UNREALIZED GAINS AND LOSSES, NET OF TAX, RECORDED IN ACCUMULATED OTHER COMPREHENSIVE INCOME. REALIZED GAINS OR LOSSES AND\nDECLINES IN VALUE JUDGED TO BE OTHER-THAN-TEMPORARY, IF ANY, ON AVAILABLE-FOR-SALE SECURITIES ARE REPORTED IN OTHER INCOME, NET. THE FAIR VALUE FOR SECURITIES IS DETERMINED BASED ON QUOTED MARKET PRICES OF THE HISTORICAL UNDERLYING SECURITY OR FROM\nREADILY AVAILABLE PRICING SOURCES FOR THE IDENTICAL UNDERLYING SECURITIES THAT MAY NOT BE ACTIVELY TRADED AS OF THE VALUATION DATE. AS OF\n49\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nDECEMBER 31, 2010, CERTAIN OF OUR MARKETABLE DEBT SECURITIES HAD A FAIR VALUE BELOW COST DUE PRIMARILY TO THE CHANGES IN MARKET RATES OF INTEREST AND YIELDS ON THESE SECURITIES. WE EVALUATE\nTHESE INVESTMENTS PERIODICALLY FOR POSSIBLE OTHER-THAN-TEMPORARY IMPAIRMENT. WE HAVE NO CURRENT REQUIREMENT OR INTENT TO SELL THESE SECURITIES. WE EXPECT TO RECOVER UP TO (OR BEYOND) THE INITIAL COST OF THE INVESTMENT.\nWE EXPECT TO CONTINUE TO GENERATE POSITIVE CASH FLOW FROM OPERATIONS FOR THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2011. WE USE CASH GENERATED BY OPERATIONS AS OUR PRIMARY\nSOURCE OF LIQUIDITY BECAUSE WE BELIEVE THAT INTERNALLY GENERATED CASH FLOWS ARE SUFFICIENT TO SUPPORT OUR BUSINESS OPERATIONS AND CAPITAL EXPENDITURES. WE BELIEVE THAT EXISTING CASH, CASH EQUIVALENTS, AND INVESTMENTS IN MARKETABLE DEBT SECURITIES,\nTOGETHER WITH ANY CASH GENERATED FROM OPERATIONS WILL BE SUFFICIENT TO MEET NORMAL OPERATING REQUIREMENTS INCLUDING CAPITAL EXPENDITURES FOR THE NEXT TWELVE MONTHS. HOWEVER, WE MAY SELL ADDITIONAL EQUITY, OR DEBT SECURITIES, OR OBTAIN CREDIT\nFACILITIES TO FURTHER ENHANCE OUR LIQUIDITY POSITION, AND THE SALE OF ADDITIONAL EQUITY SECURITIES COULD RESULT IN DILUTION TO OUR STOCKHOLDERS.\nSEE NOTE 8\u0097\u0093INVESTMENTS\u0094 IN THE NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR ADDITIONAL INFORMATION.\nCASH FLOW CHANGES\nCASH PROVIDED BY OPERATING ACTIVITIES IS DRIVEN BY OUR NET\nINCOME, ADJUSTED FOR NON-CASH ITEMS, WORKING CAPITAL CHANGES, DIVIDENDS RECEIVED FROM EQUITY INVESTEES, AND NON-OPERATING GAINS FROM SALES OF INVESTMENTS, ASSETS AND OTHER. NON-CASH ADJUSTMENTS INCLUDE DEPRECIATION, AMORTIZATION OF INTANGIBLE\nASSETS, STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION EXPENSE, NON-CASH RESTRUCTURING CHARGES, TAX BENEFITS FROM STOCK-BASED AWARDS, EXCESS TAX BENEFITS FROM STOCK-BASED AWARDS, DEFERRED INCOME TAXES, AND EARNINGS IN EQUITY INTERESTS. CASH PROVIDED BY OPERATING\nACTIVITIES WAS SLIGHTLY LOWER THAN NET INCOME IN THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2010 DUE TO NON-CASH ITEMS INCLUDED IN NET INCOME AND CHANGES IN WORKING CAPITAL, INCLUDING LOWER COLLECTIONS ON ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE, HIGHER TAX PAYMENTS MADE, AND\nMICROSOFT REIMBURSEMENTS NOT YET RECEIVED AS CASH. AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2010, WE HAD INCURRED A TOTAL OF $414 MILLION OF REIMBURSABLE EXPENSES (INCLUDING $43 MILLION RELATED TO 2009) IN CONNECTION WITH THE SEARCH AGREEMENT. OF THAT AMOUNT, $350\nMILLION HAD BEEN RECEIVED FROM MICROSOFT, AND $64 MILLION WAS CLASSIFIED AS PART OF PREPAID EXPENSES AND OTHER CURRENT ASSETS ON OUR CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS. CASH PROVIDED BY OPERATING ACTIVITIES WAS GREATER THAN NET INCOME IN 2009 MAINLY DUE TO\nTHE NET IMPACT OF NON-CASH ADJUSTMENTS TO INCOME. IN THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2008, OPERATING CASH FLOWS WERE POSITIVELY IMPACTED BY CHANGES IN WORKING CAPITAL BALANCES, INCLUDING A ONE-TIME PAYMENT FROM AT&T INC.\nCASH USED IN INVESTING ACTIVITIES IS PRIMARILY ATTRIBUTABLE TO CAPITAL EXPENDITURES, PURCHASES, SALES AND MATURITIES OF MARKETABLE DEBT SECURITIES,\nPURCHASES OF INTANGIBLE ASSETS, AS WELL AS ACQUISITIONS INCLUDING OUR STRATEGIC INVESTMENTS. OUR CAPITAL EXPENDITURES TOTALED $714 MILLION IN 2010, $434 MILLION IN 2009, AND $675 MILLION IN 2008. OUR CAPITAL EXPENDITURES HAVE BEEN PRIMARILY USED FOR\nPURCHASES AND INTERNAL DEVELOPMENT OF SOFTWARE TO SUPPORT OUR OFFERINGS AND OUR INCREASED NUMBER OF USERS. WE INVESTED A NET $157 MILLION IN ACQUISITIONS IN 2010, COMPARED TO $195 MILLION AND $209 MILLION IN 2009 AND 2008, RESPECTIVELY. ACQUISITIONS\nAND INVESTMENTS IN 2009 INCLUDED THE CASH OUTLAY FOR OUR ACQUISITION OF MAKTOOB. ACQUISITIONS AND INVESTMENTS IN 2008 INCLUDED THE CASH OUTLAY FOR OUR ACQUISITION OF MAVEN. IN 2010, WE RECEIVED NET PROCEEDS FROM SALES, MATURITIES, AND PURCHASES OF\nMARKETABLE DEBT SECURITIES OF $1,097 MILLION. IN 2009 AND 2008, WE UTILIZED $2,027 MILLION AND $368 MILLION, RESPECTIVELY, FOR NET PURCHASES OF MARKETABLE DEBT SECURITIES. IN 2010, WE RECEIVED NET PROCEEDS FROM THE SALES OF DIVESTED BUSINESSES OF\n$325 MILLION FOR WHICH THERE WERE NO SIMILAR TRANSACTIONS IN 2009 AND 2008. IN 2009, WE ALSO RECEIVED PROCEEDS OF $265 MILLION FROM THE SALES OF MARKETABLE EQUITY SECURITIES.\nCASH USED IN FINANCING ACTIVITIES IS DRIVEN BY STOCK REPURCHASES OFFSET BY EMPLOYEE STOCK OPTION EXERCISES AND EMPLOYEE STOCK PURCHASES. OUR CASH PROCEEDS FROM EMPLOYEE OPTION EXERCISES AND EMPLOYEE STOCK\nPURCHASES WERE $167 MILLION IN 2010, COMPARED TO $113 MILLION AND $363 MILLION IN 2009 AND 2008, RESPECTIVELY.\nDURING THE YEAR ENDED\nDECEMBER 31, 2010, WE USED $1,749 MILLION IN THE DIRECT REPURCHASE OF 119 MILLION SHARES OF COMMON STOCK AT AN AVERAGE PRICE OF $14.68 PER SHARE AND $49 MILLION FOR TAX WITHHOLDING PAYMENTS RELATED TO NET SHARE SETTLEMENTS OF\nRESTRICTED STOCK UNITS AND TAX WITHHOLDING-RELATED REACQUISITION OF SHARES OF RESTRICTED\n50\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nSTOCK. DURING THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2009, WE USED $113 MILLION IN THE DIRECT REPURCHASE OF 7 MILLION SHARES OF COMMON STOCK AT AN AVERAGE PRICE OF $15.31 PER SHARE AND $73 MILLION\nFOR TAX WITHHOLDING PAYMENTS RELATED TO NET SHARE SETTLEMENTS OF RESTRICTED STOCK UNITS AND TAX WITHHOLDING-RELATED REACQUISITION OF SHARES OF RESTRICTED STOCK. DURING THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2008, WE USED $79 MILLION IN THE DIRECT\nREPURCHASE OF 3 MILLION SHARES OF COMMON STOCK AT AN AVERAGE PRICE OF $23.39 PER SHARE AND $77 MILLION FOR TAX WITHHOLDING PAYMENTS RELATED TO NET SHARE SETTLEMENTS OF RESTRICTED STOCK UNITS AND TAX WITHHOLDING-RELATED REACQUISITION OF SHARES\nOF RESTRICTED STOCK.\nIN 2010, 2009, AND 2008, $131 MILLION, $108 MILLION, AND $125 MILLION, RESPECTIVELY, OF EXCESS TAX BENEFITS FROM\nSTOCK-BASED AWARDS FOR OPTIONS EXERCISED IN CURRENT AND PRIOR PERIODS WERE INCLUDED AS A SOURCE OF CASH FLOWS FROM FINANCING ACTIVITIES. THESE EXCESS TAX BENEFITS REPRESENT THE REDUCTION IN INCOME TAXES OTHERWISE PAYABLE DURING THE PERIOD,\nATTRIBUTABLE TO THE ACTUAL GROSS TAX BENEFITS IN EXCESS OF THE EXPECTED TAX BENEFITS FOR OPTIONS EXERCISED IN CURRENT AND PRIOR PERIODS. WE HAVE ACCUMULATED EXCESS TAX DEDUCTIONS RELATING TO STOCK OPTIONS EXERCISED PRIOR TO JANUARY 1, 2006\nAVAILABLE TO REDUCE INCOME TAXES OTHERWISE PAYABLE. TO THE EXTENT SUCH DEDUCTIONS REDUCE INCOME TAXES PAYABLE IN THE CURRENT YEAR, THEY ARE REPORTED AS FINANCING ACTIVITIES IN THE CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF CASH FLOWS. SEE\nNOTE 11\u0097\u0093EMPLOYEE BENEFITS\u0094 IN THE NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR ADDITIONAL INFORMATION.\nSTOCK\nREPURCHASES\nIN OCTOBER 2006, OUR BOARD OF DIRECTORS AUTHORIZED A STOCK REPURCHASE PROGRAM FOR US TO REPURCHASE UP TO $3 BILLION OF OUR\nOUTSTANDING SHARES OF COMMON STOCK FROM TIME TO TIME OVER THE NEXT FIVE YEARS FROM THE DATE OF AUTHORIZATION, DEPENDENT ON MARKET CONDITIONS, STOCK PRICE, AND OTHER FACTORS. WE REPURCHASE OUR COMMON STOCK, FROM TIME TO TIME, IN PART TO REDUCE THE\nDILUTIVE EFFECTS OF OUR STOCK OPTIONS, AWARDS, AND EMPLOYEE STOCK PURCHASE PLAN. REPURCHASES MAY TAKE PLACE IN THE OPEN MARKET OR IN PRIVATELY NEGOTIATED TRANSACTIONS, INCLUDING DERIVATIVE TRANSACTIONS, AND MAY BE MADE UNDER A RULE 10B5-1 PLAN.\nON JUNE 24, 2010, OUR BOARD OF DIRECTORS APPROVED A NEW STOCK REPURCHASE PROGRAM. UNDER THE NEW PROGRAM, WHICH EXPIRES IN JUNE 2013, WE\nARE AUTHORIZED TO REPURCHASE UP TO $3 BILLION OF OUR OUTSTANDING SHARES OF COMMON STOCK FROM TIME TO TIME. THE REPURCHASES MAY TAKE PLACE IN THE OPEN MARKET OR IN PRIVATELY NEGOTIATED TRANSACTIONS, INCLUDING DERIVATIVE TRANSACTIONS, AND MAY BE MADE\nUNDER A RULE 10B5-1 PLAN.\nDURING THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2010, 63 MILLION SHARES WERE REPURCHASED UNDER THE OCTOBER 2006\nPROGRAM FOR A TOTAL OF $973 MILLION, WHICH EXHAUSTED THE REPURCHASE AUTHORIZATION OF THE OCTOBER 2006 PROGRAM, AND 56 MILLION SHARES WERE REPURCHASED UNDER THE JUNE 2010 PROGRAM FOR A TOTAL OF $776 MILLION, RESULTING IN AGGREGATE REPURCHASES\nDURING THE PERIOD OF 119 MILLION SHARES FOR A TOTAL OF $1,749 MILLION AT AN AVERAGE PRICE OF $14.68 PER SHARE. AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2010, THE JUNE 2010 PROGRAM HAD REMAINING AUTHORIZED PURCHASE CAPACITY OF $2,224 MILLION.\nAS OF DECEMBER 31, 2010, WE HAVE REPURCHASED AND RETIRED 335 MILLION SHARES, RESULTING IN REDUCTIONS OF $0.3 MILLION IN COMMON STOCK, $2.5\nBILLION IN ADDITIONAL PAID-IN CAPITAL, AND $4.6 BILLION IN RETAINED EARNINGS. TREASURY STOCK IS ACCOUNTED FOR UNDER THE COST METHOD.\nCAPITAL EXPENDITURES\nCAPITAL\nEXPENDITURES ARE GENERALLY COMPRISED OF PURCHASES OF COMPUTER HARDWARE, SOFTWARE, SERVER EQUIPMENT, FURNITURE AND FIXTURES, AND REAL ESTATE. CAPITAL EXPENDITURES, NET WERE $714 MILLION IN 2010, COMPARED TO $434 MILLION IN 2009 AND $675 MILLION IN\n2008. OUR CAPITAL EXPENDITURES IN 2011 ARE EXPECTED TO BE LOWER COMPARED TO 2010 DUE IN PART TO HIGHER INFRASTRUCTURE COSTS IN 2010 IN CONNECTION WITH OUR INITIATIVES TO BUILD OUT OUR OWNED AND OPERATED DATA CENTERS.\n51\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nCONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS AND COMMITMENTS\nTHE FOLLOWING TABLE PRESENTS CERTAIN PAYMENTS DUE UNDER CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS WITH MINIMUM FIRM COMMITMENTS AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2010 (IN MILLIONS).\nPAYMENTS DUE BY PERIOD\nTOTAL\nDUE IN\n2011\nDUE IN\n2012-2013\nDUE IN\n2014-2015\nTHEREAFTER\nOPERATING LEASE OBLIGATIONS\n(1)\n$641\n$165\n$247\n$159\n$70\nCAPITAL LEASE OBLIGATION\n(2)\n68\n7\n15\n16\n30\nAFFILIATE COMMITMENTS\n(3)\n95\n86\n9\n\u0097\n\u0097\nNON-CANCELABLE OBLIGATIONS\n(4)\n191\n95\n67\n7\n22\nUNCERTAIN TAX POSITIONS, INCLUDING INTEREST AND PENALTIES\n(5)\n420\n112\n\u0097\n\u0097\n308\nTOTAL CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS\n$1,415\n$465\n$338\n$182\n$430\n(1)\nWE HAVE ENTERED INTO VARIOUS NON-CANCELABLE OPERATING LEASE AGREEMENTS FOR OUR OFFICES THROUGHOUT THE AMERICAS, EMEA, AND ASIA PACIFIC REGIONS WITH\nORIGINAL LEASE PERIODS UP TO 13 YEARS, EXPIRING BETWEEN 2010 AND 2019. SEE NOTE 12\u0097\u0093COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES\u0094 IN THE NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR ADDITIONAL INFORMATION.\n(2)\nDURING THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2008, WE ENTERED INTO AN 11 YEAR LEASE AGREEMENT FOR A DATA CENTER IN THE WESTERN U.S. OF THE TOTAL\nEXPECTED MINIMUM LEASE COMMITMENT OF $105 MILLION, $21 MILLION WAS CLASSIFIED AS AN OPERATING LEASE FOR REAL ESTATE AND $84 MILLION WAS CLASSIFIED AS A CAPITAL LEASE FOR EQUIPMENT.\n(3)\nWE ARE OBLIGATED TO MAKE MINIMUM PAYMENTS UNDER CONTRACTS TO PROVIDE SPONSORED SEARCH AND\/OR DISPLAY ADVERTISING SERVICES TO OUR AFFILIATES, WHICH\nREPRESENT TAC.\n(4)\nWE ARE OBLIGATED TO MAKE PAYMENTS UNDER VARIOUS ARRANGEMENTS WITH VENDORS AND OTHER BUSINESS PARTNERS, PRINCIPALLY FOR MARKETING, BANDWIDTH, AND\nCONTENT ARRANGEMENTS.\n(5)\nAS OF DECEMBER 31, 2010, UNRECOGNIZED TAX BENEFITS AND POTENTIAL INTEREST AND PENALTIES RESULTED IN ACCRUED LIABILITIES OF $420 MILLION, OF WHICH\n$112 MILLION IS CLASSIFIED AS ACCRUED EXPENSES AND OTHER CURRENT LIABILITIES AND $308 MILLION IS CLASSIFIED AS DEFERRED AND OTHER LONG-TERM TAX LIABILITIES, NET ON OUR CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS. AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2010, THE SETTLEMENT PERIOD\nFOR THE $308 MILLION LONG-TERM INCOME TAX LIABILITIES CANNOT BE DETERMINED; HOWEVER, THE LIABILITIES ARE NOT EXPECTED TO BECOME DUE WITHIN THE NEXT TWELVE MONTHS.\nINTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS.\nWE ARE COMMITTED TO MAKE CERTAIN PAYMENTS UNDER VARIOUS INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY ARRANGEMENTS OF UP TO $37 MILLION THROUGH 2023.\nOTHER COMMITMENTS AND OFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS.\nIN THE ORDINARY COURSE OF BUSINESS, WE MAY PROVIDE INDEMNIFICATIONS OF VARYING SCOPE AND\nTERMS TO CUSTOMERS, VENDORS, LESSORS, JOINT VENTURE AND BUSINESS PARTNERS, PURCHASERS OF ASSETS OR SUBSIDIARIES AND OTHER PARTIES WITH RESPECT TO CERTAIN MATTERS, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, LOSSES ARISING OUT OF OUR BREACH OF AGREEMENTS OR\nREPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES MADE BY US, SERVICES TO BE PROVIDED BY US, INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY INFRINGEMENT CLAIMS MADE BY THIRD PARTIES OR, WITH RESPECT TO THE SALE OF ASSETS OR A SUBSIDIARY, MATTERS RELATED TO OUR CONDUCT OF THE BUSINESS AND TAX\nMATTERS PRIOR TO THE SALE. IN ADDITION, WE HAVE ENTERED INTO INDEMNIFICATION AGREEMENTS WITH OUR DIRECTORS AND CERTAIN OF OUR OFFICERS THAT WILL REQUIRE US, AMONG OTHER THINGS, TO INDEMNIFY THEM AGAINST CERTAIN LIABILITIES THAT MAY ARISE BY REASON\nOF THEIR STATUS OR SERVICE AS DIRECTORS OR OFFICERS. WE HAVE ALSO AGREED TO INDEMNIFY CERTAIN FORMER OFFICERS, DIRECTORS, AND EMPLOYEES OF ACQUIRED COMPANIES IN CONNECTION WITH THE ACQUISITION OF SUCH COMPANIES. WE MAINTAIN DIRECTOR AND OFFICER\nINSURANCE, WHICH MAY COVER CERTAIN LIABILITIES ARISING FROM OUR OBLIGATION TO INDEMNIFY OUR DIRECTORS AND OFFICERS AND FORMER DIRECTORS AND OFFICERS OF ACQUIRED COMPANIES, IN CERTAIN CIRCUMSTANCES. IT IS NOT POSSIBLE TO DETERMINE THE AGGREGATE\nMAXIMUM POTENTIAL LOSS UNDER THESE INDEMNIFICATION AGREEMENTS DUE TO THE LIMITED HISTORY OF PRIOR INDEMNIFICATION CLAIMS AND THE UNIQUE FACTS AND CIRCUMSTANCES INVOLVED IN EACH PARTICULAR AGREEMENT. SUCH INDEMNIFICATION AGREEMENTS MIGHT NOT BE\nSUBJECT TO MAXIMUM LOSS CLAUSES. HISTORICALLY, WE HAVE NOT INCURRED MATERIAL COSTS AS A RESULT OF OBLIGATIONS UNDER THESE AGREEMENTS AND WE HAVE NOT ACCRUED ANY LIABILITIES RELATED TO SUCH INDEMNIFICATION OBLIGATIONS IN OUR CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED\nFINANCIAL STATEMENTS.\n52\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nAS OF DECEMBER 31, 2010, WE DID NOT HAVE ANY RELATIONSHIPS WITH UNCONSOLIDATED ENTITIES OR FINANCIAL\nPARTNERSHIPS, SUCH AS ENTITIES OFTEN REFERRED TO AS STRUCTURED FINANCE OR SPECIAL PURPOSE ENTITIES, WHICH WOULD HAVE BEEN ESTABLISHED FOR THE PURPOSE OF FACILITATING OFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS OR OTHER CONTRACTUALLY NARROW OR LIMITED PURPOSES.\nIN ADDITION, AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2010, WE HAD NO OFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS THAT HAVE, OR ARE REASONABLY LIKELY TO HAVE, A CURRENT OR FUTURE MATERIAL EFFECT ON OUR CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL CONDITION, RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, LIQUIDITY, CAPITAL\nEXPENDITURES, OR CAPITAL RESOURCES.\nCRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES\nOUR DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF OUR FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS IS BASED UPON OUR CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS, WHICH HAVE BEEN\nPREPARED IN ACCORDANCE WITH U.S. GAAP. THE PREPARATION OF THESE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS REQUIRES US TO MAKE ESTIMATES, JUDGMENTS, AND ASSUMPTIONS THAT AFFECT THE REPORTED AMOUNTS OF ASSETS, LIABILITIES, REVENUE AND EXPENSES, AND THE\nRELATED DISCLOSURE OF CONTINGENT ASSETS AND LIABILITIES. WE BASE OUR ESTIMATES ON HISTORICAL EXPERIENCE AND ON VARIOUS OTHER ASSUMPTIONS THAT WE BELIEVE ARE REASONABLE UNDER THE CIRCUMSTANCES, THE RESULTS OF WHICH FORM THE BASIS FOR MAKING JUDGMENTS\nABOUT THE CARRYING VALUES OF ASSETS AND LIABILITIES THAT ARE NOT READILY APPARENT FROM OTHER SOURCES. ACTUAL RESULTS MAY DIFFER FROM THESE ESTIMATES.\nAN ACCOUNTING POLICY IS CONSIDERED TO BE CRITICAL IF IT REQUIRES AN ACCOUNTING ESTIMATE TO BE MADE BASED ON ASSUMPTIONS ABOUT MATTERS THAT ARE HIGHLY UNCERTAIN AT THE TIME THE ESTIMATE IS MADE, AND IF\nDIFFERENT ESTIMATES THAT REASONABLY COULD HAVE BEEN USED, OR CHANGES IN THE ACCOUNTING ESTIMATE THAT ARE REASONABLY LIKELY TO OCCUR, COULD MATERIALLY IMPACT THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS. WE BELIEVE THAT THE FOLLOWING CRITICAL ACCOUNTING\nPOLICIES REFLECT THE MORE SIGNIFICANT ESTIMATES AND ASSUMPTIONS USED IN THE PREPARATION OF THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.\nMANAGEMENT\nHAS DISCUSSED THE DEVELOPMENT AND SELECTION OF THESE CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES WITH THE AUDIT COMMITTEE OF OUR BOARD, AND THE AUDIT COMMITTEE HAS REVIEWED THE DISCLOSURE BELOW. IN ADDITION, THERE ARE OTHER ITEMS WITHIN OUR FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nTHAT REQUIRE ESTIMATION, BUT ARE NOT DEEMED CRITICAL AS DEFINED ABOVE. CHANGES IN ESTIMATES USED IN THESE AND OTHER ITEMS COULD HAVE A MATERIAL IMPACT ON OUR FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.\nREVENUE RECOGNITION.\nOUR REVENUE IS GENERATED FROM DISPLAY, SEARCH, AND OTHER. DISPLAY REVENUE IS GENERATED FROM THE DISPLAY OF GRAPHICAL ADVERTISEMENTS AND SEARCH REVENUE IS GENERATED FROM THE\nDISPLAY OF TEXT-BASED LINKS TO AN ADVERTISER\u0092S WEBSITE. OTHER REVENUE CONSISTS OF LISTINGS-BASED SERVICES REVENUE, TRANSACTION REVENUE, AND FEES REVENUE. WHILE THE MAJORITY OF OUR REVENUE TRANSACTIONS CONTAIN STANDARD BUSINESS TERMS AND\nCONDITIONS, THERE ARE CERTAIN TRANSACTIONS THAT CONTAIN NON-STANDARD BUSINESS TERMS AND CONDITIONS. IN ADDITION, WE ENTER INTO CERTAIN SALES TRANSACTIONS THAT INVOLVE MULTIPLE ELEMENTS (ARRANGEMENTS WITH MORE THAN ONE DELIVERABLE). WE ALSO ENTER\nINTO ARRANGEMENTS TO PURCHASE GOODS AND\/OR SERVICES FROM CERTAIN CUSTOMERS. AS A RESULT, SIGNIFICANT CONTRACT INTERPRETATION IS SOMETIMES REQUIRED TO DETERMINE THE APPROPRIATE ACCOUNTING FOR THESE TRANSACTIONS INCLUDING: (1) WHETHER AN\nARRANGEMENT EXISTS; (2) WHETHER FEES ARE FIXED OR DETERMINABLE; (3) HOW THE ARRANGEMENT CONSIDERATION SHOULD BE ALLOCATED AMONG POTENTIAL MULTIPLE ELEMENTS; (4) ESTABLISHING SELLING PRICES FOR DELIVERABLES CONSIDERING MULTIPLE\nFACTORS; (5) WHEN TO RECOGNIZE REVENUE ON THE DELIVERABLES; (6) WHETHER ALL ELEMENTS OF THE ARRANGEMENT HAVE BEEN DELIVERED; (7) WHETHER THE ARRANGEMENT SHOULD BE REPORTED GROSS AS A PRINCIPAL VERSUS NET AS AN AGENT; (8) WHETHER\nWE RECEIVE A SEPARATELY IDENTIFIABLE BENEFIT FROM THE PURCHASE ARRANGEMENTS WITH CERTAIN CUSTOMERS FOR WHICH WE CAN REASONABLY ESTIMATE FAIR VALUE; AND (9) WHETHER THE CONSIDERATION RECEIVED FROM A VENDOR SHOULD BE CHARACTERIZED AS REVENUE OR A\nREIMBURSEMENT OF COSTS INCURRED. IN ADDITION, OUR REVENUE RECOGNITION POLICY REQUIRES AN ASSESSMENT AS TO WHETHER COLLECTION IS REASONABLY ASSURED, WHICH INHERENTLY REQUIRES US TO EVALUATE THE CREDITWORTHINESS OF OUR CUSTOMERS. CHANGES IN JUDGMENTS\nON THESE ASSUMPTIONS AND ESTIMATES COULD MATERIALLY IMPACT THE TIMING OR AMOUNT OF REVENUE RECOGNITION.\nINCOME TAXES.\nSIGNIFICANT\nJUDGMENT IS REQUIRED IN EVALUATING OUR UNCERTAIN TAX POSITIONS AND DETERMINING OUR PROVISION FOR INCOME TAXES. SEE NOTE 9\u0097\u0093INCOME TAXES\u0094 IN THE NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR ADDITIONAL INFORMATION. WE ESTABLISH\nRESERVES FOR TAX-RELATED UNCERTAINTIES BASED ON ESTIMATES OF WHETHER, AND THE EXTENT TO WHICH, ADDITIONAL TAXES WILL BE DUE. THESE RESERVES ARE ESTABLISHED WHEN WE BELIEVE THAT CERTAIN POSITIONS MIGHT BE CHALLENGED DESPITE OUR BELIEF THAT OUR TAX\nRETURN POSITIONS ARE IN ACCORDANCE WITH APPLICABLE\n53\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nTAX LAWS. WE ADJUST THESE RESERVES IN LIGHT OF CHANGING FACTS AND CIRCUMSTANCES, SUCH AS THE CLOSING OF A TAX AUDIT, NEW TAX LEGISLATION, OR THE CHANGE OF AN ESTIMATE BASED ON NEW INFORMATION. TO\nTHE EXTENT THAT THE FINAL TAX OUTCOME OF THESE MATTERS IS DIFFERENT THAN THE AMOUNTS RECORDED, SUCH DIFFERENCES WILL AFFECT THE PROVISION FOR INCOME TAXES IN THE PERIOD IN WHICH SUCH DETERMINATION IS MADE. THE PROVISION FOR INCOME TAXES INCLUDES THE\nEFFECT OF RESERVE PROVISIONS AND CHANGES TO RESERVES THAT ARE CONSIDERED APPROPRIATE, AS WELL AS THE RELATED NET INTEREST AND PENALTIES.\nWE\nRECORD A VALUATION ALLOWANCE AGAINST CERTAIN OF OUR DEFERRED INCOME TAX ASSETS IF IT IS MORE LIKELY THAN NOT THAT THOSE ASSETS WILL NOT BE REALIZED. IN EVALUATING OUR ABILITY TO REALIZE OUR DEFERRED INCOME TAX ASSETS WE CONSIDER ALL AVAILABLE\nPOSITIVE AND NEGATIVE EVIDENCE, INCLUDING OUR OPERATING RESULTS, ONGOING TAX PLANNING, AND FORECASTS OF FUTURE TAXABLE INCOME ON A JURISDICTION BY JURISDICTION BASIS. IN THE EVENT WE WERE TO DETERMINE THAT WE WOULD BE ABLE TO REALIZE THESE DEFERRED\nINCOME TAX ASSETS IN THE FUTURE, WE WOULD MAKE AN ADJUSTMENT TO THE VALUATION ALLOWANCE, WHICH WOULD REDUCE THE PROVISION FOR INCOME TAXES.\nGOODWILL.\nGOODWILL IS NOT AMORTIZED, BUT IS TESTED FOR IMPAIRMENT ON AN ANNUAL BASIS AND BETWEEN ANNUAL TESTS IN CERTAIN CIRCUMSTANCES. THE\nPERFORMANCE OF THE GOODWILL IMPAIRMENT TEST INVOLVES A TWO-STEP PROCESS. THE FIRST STEP INVOLVES COMPARING THE FAIR VALUE OF OUR REPORTING UNITS TO THEIR CARRYING VALUES, INCLUDING GOODWILL. IF THE CARRYING VALUE OF THE REPORTING UNIT EXCEEDS ITS\nFAIR VALUE, THE SECOND STEP OF THE TEST IS PERFORMED BY COMPARING THE CARRYING VALUE OF THE GOODWILL IN THE REPORTING UNIT TO ITS IMPLIED FAIR VALUE. AN IMPAIRMENT CHARGE IS RECOGNIZED FOR THE EXCESS OF THE CARRYING VALUE OF GOODWILL OVER ITS\nIMPLIED FAIR VALUE.\nOUR REPORTING UNITS ARE BASED ON GEOGRAPHY, EITHER AT THE OPERATING SEGMENT LEVEL OR ONE LEVEL BELOW OPERATING SEGMENTS.\nTHE FAIR VALUES OF OUR REPORTING UNITS ARE ESTIMATED USING AN AVERAGE OF A MARKET APPROACH AND AN INCOME APPROACH AS THIS COMBINATION IS DEEMED TO BE THE MOST INDICATIVE OF OUR FAIR VALUE IN AN ORDERLY TRANSACTION BETWEEN MARKET PARTICIPANTS AND IS\nCONSISTENT WITH THE METHODOLOGY USED FOR THE GOODWILL IMPAIRMENT TEST IN THE PRIOR YEAR. IN ADDITION, WE ENSURE THAT THE FAIR VALUES ESTIMATED UNDER THESE TWO APPROACHES ARE CONSISTENT WITH EACH OTHER. UNDER THE MARKET APPROACH, WE UTILIZE\nPUBLICLY-TRADED COMPARABLE COMPANY INFORMATION TO DETERMINE REVENUE AND EARNINGS MULTIPLES THAT ARE USED TO VALUE OUR REPORTING UNITS ADJUSTED FOR AN ESTIMATED CONTROL PREMIUM. UNDER THE INCOME APPROACH, WE DETERMINE FAIR VALUE BASED ON ESTIMATED\nFUTURE CASH FLOWS OF EACH REPORTING UNIT DISCOUNTED BY AN ESTIMATED WEIGHTED-AVERAGE COST OF CAPITAL, REFLECTING THE OVERALL LEVEL OF INHERENT RISK OF A REPORTING UNIT AND THE RATE OF RETURN AN OUTSIDE INVESTOR WOULD EXPECT TO EARN. DETERMINING THE\nFAIR VALUE OF A REPORTING UNIT IS JUDGMENTAL IN NATURE AND REQUIRES THE USE OF SIGNIFICANT ESTIMATES AND ASSUMPTIONS, INCLUDING SELECTION OF MARKET COMPARABLES, ESTIMATED FUTURE CASH FLOWS, AND DISCOUNT RATES. THESE COMPONENTS ARE DISCUSSED BELOW.\n\u0095\nMARKET COMPARABLES\nWE SELECT COMPARABLE COMPANIES IN THE SPECIFIC REGIONS IN WHICH OUR REPORTING UNITS OPERATE BASED ON SIMILARITY OF TYPE OF BUSINESS, PRIMARILY THOSE INVOLVED IN ONLINE ADVERTISING, AND RELATIVE SIZE OF\nTHOSE COMPANIES COMPARED TO OUR REPORTING UNITS. TRAILING AND FORWARD REVENUE AND EARNINGS MULTIPLES DERIVED FROM THESE COMPARABLE COMPANIES ARE APPLIED TO FINANCIAL METRICS OF EACH REPORTING UNIT TO DETERMINE THEIR ESTIMATED FAIR VALUES.\n\u0095\nESTIMATED FUTURE CASH FLOWS\nWE BASE CASH FLOW PROJECTIONS FOR EACH REPORTING UNIT USING A FIVE-YEAR FORECAST OF CASH FLOWS AND A TERMINAL VALUE BASED ON THE PERPETUITY GROWTH MODEL. THE FIVE-YEAR FORECAST AND RELATED ASSUMPTIONS\nWERE DERIVED FROM THE MOST RECENT ANNUAL FINANCIAL FORECAST FOR WHICH THE PLANNING PROCESS COMMENCED IN OUR FOURTH QUARTER. KEY ASSUMPTIONS IN ESTIMATING FUTURE CASH FLOWS INCLUDE, AMONG OTHER ITEMS, REVENUE AND OPERATING EXPENSE GROWTH RATES,\nTERMINAL VALUE GROWTH RATE, AND CAPITAL EXPENDITURE AND WORKING CAPITAL LEVELS.\n\u0095\nDISCOUNT RATES\nWE EMPLOY A WEIGHTED AVERAGE COST OF CAPITAL (\u0093WACC\u0094) APPROACH TO DETERMINE THE DISCOUNT RATES USED IN OUR CASH FLOW PROJECTIONS. THE DETERMINATION OF THE DISCOUNT RATES FOR EACH REPORTING UNIT\nINCLUDES FACTORS SUCH\n54\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nAS THE RISK-FREE RATE OF RETURN AND THE RETURN AN OUTSIDE INVESTOR WOULD EXPECT TO EARN BASED ON THE OVERALL LEVEL OF INHERENT RISK. THE DETERMINATION OF EXPECTED RETURNS INCLUDES CONSIDERATION\nOF THE BETA (A MEASURE OF RISK) OF TRADED SECURITIES OF COMPARABLE COMPANIES.\nTHE SUM OF THE FAIR VALUES OF OUR REPORTING UNITS IS RECONCILED\nTO OUR MARKET CAPITALIZATION ADJUSTED FOR AN ESTIMATED CONTROL PREMIUM.\nWE CONDUCTED OUR ANNUAL GOODWILL IMPAIRMENT TEST AS OF\nOCTOBER 31, 2010 AND DETERMINED THAT THE FAIR VALUES OF OUR REPORTING UNITS EXCEEDED THEIR CARRYING VALUES AND THEREFORE GOODWILL IN THOSE REPORTING UNITS WAS NOT IMPAIRED.\nSIGNIFICANT MANAGEMENT JUDGMENT IS INVOLVED IN DETERMINING THESE ESTIMATES AND ASSUMPTIONS. CHANGES IN THESE ESTIMATES AND ASSUMPTIONS COULD MATERIALLY AFFECT THE DETERMINATION OF FAIR VALUE FOR EACH\nREPORTING UNIT WHICH COULD TRIGGER FUTURE IMPAIRMENT.\nLONG-LIVED ASSETS\n. WE AMORTIZE LONG-LIVED ASSETS OVER THEIR ESTIMATED USEFUL\nLIVES. IDENTIFIABLE LONG-LIVED ASSETS ARE REVIEWED FOR IMPAIRMENT WHENEVER EVENTS OR CHANGES IN CIRCUMSTANCES INDICATE THAT THE CARRYING VALUE MAY NOT BE RECOVERABLE. DETERMINATION OF RECOVERABILITY IS BASED ON THE LOWEST LEVEL OF IDENTIFIABLE\nESTIMATED UNDISCOUNTED FUTURE CASH FLOWS RESULTING FROM USE OF THE ASSET AND ITS EVENTUAL DISPOSITION. MEASUREMENT OF ANY IMPAIRMENT LOSS IS BASED ON THE EXCESS OF THE CARRYING VALUE OF THE ASSET OVER ITS FAIR VALUE. FAIR VALUE IS DETERMINED BASED\nON THE LOWEST LEVEL OF IDENTIFIABLE ESTIMATED FUTURE CASH FLOWS USING DISCOUNT RATES DETERMINED BY OUR MANAGEMENT TO BE COMMENSURATE WITH THE RISK INHERENT IN OUR BUSINESS MODEL. OUR ESTIMATES OF FUTURE CASH FLOWS ATTRIBUTABLE TO OUR LONG-LIVED\nASSETS REQUIRE SIGNIFICANT JUDGMENT BASED ON OUR HISTORICAL AND ANTICIPATED RESULTS AND ARE SUBJECT TO MANY FACTORS. DIFFERENT ASSUMPTIONS AND JUDGMENTS COULD MATERIALLY AFFECT ESTIMATED FUTURE CASH FLOWS RELATING TO OUR LONG-LIVED ASSETS WHICH\nCOULD TRIGGER IMPAIRMENT. NO IMPAIRMENTS OF LONG-LIVED ASSETS WERE IDENTIFIED DURING ANY OF THE PERIODS PRESENTED.\nINVESTMENTS IN EQUITY\nINTERESTS.\nWE ACCOUNT FOR INVESTMENTS IN THE COMMON STOCK OF ENTITIES IN WHICH WE HAVE THE ABILITY TO EXERCISE SIGNIFICANT INFLUENCE BUT DO NOT OWN A MAJORITY EQUITY INTEREST OR OTHERWISE CONTROL USING THE EQUITY METHOD. IN ACCOUNTING FOR THESE\nINVESTMENTS WE RECORD OUR PROPORTIONATE SHARE OF THE ENTITIES\u0092 NET INCOME OR LOSS, ONE QUARTER IN ARREARS.\nWE REVIEW OUR INVESTMENTS IN\nEQUITY INTERESTS FOR IMPAIRMENT WHENEVER EVENTS OR CHANGES IN BUSINESS CIRCUMSTANCES INDICATE THAT THE CARRYING VALUE OF THE INVESTMENT MAY NOT BE FULLY RECOVERABLE. INVESTMENTS IDENTIFIED AS HAVING AN INDICATION OF IMPAIRMENT ARE SUBJECT TO FURTHER\nANALYSIS TO DETERMINE IF THE IMPAIRMENT IS OTHER-THAN-TEMPORARY AND THIS ANALYSIS REQUIRES ESTIMATING THE FAIR VALUE OF THE INVESTMENT. THE DETERMINATION OF FAIR VALUE OF THE INVESTMENT INVOLVES CONSIDERING FACTORS SUCH AS THE STOCK PRICES OF PUBLIC\nCOMPANIES IN WHICH WE HAVE AN EQUITY INVESTMENT, CURRENT ECONOMIC AND MARKET CONDITIONS, THE OPERATING PERFORMANCE OF THE COMPANIES, INCLUDING CURRENT EARNINGS TRENDS AND FORECASTED CASH FLOWS, AND OTHER COMPANY AND INDUSTRY SPECIFIC INFORMATION.\nTHE FAIR VALUE DETERMINATION, PARTICULARLY FOR INVESTMENTS IN PRIVATELY-HELD COMPANIES, REQUIRES SIGNIFICANT JUDGMENT TO DETERMINE APPROPRIATE ESTIMATES AND ASSUMPTIONS. CHANGES IN THESE ESTIMATES AND ASSUMPTIONS COULD AFFECT THE CALCULATION OF THE\nFAIR VALUE OF THE INVESTMENTS AND THE DETERMINATION OF WHETHER ANY IDENTIFIED IMPAIRMENT IS OTHER-THAN-TEMPORARY.\nSTOCK-BASED COMPENSATION\nEXPENSE.\nWE RECOGNIZE STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION EXPENSE NET OF AN ESTIMATED FORFEITURE RATE AND THEREFORE ONLY RECOGNIZE COMPENSATION EXPENSE FOR THOSE SHARES EXPECTED TO VEST OVER THE SERVICE PERIOD OF THE AWARD. CALCULATING STOCK-BASED\nCOMPENSATION EXPENSE REQUIRES THE INPUT OF HIGHLY SUBJECTIVE ASSUMPTIONS, INCLUDING THE EXPECTED TERM OF THE STOCK-BASED OPTIONS, STOCK PRICE VOLATILITY, AND THE PRE-VESTING AWARD FORFEITURE RATE. WE ESTIMATE THE EXPECTED LIFE OF OPTIONS GRANTED\nBASED ON HISTORICAL EXERCISE PATTERNS, WHICH WE BELIEVE ARE REPRESENTATIVE OF FUTURE BEHAVIOR. WE ESTIMATE THE VOLATILITY OF OUR COMMON STOCK ON THE DATE OF GRANT BASED ON THE IMPLIED VOLATILITY OF PUBLICLY TRADED OPTIONS ON OUR COMMON STOCK, WITH A\nTERM OF ONE YEAR OR GREATER. WE BELIEVE THAT IMPLIED VOLATILITY CALCULATED BASED ON ACTIVELY TRADED OPTIONS ON OUR COMMON STOCK IS A BETTER INDICATOR OF EXPECTED VOLATILITY AND FUTURE STOCK PRICE TRENDS THAN HISTORICAL VOLATILITY.\n55\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nTHEREFORE, EXPECTED VOLATILITY FOR THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2010 WAS BASED ON A MARKET-BASED IMPLIED VOLATILITY. THE ASSUMPTIONS USED IN CALCULATING THE FAIR VALUE OF STOCK-BASED AWARDS\nREPRESENT OUR BEST ESTIMATES, BUT THESE ESTIMATES INVOLVE INHERENT UNCERTAINTIES AND THE APPLICATION OF MANAGEMENT JUDGMENT. AS A RESULT, IF FACTORS CHANGE AND WE USE DIFFERENT ASSUMPTIONS, OUR STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION EXPENSE COULD BE MATERIALLY\nDIFFERENT IN THE FUTURE. IN ADDITION, WE ARE REQUIRED TO ESTIMATE THE EXPECTED PRE-VESTING AWARD FORFEITURE RATE, AS WELL AS THE PROBABILITY THAT PERFORMANCE CONDITIONS THAT AFFECT THE VESTING OF CERTAIN AWARDS WILL BE ACHIEVED, AND ONLY RECOGNIZE\nEXPENSE FOR THOSE SHARES EXPECTED TO VEST. WE ESTIMATE THIS FORFEITURE RATE BASED ON HISTORICAL EXPERIENCE OF OUR STOCK-BASED AWARDS THAT ARE GRANTED AND CANCELLED BEFORE VESTING. IF OUR ACTUAL FORFEITURE RATE IS MATERIALLY DIFFERENT FROM OUR\nORIGINAL ESTIMATES, THE STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION EXPENSE COULD BE SIGNIFICANTLY DIFFERENT FROM WHAT WE HAVE RECORDED IN THE CURRENT PERIOD. CHANGES IN THE ESTIMATED FORFEITURE RATE CAN HAVE A SIGNIFICANT EFFECT ON REPORTED STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION\nEXPENSE, AS THE EFFECT OF ADJUSTING THE FORFEITURE RATE FOR ALL CURRENT AND PREVIOUSLY RECOGNIZED EXPENSE FOR UNVESTED AWARDS IS RECOGNIZED IN THE PERIOD THE FORFEITURE ESTIMATE IS CHANGED. IN ADDITION, BECAUSE MANY OF OUR STOCK-BASED AWARDS HAVE\nVESTING SCHEDULES OF TWO OR THREE YEARS CLIFF VESTS, A SIGNIFICANT CHANGE IN OUR ACTUAL OR EXPECTED FORFEITURE EXPERIENCE WILL RESULT IN THE ADJUSTMENT OF STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION WHICH WAS RECORDED IN PRIOR YEARS FOR ALL UNVESTED AWARDS. IF THE\nACTUAL FORFEITURE RATE IS HIGHER THAN THE ESTIMATED FORFEITURE RATE, THEN AN ADJUSTMENT WILL BE MADE TO INCREASE THE ESTIMATED FORFEITURE RATE, WHICH WILL RESULT IN A DECREASE TO THE EXPENSE RECOGNIZED IN THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS. IF\nTHE ACTUAL FORFEITURE RATE IS LOWER THAN THE ESTIMATED FORFEITURE RATE, THEN AN ADJUSTMENT WILL BE MADE TO LOWER THE ESTIMATED FORFEITURE RATE, WHICH WILL RESULT IN AN INCREASE TO THE EXPENSE RECOGNIZED IN THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS. SEE\nNOTE 11\u0097\u0093EMPLOYEE BENEFITS\u0094 IN THE NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR ADDITIONAL INFORMATION.\nRECENT\nACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS\nSEE NOTE 1\u0097\u0093THE COMPANY AND SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES\u0094 IN THE NOTES TO THE\nCONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.","6745":"ITEM 7.    MANAGEMENT\u0092S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS\nOF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nWE BEGIN MANAGEMENT\u0092S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF\nOPERATIONS WITH AN OVERVIEW OF OUR KEY OPERATING BUSINESS SEGMENTS AND SIGNIFICANT TRENDS, INCLUDING CHANGES TO OUR BUSINESS AS A RESULT OF OUR ACQUISITION OF SUN MICROSYSTEMS, INC. (SUN) IN FISCAL 2010. THIS OVERVIEW IS FOLLOWED BY A SUMMARY OF OUR\nCRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES THAT WE BELIEVE ARE IMPORTANT TO UNDERSTANDING THE ASSUMPTIONS AND JUDGMENTS INCORPORATED IN OUR REPORTED FINANCIAL RESULTS. WE THEN PROVIDE A MORE DETAILED ANALYSIS OF OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND\nFINANCIAL CONDITION.\nBUSINESS OVERVIEW\nWE ARE THE WORLD\u0092S LARGEST ENTERPRISE SOFTWARE COMPANY AND A LEADING PROVIDER OF COMPUTER HARDWARE PRODUCTS AND SERVICES. WE DEVELOP, MANUFACTURE, MARKET, DISTRIBUTE AND SERVICE DATABASE AND\nMIDDLEWARE SOFTWARE; APPLICATIONS SOFTWARE; AND HARDWARE SYSTEMS, CONSISTING PRIMARILY OF COMPUTER SERVER AND STORAGE PRODUCTS. OUR PRODUCTS ARE BUILT ON INDUSTRY STANDARDS AND ARE ENGINEERED TO WORK TOGETHER OR INDEPENDENTLY WITHIN EXISTING\nCUSTOMER INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY (IT), INCLUDING PRIVATE AND PUBLIC CLOUD COMPUTING, ENVIRONMENTS. WE OFFER CUSTOMERS SECURE, RELIABLE, AND SCALABLE INTEGRATED SOFTWARE AND HARDWARE SOLUTIONS THAT ARE DESIGNED TO IMPROVE BUSINESS EFFICIENCIES AND\nMORE EASILY ADAPT TO AN ORGANIZATION\u0092S UNIQUE NEEDS, AT A LOWER TOTAL COST OF OWNERSHIP. WE SEEK TO BE AN INDUSTRY LEADER IN EACH OF THE SPECIFIC PRODUCT CATEGORIES IN WHICH WE COMPETE AND TO EXPAND INTO NEW AND EMERGING MARKETS.\nWE BELIEVE OUR INTERNAL GROWTH AND CONTINUED INNOVATION WITH RESPECT TO OUR SOFTWARE, HARDWARE AND SERVICES BUSINESSES ARE THE FOUNDATION OF OUR LONG-TERM\nSTRATEGIC PLANS. AN IMPORTANT ELEMENT OF OUR CONTINUED INNOVATION AND PRODUCT STRATEGY IS TO FOCUS THE ENGINEERING OF OUR HARDWARE AND SOFTWARE PRODUCTS TO MAKE THEM WORK TOGETHER MORE EFFECTIVELY AND DELIVER IMPROVED COMPUTING PERFORMANCE,\nRELIABILITY AND SECURITY TO OUR CUSTOMERS. OUR ORACLE EXADATA DATABASE MACHINE AND ORACLE EXALOGIC ELASTIC CLOUD PRODUCTS EXEMPLIFY THIS STRATEGY AND ARE CURRENTLY TWO OF OUR MOST IMPORTANT PRODUCTS. BOTH PRODUCTS COMBINE CERTAIN OF OUR HARDWARE AND\nSOFTWARE OFFERINGS TO PROVIDE AN ENGINEERED SYSTEM THAT INCREASES COMPUTING PERFORMANCE RELATIVE TO OUR COMPETITORS\u0092 PRODUCTS, CREATING TIME SAVINGS AND OPERATIONAL COST ADVANTAGES FOR OUR CUSTOMERS. IN FISCAL 2011, 2010 AND 2009 WE INVESTED\n$4.5 BILLION, $3.3 BILLION AND $2.8 BILLION, RESPECTIVELY, IN RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT TO ENHANCE OUR EXISTING PORTFOLIO OF PRODUCTS AND SERVICES AND TO DEVELOP NEW PRODUCTS AND SERVICES.\nWE ALSO BELIEVE THAT AN ACTIVE ACQUISITION PROGRAM IS AN IMPORTANT ELEMENT OF OUR CORPORATE STRATEGY AS IT STRENGTHENS OUR COMPETITIVE POSITION, ENHANCES THE PRODUCTS AND SERVICES THAT WE CAN OFFER TO\nCUSTOMERS, EXPANDS OUR CUSTOMER BASE, PROVIDES GREATER SCALE TO ACCELERATE INNOVATION, GROWS OUR REVENUES AND EARNINGS, AND INCREASES STOCKHOLDER VALUE. IN RECENT YEARS, WE HAVE INVESTED BILLIONS OF DOLLARS TO ACQUIRE A NUMBER OF COMPANIES,\nPRODUCTS, SERVICES AND TECHNOLOGIES THAT ADD TO, ARE COMPLEMENTARY TO, OR HAVE OTHERWISE ENHANCED OUR EXISTING OFFERINGS. WE EXPECT TO CONTINUE TO ACQUIRE COMPANIES, PRODUCTS, SERVICES AND TECHNOLOGIES IN FURTHERANCE OF OUR CORPORATE STRATEGY.\nWE ARE ORGANIZED INTO THREE BUSINESSES\u0097SOFTWARE, HARDWARE SYSTEMS AND SERVICES\u0097WHICH ARE FURTHER DIVIDED INTO SEVEN OPERATING\nSEGMENTS. EACH OF THESE BUSINESSES AND OPERATING SEGMENTS HAS UNIQUE CHARACTERISTICS AND FACES DIFFERENT OPPORTUNITIES AND CHALLENGES. ALTHOUGH WE REPORT OUR ACTUAL RESULTS IN U.S. DOLLARS, WE CONDUCT A SIGNIFICANT NUMBER OF TRANSACTIONS IN\nCURRENCIES OTHER THAN U.S. DOLLARS. THEREFORE, WE PRESENT CONSTANT CURRENCY INFORMATION TO PROVIDE A FRAMEWORK FOR ASSESSING HOW OUR UNDERLYING BUSINESSES PERFORMED EXCLUDING THE EFFECT OF FOREIGN CURRENCY RATE FLUCTUATIONS. AN OVERVIEW OF OUR THREE\nBUSINESSES AND SEVEN OPERATING SEGMENTS FOLLOWS.\nSOFTWARE BUSINESS\nOUR SOFTWARE BUSINESS, WHICH REPRESENTED 68%, 77% AND 81% OF OUR TOTAL REVENUES IN FISCAL 2011, 2010 AND 2009, RESPECTIVELY, IS COMPRISED OF TWO OPERATING\nSEGMENTS: (1) NEW SOFTWARE LICENSES AND (2) SOFTWARE LICENSE UPDATES AND PRODUCT SUPPORT. ON A CONSTANT CURRENCY BASIS, WE EXPECT THAT OUR SOFTWARE BUSINESS\u0092 TOTAL REVENUES GENERALLY WILL CONTINUE TO INCREASE DUE TO CONTINUED DEMAND\nFOR OUR SOFTWARE PRODUCTS AND SOFTWARE LICENSE UPDATES AND PRODUCT SUPPORT OFFERINGS, INCLUDING THE HIGH PERCENTAGE OF CUSTOMERS THAT RENEW THEIR SOFTWARE LICENSE UPDATES AND PRODUCT SUPPORT CONTRACTS, AND DUE TO OUR ACQUISITIONS, WHICH SHOULD ALLOW\nUS TO GROW OUR PROFITS AND CONTINUE TO MAKE INVESTMENTS IN RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT.\n36\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nNEW SOFTWARE LICENSES.\nWE LICENSE OUR DATABASE AND MIDDLEWARE AS WELL\nAS OUR APPLICATIONS SOFTWARE TO BUSINESSES OF MANY SIZES, GOVERNMENT AGENCIES, EDUCATIONAL INSTITUTIONS AND RESELLERS. THE GROWTH IN NEW SOFTWARE LICENSE REVENUES THAT WE REPORT IS AFFECTED BY THE STRENGTH OF GENERAL ECONOMIC AND BUSINESS\nCONDITIONS, GOVERNMENTAL BUDGETARY CONSTRAINTS, THE COMPETITIVE POSITION OF OUR SOFTWARE PRODUCTS, OUR ACQUISITIONS AND FOREIGN CURRENCY FLUCTUATIONS. THE SUBSTANTIAL MAJORITY OF OUR NEW SOFTWARE LICENSE BUSINESS IS ALSO CHARACTERIZED BY LONG SALES\nCYCLES. THE TIMING OF A FEW LARGE SOFTWARE LICENSE TRANSACTIONS CAN SUBSTANTIALLY AFFECT OUR QUARTERLY NEW SOFTWARE LICENSE REVENUES. SINCE OUR NEW SOFTWARE LICENSE REVENUES IN A PARTICULAR QUARTER CAN BE DIFFICULT TO PREDICT AS A RESULT OF THE\nTIMING OF A FEW LARGE SOFTWARE LICENSE TRANSACTIONS, WE BELIEVE THAT ANALYSIS OF NEW SOFTWARE LICENSE REVENUES ON A TRAILING 4-QUARTER PERIOD (AS PROVIDED IN OUR QUARTERLY REPORTS ON FORM 10-Q) PROVIDES ADDITIONAL VISIBILITY INTO THE UNDERLYING\nPERFORMANCE OF OUR NEW SOFTWARE LICENSE BUSINESS. NEW SOFTWARE LICENSE REVENUES REPRESENTED 26%, 28% AND 31% OF OUR TOTAL REVENUES IN FISCAL 2011, 2010 AND 2009, RESPECTIVELY. THE PROPORTION OF OUR NEW SOFTWARE LICENSE REVENUES RELATIVE TO OUR TOTAL\nREVENUES IN FISCAL 2011 AND 2010 WAS AFFECTED BY OUR ENTRY INTO THE HARDWARE SYSTEMS BUSINESS AS A RESULT OF OUR ACQUISITION OF SUN. OUR NEW SOFTWARE LICENSE SEGMENT\u0092S MARGINS HAVE HISTORICALLY TRENDED UPWARD OVER THE COURSE OF THE FOUR\nQUARTERS WITHIN A PARTICULAR FISCAL YEAR DUE TO THE HISTORICAL UPWARD TREND OF OUR NEW SOFTWARE LICENSE REVENUES OVER THOSE QUARTERLY PERIODS AND BECAUSE THE MAJORITY OF OUR COSTS FOR THIS SEGMENT ARE PREDOMINANTLY FIXED IN THE SHORT-TERM. HOWEVER,\nOUR NEW SOFTWARE LICENSE SEGMENT\u0092S MARGINS HAVE BEEN AND WILL CONTINUE TO BE AFFECTED BY THE AMORTIZATION OF INTANGIBLE ASSETS ASSOCIATED WITH COMPANIES THAT WE HAVE ACQUIRED.\nSOFTWARE LICENSE UPDATES AND PRODUCT SUPPORT.\nCUSTOMERS THAT PURCHASE SOFTWARE LICENSE UPDATES AND PRODUCT SUPPORT ARE GRANTED RIGHTS TO UNSPECIFIED PRODUCT UPGRADES\nAND MAINTENANCE RELEASES ISSUED DURING THE SUPPORT PERIOD, AS WELL AS TECHNICAL SUPPORT ASSISTANCE. SUBSTANTIALLY ALL OF OUR CUSTOMERS RENEW THEIR SOFTWARE LICENSE UPDATES AND PRODUCT SUPPORT CONTRACTS ANNUALLY. THE GROWTH OF SOFTWARE LICENSE\nUPDATES AND PRODUCT SUPPORT REVENUES IS PRIMARILY INFLUENCED BY THREE FACTORS: (1) THE PERCENTAGE OF OUR SUPPORT CONTRACT CUSTOMER BASE THAT RENEWS ITS SUPPORT CONTRACTS, (2) THE AMOUNT OF NEW SUPPORT CONTRACTS SOLD IN CONNECTION WITH THE\nSALE OF NEW SOFTWARE LICENSES, AND (3) THE AMOUNT OF SUPPORT CONTRACTS ASSUMED FROM COMPANIES WE HAVE ACQUIRED.\nSOFTWARE LICENSE UPDATES\nAND PRODUCT SUPPORT REVENUES, WHICH REPRESENTED 42%, 49% AND 50% OF OUR TOTAL REVENUES IN FISCAL 2011, 2010 AND 2009, RESPECTIVELY, IS OUR HIGHEST MARGIN BUSINESS UNIT. THE PROPORTION OF OUR SOFTWARE LICENSE UPDATES AND PRODUCT SUPPORT REVENUES\nRELATIVE TO OUR TOTAL REVENUES IN FISCAL 2011 AND 2010 WAS AFFECTED BY OUR ENTRY INTO THE HARDWARE SYSTEMS BUSINESS AS A RESULT OF OUR ACQUISITION OF SUN. SUPPORT MARGINS DURING FISCAL 2011 WERE 86% AND ACCOUNTED FOR 70% OF OUR TOTAL MARGINS. OUR\nSOFTWARE LICENSE UPDATE AND PRODUCT SUPPORT MARGINS HAVE BEEN AFFECTED BY FAIR VALUE ADJUSTMENTS RELATING TO SUPPORT OBLIGATIONS ASSUMED IN BUSINESS COMBINATIONS (DESCRIBED FURTHER BELOW) AND BY AMORTIZATION OF INTANGIBLE ASSETS. HOWEVER, OVER THE\nLONGER TERM, WE BELIEVE THAT SOFTWARE LICENSE UPDATES AND PRODUCT SUPPORT REVENUES AND MARGINS WILL GROW FOR THE FOLLOWING REASONS.\n\u0095\nSUBSTANTIALLY ALL OF OUR CUSTOMERS, INCLUDING CUSTOMERS FROM ACQUIRED COMPANIES, RENEW THEIR SUPPORT CONTRACTS WHEN ELIGIBLE FOR RENEWAL;\n\u0095\nSUBSTANTIALLY ALL OF OUR CUSTOMERS PURCHASE SOFTWARE LICENSE UPDATES AND PRODUCT SUPPORT CONTRACTS WHEN THEY BUY NEW SOFTWARE LICENSES, RESULTING IN A\nFURTHER INCREASE IN OUR SUPPORT CONTRACT BASE. EVEN IF NEW SOFTWARE LICENSE REVENUES GROWTH WAS FLAT, SOFTWARE LICENSE UPDATES AND PRODUCT SUPPORT REVENUES WOULD CONTINUE TO GROW IN COMPARISON TO THE CORRESPONDING PRIOR YEAR PERIODS ASSUMING RENEWAL\nAND CANCELLATION RATES AND FOREIGN CURRENCY RATES REMAINED RELATIVELY CONSTANT SINCE SUBSTANTIALLY ALL NEW SOFTWARE LICENSE TRANSACTIONS RESULT IN THE SALE OF SOFTWARE LICENSE UPDATES AND PRODUCT SUPPORT CONTRACTS, WHICH ADD TO OUR SUPPORT CONTRACT\nBASE; AND\n\u0095\nOUR ACQUISITIONS HAVE INCREASED OUR SUPPORT CONTRACT BASE, AS WELL AS THE PORTFOLIO OF PRODUCTS AVAILABLE TO BE LICENSED AND SUPPORTED.\nWE RECORDED ADJUSTMENTS TO REDUCE SUPPORT OBLIGATIONS ASSUMED IN BUSINESS COMBINATIONS TO THEIR ESTIMATED FAIR VALUES AT THE\nACQUISITION DATES. AS A RESULT, AS REQUIRED BY BUSINESS COMBINATION ACCOUNTING RULES, WE DID NOT RECOGNIZE SOFTWARE LICENSE UPDATES AND PRODUCT SUPPORT REVENUES RELATED TO SUPPORT CONTRACTS THAT WOULD HAVE BEEN OTHERWISE RECORDED BY THE ACQUIRED\nBUSINESSES AS INDEPENDENT ENTITIES IN THE AMOUNT OF $80 MILLION, $86 MILLION AND $243 MILLION IN FISCAL 2011, 2010 AND 2009, RESPECTIVELY. TO THE EXTENT UNDERLYING SUPPORT CONTRACTS\n37\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nARE RENEWED WITH US FOLLOWING AN ACQUISITION, WE WILL RECOGNIZE THE REVENUES FOR THE FULL VALUE OF THE SUPPORT CONTRACTS OVER THE SUPPORT PERIODS, THE MAJORITY OF WHICH ARE ONE YEAR.\nHARDWARE SYSTEMS BUSINESS\nAS A RESULT OF OUR ACQUISITION OF SUN IN JANUARY 2010, WE ENTERED INTO A NEW HARDWARE SYSTEMS BUSINESS. OUR HARDWARE SYSTEMS BUSINESS CONSISTS OF TWO\nOPERATING SEGMENTS: (1) HARDWARE SYSTEMS PRODUCTS AND (2) HARDWARE SYSTEMS SUPPORT. OUR HARDWARE BUSINESS REPRESENTED 19% AND 9% OF OUR TOTAL REVENUES IN FISCAL 2011 AND 2010, RESPECTIVELY, AND WE EXPECT THAT IT WILL CONTINUE TO ADD A\nSIGNIFICANT AMOUNT OF REVENUES AND EXPENSES TO OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS IN COMPARISON TO OUR HISTORICAL OPERATING RESULTS. WE EXPECT OUR HARDWARE BUSINESS TO HAVE LOWER OPERATING MARGINS AS A PERCENTAGE OF REVENUES THAN OUR SOFTWARE BUSINESS DUE TO\nTHE INCREMENTAL COSTS WE INCUR TO PRODUCE AND DISTRIBUTE THESE PRODUCTS AND TO PROVIDE SUPPORT SERVICES, INCLUDING DIRECT MATERIALS AND LABOR COSTS. WE EXPECT TO MAKE INVESTMENTS IN RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT TO IMPROVE EXISTING HARDWARE PRODUCTS AND\nSERVICES OR DEVELOP NEW HARDWARE PRODUCTS AND SERVICES.\nTO PRODUCE OUR HARDWARE PRODUCTS, WE RELY ON BOTH OUR INTERNAL MANUFACTURING\nOPERATIONS AS WELL AS THIRD PARTY MANUFACTURING PARTNERS. OUR INTERNAL MANUFACTURING OPERATIONS CONSIST PRIMARILY OF FINAL ASSEMBLY, TEST AND QUALITY CONTROL OF ENTERPRISE AND DATA CENTER SERVERS AND STORAGE SYSTEMS. FOR ALL OTHER MANUFACTURING, WE\nRELY ON THIRD PARTY MANUFACTURING PARTNERS. WE DISTRIBUTE MOST OF OUR HARDWARE PRODUCTS EITHER FROM OUR FACILITIES OR PARTNER FACILITIES. WE ARE CONTINUING TO FOCUS ON REDUCING COSTS BY SIMPLIFYING OUR MANUFACTURING PROCESSES THROUGH INCREASED\nSTANDARDIZATION OF COMPONENTS ACROSS PRODUCT TYPES, THROUGH A REDUCTION OF THE NUMBER OF ASSEMBLY AND DISTRIBUTION CENTERS THAT WE RELY ON AND A \u0093BUILD-TO-ORDER\u0094 MANUFACTURING PROCESS IN WHICH PRODUCTS ARE BUILT ONLY AFTER CUSTOMERS HAVE\nPLACED FIRM ORDERS. IN ADDITION, WE ARE FOCUSING ON IDENTIFYING HARDWARE SYSTEMS SUPPORT PROCESSES THAT ARE INTENDED TO PROACTIVELY IDENTIFY AND SOLVE QUALITY ISSUES AND TO INCREASE THE AMOUNT OF NEW HARDWARE SYSTEMS SUPPORT CONTRACTS SOLD IN\nCONNECTION WITH THE SALES OF NEW HARDWARE PRODUCTS.\nHARDWARE SYSTEMS PRODUCTS.\nOUR HARDWARE SYSTEMS\nPRODUCTS CONSIST PRIMARILY OF COMPUTER SERVER AND STORAGE PRODUCT OFFERINGS AND HARDWARE-RELATED SOFTWARE, INCLUDING OUR ORACLE SOLARIS OPERATING SYSTEM. OUR HARDWARE SYSTEMS COMPONENT PRODUCTS ARE DESIGNED TO BE \u0093OPEN,\u0094 OR TO WORK IN\nCUSTOMER ENVIRONMENTS THAT MAY INCLUDE OTHER ORACLE OR NON-ORACLE HARDWARE OR SOFTWARE COMPONENTS. WE HAVE ALSO ENGINEERED OUR HARDWARE SYSTEMS PRODUCTS TO CREATE PERFORMANCE AND OPERATIONAL COST ADVANTAGES FOR CUSTOMERS WHEN OUR HARDWARE AND\nSOFTWARE PRODUCTS ARE COMBINED AS ENGINEERED SYSTEMS, AS WITH ORACLE EXADATA AND ORACLE EXALOGIC ELASTIC CLOUD.\nWE OFFER A WIDE RANGE OF\nSERVER SYSTEMS USING OUR SPARC MICROPROCESSOR. OUR SPARC SERVERS ARE DIFFERENTIATED BY THEIR RELIABILITY, SECURITY, SCALABILITY AND CUSTOMER ENVIRONMENTS THAT THEY TARGET (GENERAL PURPOSE OR SPECIALIZED SYSTEMS). OUR MIDSIZE AND LARGE SERVERS ARE\nDESIGNED TO OFFER GREATER PERFORMANCE AND LOWER TOTAL COST OF OWNERSHIP THAN MAINFRAME SYSTEMS FOR BUSINESS CRITICAL APPLICATIONS AND FOR CUSTOMERS HAVING MORE COMPUTATIONALLY INTENSIVE NEEDS. OUR SPARC SERVERS RUN THE ORACLE SOLARIS OPERATING\nSYSTEM AND ARE DESIGNED FOR THE MOST DEMANDING MISSION CRITICAL ENTERPRISE ENVIRONMENTS AT ANY SCALE.\nWE ALSO OFFER A WIDE RANGE OF X86\nSERVERS. THESE X86 SERVERS ARE PRIMARILY BASED ON MICROPROCESSOR PLATFORMS FROM INTEL CORPORATION AND ARE ALSO COMPATIBLE WITH ORACLE SOLARIS, ORACLE LINUX, MICROSOFT WINDOWS AND OTHER OPERATING SYSTEMS.\nOUR STORAGE PRODUCTS ARE DESIGNED TO SECURELY MANAGE, PROTECT, ARCHIVE AND RESTORE CUSTOMERS\u0092 MISSION CRITICAL DATA ASSETS AND CONSIST OF TAPE, DISK,\nHARDWARE-RELATED SOFTWARE INCLUDING FILE SYSTEMS SOFTWARE, BACK-UP AND ARCHIVE SOFTWARE AND STORAGE MANAGEMENT SOFTWARE, AND NETWORKING FOR MAINFRAME AND OPEN SYSTEMS ENVIRONMENTS.\nTHE MAJORITY OF OUR HARDWARE SYSTEMS PRODUCTS ARE SOLD THROUGH INDIRECT CHANNELS, INCLUDING INDEPENDENT DISTRIBUTORS AND VALUE ADDED RESELLERS. WE HAVE ENHANCED DIRECT SALES COVERAGE FOR OUR HARDWARE\nSYSTEMS PRODUCTS AND INTEND THAT OUR DIRECT SALES FORCE WILL SELL PROPORTIONATELY MORE OF OUR HARDWARE SYSTEMS PRODUCTS IN THE FUTURE THAN THEY DO CURRENTLY.\nOUR HARDWARE SYSTEMS PRODUCTS REVENUES, COST OF HARDWARE SYSTEMS PRODUCTS AND OPERATING MARGINS THAT WE REPORT ARE AFFECTED BY THE STRENGTH OF GENERAL ECONOMIC AND BUSINESS CONDITIONS, GOVERNMENTAL\nBUDGETARY CONSTRAINTS, THE COMPETITIVE POSITION OF OUR HARDWARE SYSTEMS PRODUCTS, AND OUR ACQUISITIONS AND FOREIGN CURRENCY\n38\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nFLUCTUATIONS. IN ADDITION, OUR OPERATING MARGINS FOR OUR HARDWARE SYSTEMS PRODUCTS SEGMENT HAVE BEEN AND WILL BE AFFECTED BY THE AMORTIZATION OF INTANGIBLE ASSETS ASSOCIATED WITH OUR ACQUISITION\nOF SUN AND BY BUSINESS COMBINATION ACCOUNTING RULES THAT REQUIRED US TO RECORD ACQUIRED INVENTORIES FROM SUN AT FAIR VALUE, WHICH RESULTED IN AN UNFAVORABLE IMPACT TO OUR EXPENSES AND OPERATING MARGINS AS WE SOLD THESE INVENTORIES TO CUSTOMERS\nDURING FISCAL 2010.\nWE HAVE LIMITED EXPERIENCE IN PREDICTING OUR QUARTERLY HARDWARE SYSTEMS PRODUCTS REVENUES. THE TIMING OF CUSTOMER ORDERS\nAND DELAYS IN OUR ABILITY TO TIMELY MANUFACTURE OR DELIVER A FEW LARGE TRANSACTIONS COULD SUBSTANTIALLY AFFECT THE AMOUNT OF HARDWARE SYSTEMS PRODUCTS REVENUES, EXPENSES AND OPERATING MARGINS THAT WE REPORT.\nHARDWARE SYSTEMS SUPPORT.\nCUSTOMERS THAT PURCHASE OUR HARDWARE SYSTEMS PRODUCTS MAY ALSO ELECT TO PURCHASE OUR\nHARDWARE SYSTEMS SUPPORT OFFERINGS. OUR HARDWARE SYSTEMS SUPPORT OFFERINGS PROVIDE CUSTOMERS WITH SOFTWARE UPDATES FOR THE SOFTWARE COMPONENTS THAT ARE ESSENTIAL TO THE FUNCTIONALITY OF OUR SERVER AND STORAGE PRODUCTS, SUCH AS ORACLE SOLARIS, AND\nCAN INCLUDE PRODUCT REPAIRS, MAINTENANCE SERVICES, AND TECHNICAL SUPPORT SERVICES. TYPICALLY, OUR HARDWARE SYSTEMS SUPPORT CONTRACT ARRANGEMENTS ARE INVOICED TO THE CUSTOMER AT THE BEGINNING OF THE SUPPORT PERIOD AND ARE ONE YEAR IN DURATION. THE\nGROWTH OF OUR HARDWARE SYSTEMS SUPPORT REVENUES IS INFLUENCED BY A NUMBER OF FACTORS, INCLUDING THE VOLUME OF PURCHASES OF HARDWARE PRODUCTS, THE MIX OF HARDWARE PRODUCTS PURCHASED, AND THE PERCENTAGE OF OUR HARDWARE SYSTEMS SUPPORT CONTRACT\nCUSTOMER BASE THAT RENEWS ITS SUPPORT CONTRACTS. ALL OF THESE FACTORS ARE HEAVILY INFLUENCED BY OUR CUSTOMERS\u0092 DECISIONS TO EITHER MAINTAIN OR UPGRADE THEIR EXISTING HARDWARE SYSTEMS\u0092 INFRASTRUCTURE TO NEWLY DEVELOPED TECHNOLOGIES THAT ARE\nAVAILABLE.\nOUR HARDWARE SYSTEMS SUPPORT MARGINS HAVE BEEN AND WILL BE AFFECTED BY FAIR VALUE ADJUSTMENTS RELATING TO HARDWARE SYSTEMS SUPPORT\nOBLIGATIONS ASSUMED THROUGH, AND BY THE AMORTIZATION OF INTANGIBLE ASSETS RESULTING FROM, OUR ACQUISITION OF SUN. AS REQUIRED BY BUSINESS COMBINATION ACCOUNTING RULES, WE RECORDED ADJUSTMENTS TO REDUCE OUR HARDWARE SYSTEMS SUPPORT REVENUES FOR\nCONTRACTS ASSUMED FROM OUR ACQUISITION OF SUN TO THEIR ESTIMATED FAIR VALUES AS OF THE ACQUISITION DATE BY AN AGGREGATE OF $148 MILLION AND $128 MILLION FOR FISCAL 2011 AND 2010, RESPECTIVELY. THESE AMOUNTS WOULD HAVE BEEN RECORDED AS HARDWARE\nSYSTEMS SUPPORT REVENUES BY SUN AS A STANDALONE ENTITY. TO THE EXTENT UNDERLYING HARDWARE SYSTEMS SUPPORT CONTRACTS ARE RENEWED WITH US FOLLOWING AN ACQUISITION, WE WILL RECOGNIZE THE REVENUES FOR THE FULL VALUES OF THE HARDWARE SYSTEMS SUPPORT\nCONTRACTS OVER THE SUPPORT PERIODS.\nSERVICES BUSINESS\nOUR SERVICES BUSINESS CONSISTS OF CONSULTING, CLOUD SERVICES AND EDUCATION. AS A RESULT OF OUR ACQUISITION OF SUN, WE EXPANDED AND ENHANCED OUR CUSTOMER BASE AND SERVICES OFFERINGS, WHICH WE BELIEVE WILL\nINCREASE OUR REVENUES AND EXPENSES IN COMPARISON TO RECENT PERIODS. OUR SERVICES BUSINESS, WHICH REPRESENTED 13%, 14% AND 19% OF OUR TOTAL REVENUES IN FISCAL 2011, 2010 AND 2009, RESPECTIVELY, HAS SIGNIFICANTLY LOWER MARGINS THAN OUR SOFTWARE\nBUSINESS AND WHAT WE HAVE RECENTLY ACHIEVED FROM OUR HARDWARE BUSINESS. THE PROPORTION OF OUR SERVICES REVENUES RELATIVE TO OUR TOTAL REVENUES IN FISCAL 2011 AND 2010 WAS AFFECTED BY OUR ENTRY INTO THE HARDWARE SYSTEMS BUSINESS AS A RESULT OF OUR\nACQUISITION OF SUN.\nCONSULTING.\nOUR CONSULTING LINE OF BUSINESS PRIMARILY PROVIDES SERVICES TO CUSTOMERS\nIN BUSINESS AND IT STRATEGY ALIGNMENT, ENTERPRISE ARCHITECTURE PLANNING AND DESIGN, INITIAL PRODUCT IMPLEMENTATION AND INTEGRATION, AND ONGOING PRODUCT ENHANCEMENTS AND UPGRADES. THE AMOUNT OF CONSULTING REVENUES RECOGNIZED TENDS TO LAG THE AMOUNT\nOF OUR SOFTWARE AND HARDWARE SYSTEMS PRODUCTS REVENUES BY SEVERAL QUARTERS SINCE CONSULTING SERVICES, IF PURCHASED, ARE TYPICALLY SEGMENTABLE FROM THE PRODUCTS WITH WHICH THEY RELATE AND ARE PERFORMED AFTER THE CUSTOMER\u0092S PURCHASE OF THE\nPRODUCTS. OUR CONSULTING REVENUES ARE DEPENDENT UPON GENERAL ECONOMIC CONDITIONS AND THE LEVEL OF OUR PRODUCT REVENUES, IN PARTICULAR THE NEW SOFTWARE LICENSE SALES OF OUR APPLICATION PRODUCTS. TO THE EXTENT WE ARE ABLE TO GROW OUR PRODUCTS\nREVENUES, IN PARTICULAR OUR SOFTWARE APPLICATION PRODUCT REVENUES, WE WOULD ALSO GENERALLY EXPECT TO BE ABLE TO EVENTUALLY GROW OUR CONSULTING REVENUES.\nCLOUD SERVICES.\nOUR CLOUD SERVICES SEGMENT, WHICH WAS FORMERLY NAMED ON DEMAND, INCLUDES CERTAIN OF OUR ORACLE CLOUD SERVICES OFFERINGS AND TECHNOLOGY, AND ADVANCED\nCUSTOMER SERVICES. AS A RESULT OF OUR ACQUISITION OF SUN, WE INCREASED THE VOLUME AND BREADTH OF OUR CLOUD SERVICES OFFERINGS. ORACLE CLOUD SERVICES ARE\n39\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nDESIGNED TO PROVIDE COMPREHENSIVE SOFTWARE AND HARDWARE MANAGEMENT AND MAINTENANCE SERVICES FOR CUSTOMERS HOSTED AT OUR ORACLE DATA CENTER FACILITIES, SELECT PARTNER DATA CENTERS OR PHYSICALLY\nON-SITE AT CUSTOMER FACILITIES. ADVANCED CUSTOMER SERVICES PROVIDES SUPPORT SERVICES, BOTH ONSITE AND REMOTE, TO ORACLE CUSTOMERS TO ENABLE INCREASED PERFORMANCE AND HIGHER AVAILABILITY OF THEIR PRODUCTS AND SERVICES. WE BELIEVE THAT OUR CLOUD\nSERVICES OFFERINGS PROVIDE OUR CUSTOMERS WITH INCREASED BUSINESS PERFORMANCE, REDUCED RISK, A PREDICTABLE COST AND MORE FLEXIBILITY AND CHOICE IN TERMS OF SERVICE IN ORDER TO MAXIMIZE THE PERFORMANCE OF THEIR ORACLE SOFTWARE AND HARDWARE PRODUCTS\nAND SERVICES. WHILE WE HAVE GROWN THE BASE OF CUSTOMERS THAT PURCHASE CERTAIN OF OUR CLOUD SERVICES THROUGH OUR ORGANIC GROWTH AND THE ACQUISITION OF SUN, WE CONTINUE TO FOCUS ON MANAGING OUR EXPENSES TO INCREASE OUR MARGINS AND MARGINS AS A\nPERCENTAGE OF OUR REVENUES. WE HAVE MADE AND PLAN TO CONTINUE TO MAKE INVESTMENTS IN OUR CLOUD SERVICES BUSINESSES TO SUPPORT CURRENT AND FUTURE REVENUE GROWTH, WHICH HISTORICALLY HAS NEGATIVELY IMPACTED CLOUD SERVICES MARGINS AND COULD DO SO IN THE\nFUTURE.\nEDUCATION.\nTHE PURPOSE OF OUR EDUCATION SERVICES IS TO FURTHER THE ADOPTION AND USAGE OF OUR\nSOFTWARE AND HARDWARE PRODUCTS BY OUR CUSTOMERS AND TO CREATE OPPORTUNITIES TO GROW OUR PRODUCT REVENUES. EDUCATION REVENUES ARE IMPACTED BY CERTAIN OF OUR ACQUISITIONS, GENERAL ECONOMIC CONDITIONS, PERSONNEL REDUCTIONS IN OUR CUSTOMERS\u0092\nINFORMATION TECHNOLOGY DEPARTMENTS, TIGHTER CONTROLS OVER DISCRETIONARY SPENDING AND GREATER USE OF OUTSOURCING SOLUTIONS.\nACQUISITIONS\nAN ACTIVE\nACQUISITION PROGRAM IS ANOTHER IMPORTANT ELEMENT OF OUR CORPORATE STRATEGY. IN RECENT YEARS, WE HAVE INVESTED BILLIONS OF DOLLARS TO ACQUIRE A NUMBER OF COMPLEMENTARY COMPANIES, PRODUCTS, SERVICES AND TECHNOLOGIES INCLUDING ART TECHNOLOGY GROUP,\nINC. (ATG) AND PHASE FORWARD INCORPORATED (PHASE FORWARD) IN FISCAL 2011 AND SUN IN FISCAL 2010, AMONG OTHERS. WE BELIEVE OUR ACQUISITION PROGRAM STRENGTHENS OUR COMPETITIVE POSITION, ENHANCES THE PRODUCTS AND SERVICES THAT WE CAN OFFER TO\nCUSTOMERS, EXPANDS OUR CUSTOMER BASE, PROVIDES GREATER SCALE TO ACCELERATE INNOVATION, GROWS OUR REVENUES AND EARNINGS, AND INCREASES STOCKHOLDER VALUE. WE EXPECT TO CONTINUE TO ACQUIRE COMPANIES, PRODUCTS, SERVICES AND TECHNOLOGIES IN FURTHERANCE\nOF OUR CORPORATE STRATEGY. SEE NOTE 2 OF NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS INCLUDED ELSEWHERE IN THIS ANNUAL REPORT FOR ADDITIONAL INFORMATION RELATED TO OUR RECENT ACQUISITIONS.\nWE BELIEVE WE CAN FUND OUR PENDING AND FUTURE ACQUISITIONS WITH OUR INTERNALLY AVAILABLE CASH, CASH EQUIVALENTS AND MARKETABLE SECURITIES, CASH GENERATED FROM OPERATIONS, ADDITIONAL BORROWINGS OR FROM THE\nISSUANCE OF ADDITIONAL SECURITIES. WE ESTIMATE THE FINANCIAL IMPACT OF ANY POTENTIAL ACQUISITION WITH REGARD TO EARNINGS, OPERATING MARGIN, CASH FLOW AND RETURN ON INVESTED CAPITAL TARGETS BEFORE DECIDING TO MOVE FORWARD WITH AN ACQUISITION.\nCRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES\nOUR CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS ARE PREPARED IN ACCORDANCE WITH U.S. GENERALLY ACCEPTED ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES (GAAP) AS SET FORTH IN THE FINANCIAL ACCOUNTING STANDARDS BOARD\u0092S (FASB) ACCOUNTING\nSTANDARDS CODIFICATION (CODIFICATION) AND CONSIDER THE VARIOUS STAFF ACCOUNTING BULLETINS AND OTHER APPLICABLE GUIDANCE ISSUED BY THE SEC. GAAP, AS SET FORTH WITHIN THE CODIFICATION, REQUIRES US TO MAKE CERTAIN ESTIMATES, JUDGMENTS AND ASSUMPTIONS.\nWE BELIEVE THAT THE ESTIMATES, JUDGMENTS AND ASSUMPTIONS UPON WHICH WE RELY ARE REASONABLE BASED UPON INFORMATION AVAILABLE TO US AT THE TIME THAT THESE ESTIMATES, JUDGMENTS AND ASSUMPTIONS ARE MADE. THESE ESTIMATES, JUDGMENTS AND ASSUMPTIONS CAN\nAFFECT THE REPORTED AMOUNTS OF ASSETS AND LIABILITIES AS OF THE DATE OF THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AS WELL AS THE REPORTED AMOUNTS OF REVENUES AND EXPENSES DURING THE PERIODS PRESENTED. TO THE EXTENT THERE ARE MATERIAL DIFFERENCES BETWEEN THESE\nESTIMATES, JUDGMENTS OR ASSUMPTIONS AND ACTUAL RESULTS, OUR FINANCIAL STATEMENTS WILL BE AFFECTED. THE ACCOUNTING POLICIES THAT REFLECT OUR MORE SIGNIFICANT ESTIMATES, JUDGMENTS AND ASSUMPTIONS AND WHICH WE BELIEVE ARE THE MOST CRITICAL TO AID IN\nFULLY UNDERSTANDING AND EVALUATING OUR REPORTED FINANCIAL RESULTS INCLUDE THE FOLLOWING.\n\u0095\nREVENUE RECOGNITION\n\u0095\nBUSINESS COMBINATIONS\n\u0095\nGOODWILL AND INTANGIBLE ASSETS\u0097IMPAIRMENT ASSESSMENTS\n40\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\n\u0095\nACCOUNTING FOR INCOME TAXES\n\u0095\nLEGAL AND OTHER CONTINGENCIES\n\u0095\nSTOCK-BASED COMPENSATION\n\u0095\nALLOWANCES FOR DOUBTFUL ACCOUNTS\nIN MANY CASES, THE ACCOUNTING TREATMENT OF A PARTICULAR TRANSACTION IS SPECIFICALLY DICTATED BY GAAP AND DOES NOT REQUIRE MANAGEMENT\u0092S JUDGMENT IN ITS APPLICATION. THERE ARE ALSO AREAS IN WHICH\nMANAGEMENT\u0092S JUDGMENT IN SELECTING AMONG AVAILABLE ALTERNATIVES WOULD NOT PRODUCE A MATERIALLY DIFFERENT RESULT. OUR SENIOR MANAGEMENT HAS REVIEWED THE BELOW CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND RELATED DISCLOSURES WITH THE FINANCE AND AUDIT\nCOMMITTEE OF THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS.\nREVENUE RECOGNITION\nOUR SOURCES OF REVENUES INCLUDE: (1) SOFTWARE, WHICH INCLUDES NEW SOFTWARE LICENSE REVENUES AND SOFTWARE LICENSE UPDATES AND PRODUCT SUPPORT REVENUES; (2) HARDWARE SYSTEMS, WHICH INCLUDES THE\nSALE OF HARDWARE SYSTEMS PRODUCTS INCLUDING COMPUTER SERVERS AND STORAGE PRODUCTS, AND HARDWARE SYSTEMS SUPPORT REVENUES; AND (3) SERVICES, WHICH INCLUDE SOFTWARE AND HARDWARE RELATED SERVICES INCLUDING CONSULTING, CLOUD SERVICES AND EDUCATION\nREVENUES.\nREVENUE RECOGNITION FOR SOFTWARE PRODUCTS AND SOFTWARE RELATED SERVICES (SOFTWARE ELEMENTS)\nNEW SOFTWARE LICENSE REVENUES REPRESENT FEES EARNED FROM GRANTING CUSTOMERS LICENSES TO USE OUR DATABASE, MIDDLEWARE AND APPLICATIONS SOFTWARE, AND\nEXCLUDE REVENUES DERIVED FROM SOFTWARE LICENSE UPDATES, WHICH ARE INCLUDED IN SOFTWARE LICENSE UPDATES AND PRODUCT SUPPORT REVENUES. WHILE THE BASIS FOR SOFTWARE LICENSE REVENUE RECOGNITION IS SUBSTANTIALLY GOVERNED BY THE ACCOUNTING GUIDANCE\nCONTAINED IN ASC 985-605,\nSOFTWARE-REVENUE RECOGNITION\n, WE EXERCISE JUDGMENT AND USE ESTIMATES IN CONNECTION WITH THE DETERMINATION OF THE AMOUNT OF SOFTWARE AND SERVICES REVENUES TO BE RECOGNIZED IN EACH ACCOUNTING PERIOD.\nFOR SOFTWARE LICENSE ARRANGEMENTS THAT DO NOT REQUIRE SIGNIFICANT MODIFICATION OR CUSTOMIZATION OF THE UNDERLYING SOFTWARE, WE RECOGNIZE NEW SOFTWARE\nLICENSE REVENUES WHEN: (1) WE ENTER INTO A LEGALLY BINDING ARRANGEMENT WITH A CUSTOMER FOR THE LICENSE OF SOFTWARE; (2) WE DELIVER THE PRODUCTS; (3) THE SALE PRICE IS FIXED OR DETERMINABLE AND FREE OF CONTINGENCIES OR SIGNIFICANT\nUNCERTAINTIES; AND (4) COLLECTION IS PROBABLE. REVENUES THAT ARE NOT RECOGNIZED AT THE TIME OF SALE BECAUSE THE FOREGOING CONDITIONS ARE NOT MET ARE RECOGNIZED WHEN THOSE CONDITIONS ARE SUBSEQUENTLY MET.\nSUBSTANTIALLY ALL OF OUR SOFTWARE LICENSE ARRANGEMENTS DO NOT INCLUDE ACCEPTANCE PROVISIONS. HOWEVER, IF ACCEPTANCE PROVISIONS EXIST AS PART OF PUBLIC\nPOLICY, FOR EXAMPLE, IN AGREEMENTS WITH GOVERNMENT ENTITIES WHERE ACCEPTANCE PERIODS ARE REQUIRED BY LAW, OR WITHIN PREVIOUSLY EXECUTED TERMS AND CONDITIONS THAT ARE REFERENCED IN THE CURRENT AGREEMENT AND ARE SHORT-TERM IN NATURE, WE GENERALLY\nRECOGNIZE REVENUES UPON DELIVERY PROVIDED THE ACCEPTANCE TERMS ARE PERFUNCTORY AND ALL OTHER REVENUE RECOGNITION CRITERIA HAVE BEEN MET. IF ACCEPTANCE PROVISIONS ARE NOT PERFUNCTORY (FOR EXAMPLE, ACCEPTANCE PROVISIONS THAT ARE LONG-TERM IN NATURE OR\nARE NOT INCLUDED AS STANDARD TERMS OF AN ARRANGEMENT), REVENUES ARE RECOGNIZED UPON THE EARLIER OF RECEIPT OF WRITTEN CUSTOMER ACCEPTANCE OR EXPIRATION OF THE ACCEPTANCE PERIOD.\nTHE VAST MAJORITY OF OUR SOFTWARE LICENSE ARRANGEMENTS INCLUDE SOFTWARE LICENSE UPDATES AND PRODUCT SUPPORT CONTRACTS, WHICH ARE ENTERED INTO AT THE CUSTOMER\u0092S OPTION AND ARE RECOGNIZED RATABLY OVER\nTHE TERM OF THE ARRANGEMENT, TYPICALLY ONE YEAR. SOFTWARE LICENSE UPDATES PROVIDE CUSTOMERS WITH RIGHTS TO UNSPECIFIED SOFTWARE PRODUCT UPGRADES, MAINTENANCE RELEASES AND PATCHES RELEASED DURING THE TERM OF THE SUPPORT PERIOD. PRODUCT SUPPORT\nINCLUDES INTERNET ACCESS TO TECHNICAL CONTENT, AS WELL AS INTERNET AND TELEPHONE ACCESS TO TECHNICAL SUPPORT PERSONNEL. SOFTWARE LICENSE UPDATES AND PRODUCT SUPPORT CONTRACTS ARE GENERALLY PRICED AS A PERCENTAGE OF THE NET NEW SOFTWARE LICENSE FEES.\nSUBSTANTIALLY ALL OF OUR CUSTOMERS RENEW THEIR SOFTWARE LICENSE UPDATES AND PRODUCT SUPPORT CONTRACTS ANNUALLY.\n41\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nREVENUE RECOGNITION FOR MULTIPLE-ELEMENT ARRANGEMENTS\u0097SOFTWARE PRODUCTS AND SOFTWARE RELATED\nSERVICES (SOFTWARE ARRANGEMENTS)\nWE OFTEN ENTER INTO ARRANGEMENTS WITH CUSTOMERS THAT PURCHASE BOTH SOFTWARE RELATED PRODUCTS AND SERVICES\nFROM US AT THE SAME TIME, OR WITHIN CLOSE PROXIMITY OF ONE ANOTHER (REFERRED TO AS SOFTWARE RELATED MULTIPLE-ELEMENT ARRANGEMENTS). SUCH SOFTWARE RELATED MULTIPLE-ELEMENT ARRANGEMENTS INCLUDE THE SALE OF OUR SOFTWARE PRODUCTS, SOFTWARE LICENSE\nUPDATES AND PRODUCT SUPPORT CONTRACTS AND OTHER SOFTWARE RELATED SERVICES WHEREBY SOFTWARE LICENSE DELIVERY IS FOLLOWED BY THE SUBSEQUENT OR CONTEMPORANEOUS DELIVERY OF THE OTHER ELEMENTS. FOR THOSE SOFTWARE RELATED MULTIPLE-ELEMENT ARRANGEMENTS, WE\nHAVE APPLIED THE RESIDUAL METHOD TO DETERMINE THE AMOUNT OF SOFTWARE LICENSE REVENUES TO BE RECOGNIZED PURSUANT TO ASC 985-605. UNDER THE RESIDUAL METHOD, IF FAIR VALUE EXISTS FOR UNDELIVERED ELEMENTS IN A MULTIPLE-ELEMENT ARRANGEMENT, SUCH FAIR\nVALUE OF THE UNDELIVERED ELEMENTS IS DEFERRED WITH THE REMAINING PORTION OF THE ARRANGEMENT CONSIDERATION RECOGNIZED UPON DELIVERY OF THE SOFTWARE LICENSE OR SERVICES ARRANGEMENT. WE ALLOCATE THE FAIR VALUE OF EACH ELEMENT OF A SOFTWARE RELATED\nMULTIPLE-ELEMENT ARRANGEMENT BASED UPON ITS FAIR VALUE AS DETERMINED BY OUR VENDOR SPECIFIC OBJECTIVE EVIDENCE (VSOE\u0097DESCRIBED FURTHER BELOW), WITH ANY REMAINING AMOUNT ALLOCATED TO THE SOFTWARE LICENSE.\nREVENUE RECOGNITION FOR HARDWARE SYSTEMS PRODUCTS AND HARDWARE SYSTEMS RELATED SERVICES (NONSOFTWARE ELEMENTS)\nREVENUES FROM THE SALE OF HARDWARE SYSTEMS PRODUCTS REPRESENT AMOUNTS EARNED PRIMARILY FROM THE SALE OF COMPUTER SERVERS AND STORAGE PRODUCTS. OUR REVENUE\nRECOGNITION POLICY FOR THESE NONSOFTWARE DELIVERABLES IS BASED UPON THE ACCOUNTING GUIDANCE CONTAINED IN ASC 605,\nREVENUE RECOGNITION\n, AND WE EXERCISE JUDGMENT AND USE ESTIMATES IN CONNECTION WITH THE DETERMINATION OF THE AMOUNT OF HARDWARE\nSYSTEMS PRODUCTS AND HARDWARE SYSTEMS RELATED SERVICES REVENUES TO BE RECOGNIZED IN EACH ACCOUNTING PERIOD.\nREVENUES FROM THE SALES OF\nHARDWARE PRODUCTS ARE RECOGNIZED WHEN: (1) PERSUASIVE EVIDENCE OF AN ARRANGEMENT EXISTS; (2) WE DELIVER THE PRODUCTS AND PASSAGE OF THE TITLE TO THE BUYER OCCURS; (3) THE SALE PRICE IS FIXED OR DETERMINABLE; AND (4) COLLECTION IS\nREASONABLY ASSURED. REVENUES THAT ARE NOT RECOGNIZED AT THE TIME OF SALE BECAUSE THE FOREGOING CONDITIONS ARE NOT MET ARE RECOGNIZED WHEN THOSE CONDITIONS ARE SUBSEQUENTLY MET. WHEN APPLICABLE, WE REDUCE REVENUES FOR ESTIMATED RETURNS OR CERTAIN\nOTHER INCENTIVE PROGRAMS WHERE WE HAVE THE ABILITY TO SUFFICIENTLY ESTIMATE THE EFFECTS OF THESE ITEMS. WHERE AN ARRANGEMENT IS SUBJECT TO ACCEPTANCE CRITERIA AND THE ACCEPTANCE PROVISIONS ARE NOT PERFUNCTORY (FOR EXAMPLE, ACCEPTANCE PROVISIONS THAT\nARE LONG-TERM IN NATURE OR ARE NOT INCLUDED AS STANDARD TERMS OF AN ARRANGEMENT), REVENUES ARE RECOGNIZED UPON THE EARLIER OF RECEIPT OF WRITTEN CUSTOMER ACCEPTANCE OR EXPIRATION OF THE ACCEPTANCE PERIOD.\nOUR HARDWARE SYSTEMS SUPPORT OFFERINGS GENERALLY PROVIDE CUSTOMERS WITH SOFTWARE UPDATES FOR THE SOFTWARE COMPONENTS THAT ARE ESSENTIAL TO THE\nFUNCTIONALITY OF OUR SYSTEMS AND STORAGE PRODUCTS AND CAN ALSO INCLUDE PRODUCT REPAIRS, MAINTENANCE SERVICES, AND TECHNICAL SUPPORT SERVICES. HARDWARE SYSTEMS SUPPORT CONTRACTS ARE ENTERED INTO AT THE CUSTOMER\u0092S OPTION AND ARE RECOGNIZED\nRATABLY OVER THE CONTRACTUAL TERM OF THE ARRANGEMENTS.\nREVENUE RECOGNITION FOR MULTIPLE-ELEMENT ARRANGEMENTS\u0097HARDWARE SYSTEMS\nPRODUCTS AND HARDWARE SYSTEMS RELATED SERVICES (NONSOFTWARE ARRANGEMENTS)\nBEGINNING IN FISCAL 2010, WE HAVE APPLIED THE PROVISIONS OF\nACCOUNTING STANDARDS UPDATE NO. 2009-13,\nREVENUE RECOGNITION (TOPIC 605) MULTIPLE-DELIVERABLE REVENUE ARRANGEMENTS\nAND ACCOUNTING STANDARDS UPDATE 2009-14,\nSOFTWARE (TOPIC 985)\u0097CERTAIN REVENUE ARRANGEMENTS THAT INCLUDE SOFTWARE\nELEMENTS\nTO OUR MULTIPLE-ELEMENT ARRANGEMENTS.\nWE ENTER INTO ARRANGEMENTS WITH CUSTOMERS THAT PURCHASE BOTH NONSOFTWARE RELATED\nPRODUCTS AND SERVICES FROM US AT THE SAME TIME, OR WITHIN CLOSE PROXIMITY OF ONE ANOTHER (REFERRED TO AS NONSOFTWARE MULTIPLE-ELEMENT ARRANGEMENTS). EACH ELEMENT WITHIN A NONSOFTWARE MULTIPLE-ELEMENT ARRANGEMENT IS ACCOUNTED FOR AS A SEPARATE UNIT\nOF ACCOUNTING PROVIDED THE FOLLOWING CRITERIA ARE MET: THE DELIVERED PRODUCTS OR SERVICES HAVE VALUE TO THE CUSTOMER ON A STANDALONE BASIS; AND FOR AN ARRANGEMENT THAT INCLUDES A GENERAL RIGHT OF RETURN RELATIVE TO THE DELIVERED PRODUCTS OR\nSERVICES, DELIVERY OR PERFORMANCE OF THE UNDELIVERED PRODUCT OR SERVICE IS CONSIDERED PROBABLE AND IS SUBSTANTIALLY CONTROLLED BY US. WE CONSIDER A DELIVERABLE TO HAVE STANDALONE VALUE IF THE PRODUCT OR SERVICE IS SOLD SEPARATELY BY US OR ANOTHER\nVENDOR OR COULD BE RESOLD BY THE CUSTOMER. FURTHER, OUR REVENUE\n42\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nARRANGEMENTS GENERALLY DO NOT INCLUDE A GENERAL RIGHT OF RETURN RELATIVE TO THE DELIVERED PRODUCTS. WHERE THE AFOREMENTIONED CRITERIA FOR A SEPARATE UNIT OF ACCOUNTING ARE NOT MET, THE\nDELIVERABLE IS COMBINED WITH THE UNDELIVERED ELEMENT(S) AND TREATED AS A SINGLE UNIT OF ACCOUNTING FOR THE PURPOSES OF ALLOCATION OF THE ARRANGEMENT CONSIDERATION AND REVENUE RECOGNITION. FOR THOSE UNITS OF ACCOUNTING THAT INCLUDE MORE THAN ONE\nDELIVERABLE BUT ARE TREATED AS A SINGLE UNIT OF ACCOUNTING, WE GENERALLY RECOGNIZE REVENUES OVER THE DELIVERY PERIOD. FOR THE PURPOSES OF REVENUE CLASSIFICATION OF THE ELEMENTS THAT ARE ACCOUNTED FOR AS A SINGLE UNIT OF ACCOUNTING, WE ALLOCATE\nREVENUE TO HARDWARE SYSTEMS AND SERVICES BASED ON A RATIONAL AND CONSISTENT METHODOLOGY UTILIZING OUR BEST ESTIMATE OF FAIR VALUE OF SUCH ELEMENTS.\nFOR OUR NONSOFTWARE MULTIPLE-ELEMENT ARRANGEMENTS, WE ALLOCATE REVENUE TO EACH ELEMENT BASED ON A SELLING PRICE HIERARCHY AT THE ARRANGEMENT INCEPTION. THE SELLING PRICE FOR EACH ELEMENT IS BASED UPON THE\nFOLLOWING SELLING PRICE HIERARCHY: VSOE IF AVAILABLE, THIRD PARTY EVIDENCE (TPE) IF VSOE IS NOT AVAILABLE, OR ESTIMATED SELLING PRICE (ESP) IF NEITHER VSOE NOR TPE ARE AVAILABLE (A DESCRIPTION AS TO HOW WE DETERMINE VSOE, TPE AND ESP IS PROVIDED\nBELOW). IF A TANGIBLE HARDWARE SYSTEMS PRODUCT INCLUDES SOFTWARE, WE DETERMINE WHETHER THE TANGIBLE HARDWARE SYSTEMS PRODUCT AND THE SOFTWARE WORK TOGETHER TO DELIVER THE PRODUCT\u0092S ESSENTIAL FUNCTIONALITY AND, IF SO, THE ENTIRE PRODUCT IS\nTREATED AS A NONSOFTWARE DELIVERABLE. THE TOTAL ARRANGEMENT CONSIDERATION IS ALLOCATED TO EACH SEPARATE UNIT OF ACCOUNTING FOR EACH OF THE NONSOFTWARE DELIVERABLES USING THE RELATIVE SELLING PRICES OF EACH UNIT BASED ON THE AFOREMENTIONED SELLING\nPRICE HIERARCHY. WE LIMIT THE AMOUNT OF REVENUE RECOGNIZED FOR DELIVERED ELEMENTS TO AN AMOUNT THAT IS NOT CONTINGENT UPON FUTURE DELIVERY OF ADDITIONAL PRODUCTS OR SERVICES OR MEETING OF ANY SPECIFIED PERFORMANCE CONDITIONS.\nTO DETERMINE THE SELLING PRICE IN MULTIPLE-ELEMENT ARRANGEMENTS, WE ESTABLISH VSOE OF SELLING PRICE USING THE PRICE CHARGED FOR A DELIVERABLE WHEN SOLD\nSEPARATELY AND FOR SOFTWARE LICENSE UPDATES AND PRODUCT SUPPORT AND HARDWARE SYSTEMS SUPPORT, BASED ON THE RENEWAL RATES OFFERED TO CUSTOMERS. FOR NONSOFTWARE MULTIPLE-ELEMENT ARRANGEMENTS, TPE IS ESTABLISHED BY EVALUATING SIMILAR AND\nINTERCHANGEABLE COMPETITOR PRODUCTS OR SERVICES IN STANDALONE ARRANGEMENTS WITH SIMILARLY SITUATED CUSTOMERS. IF WE ARE UNABLE TO DETERMINE THE SELLING PRICE BECAUSE VSOE OR TPE DOESN\u0092T EXIST, WE DETERMINE ESP FOR THE PURPOSES OF ALLOCATING THE\nARRANGEMENT BY REVIEWING HISTORICAL TRANSACTIONS, INCLUDING TRANSACTIONS WHEREBY THE DELIVERABLE WAS SOLD ON A STANDALONE BASIS AND CONSIDERING SEVERAL OTHER EXTERNAL AND INTERNAL FACTORS INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, PRICING PRACTICES INCLUDING\nDISCOUNTING, MARGIN OBJECTIVES, COMPETITION, THE GEOGRAPHIES IN WHICH WE OFFER OUR PRODUCTS AND SERVICES, THE TYPE OF CUSTOMER (I.E. DISTRIBUTOR, VALUE ADDED RESELLER, GOVERNMENT AGENCY AND DIRECT END USER, AMONG OTHERS) AND THE STAGE OF THE PRODUCT\nLIFECYCLE. THE DETERMINATION OF ESP IS MADE THROUGH CONSULTATION WITH AND APPROVAL BY OUR MANAGEMENT, TAKING INTO CONSIDERATION OUR PRICING MODEL AND GO-TO-MARKET STRATEGY. AS OUR, OR OUR COMPETITORS\u0092, PRICING AND GO-TO-MARKET STRATEGIES\nEVOLVE, WE MAY MODIFY OUR PRICING PRACTICES IN THE FUTURE, WHICH COULD RESULT IN CHANGES TO OUR DETERMINATION OF VSOE, TPE AND ESP. AS A RESULT, OUR FUTURE REVENUE RECOGNITION FOR MULTIPLE-ELEMENT ARRANGEMENTS COULD DIFFER MATERIALLY FROM OUR\nRESULTS IN THE CURRENT PERIOD. SELLING PRICES ARE ANALYZED ON AN ANNUAL BASIS OR MORE FREQUENTLY IF WE EXPERIENCE SIGNIFICANT CHANGES IN OUR SELLING PRICES.\nREVENUE RECOGNITION POLICIES APPLICABLE TO BOTH SOFTWARE AND NONSOFTWARE ELEMENTS\nREVENUE RECOGNITION FOR MULTIPLE-ELEMENT ARRANGEMENTS\u0097ARRANGEMENTS WITH SOFTWARE AND NONSOFTWARE ELEMENTS\nWE ALSO ENTER INTO MULTIPLE-ELEMENT ARRANGEMENTS THAT MAY INCLUDE A COMBINATION OF OUR VARIOUS SOFTWARE RELATED AND NONSOFTWARE RELATED PRODUCTS AND\nSERVICES OFFERINGS INCLUDING HARDWARE SYSTEMS PRODUCTS, HARDWARE SYSTEMS SUPPORT, NEW SOFTWARE LICENSES, SOFTWARE LICENSE UPDATES AND PRODUCT SUPPORT, CONSULTING, CLOUD SERVICES AND EDUCATION. IN SUCH ARRANGEMENTS, WE FIRST ALLOCATE THE TOTAL\nARRANGEMENT CONSIDERATION BASED ON THE RELATIVE SELLING PRICES OF THE SOFTWARE GROUP OF ELEMENTS AS A WHOLE AND TO THE NONSOFTWARE ELEMENTS. WE THEN FURTHER ALLOCATE CONSIDERATION WITHIN THE SOFTWARE GROUP TO THE RESPECTIVE ELEMENTS WITHIN THAT\nGROUP FOLLOWING THE GUIDANCE IN ASC 985-605 AND OUR POLICIES AS DESCRIBED ABOVE. AFTER THE ARRANGEMENT CONSIDERATION HAS BEEN ALLOCATED TO THE ELEMENTS, WE ACCOUNT FOR EACH RESPECTIVE ELEMENT IN THE ARRANGEMENT AS DESCRIBED ABOVE.\n43\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nOTHER REVENUE RECOGNITION POLICIES APPLICABLE TO SOFTWARE AND NONSOFTWARE ELEMENTS\nMANY OF OUR SOFTWARE ARRANGEMENTS INCLUDE CONSULTING IMPLEMENTATION SERVICES SOLD SEPARATELY UNDER CONSULTING ENGAGEMENT CONTRACTS AND ARE INCLUDED AS A\nPART OF OUR SERVICES BUSINESS. CONSULTING REVENUES FROM THESE ARRANGEMENTS ARE GENERALLY ACCOUNTED FOR SEPARATELY FROM NEW SOFTWARE LICENSE REVENUES BECAUSE THE ARRANGEMENTS QUALIFY AS SERVICES TRANSACTIONS AS DEFINED IN ASC 985-605. THE MORE\nSIGNIFICANT FACTORS CONSIDERED IN DETERMINING WHETHER THE REVENUES SHOULD BE ACCOUNTED FOR SEPARATELY INCLUDE THE NATURE OF SERVICES (I.E. CONSIDERATION OF WHETHER THE SERVICES ARE ESSENTIAL TO THE FUNCTIONALITY OF THE LICENSED PRODUCT), DEGREE OF\nRISK, AVAILABILITY OF SERVICES FROM OTHER VENDORS, TIMING OF PAYMENTS AND IMPACT OF MILESTONES OR ACCEPTANCE CRITERIA ON THE REALIZABILITY OF THE SOFTWARE LICENSE FEE. REVENUES FOR CONSULTING SERVICES ARE GENERALLY RECOGNIZED AS THE SERVICES ARE\nPERFORMED. IF THERE IS A SIGNIFICANT UNCERTAINTY ABOUT THE PROJECT COMPLETION OR RECEIPT OF PAYMENT FOR THE CONSULTING SERVICES, REVENUES ARE DEFERRED UNTIL THE UNCERTAINTY IS SUFFICIENTLY RESOLVED. WE ESTIMATE THE PROPORTIONAL PERFORMANCE ON\nCONTRACTS WITH FIXED OR \u0093NOT TO EXCEED\u0094 FEES ON A MONTHLY BASIS UTILIZING HOURS INCURRED TO DATE AS A PERCENTAGE OF TOTAL ESTIMATED HOURS TO COMPLETE THE PROJECT. IF WE DO NOT HAVE A SUFFICIENT BASIS TO MEASURE PROGRESS TOWARDS COMPLETION,\nREVENUES ARE RECOGNIZED WHEN WE RECEIVE FINAL ACCEPTANCE FROM THE CUSTOMER THAT THE SERVICES HAVE BEEN COMPLETED. WHEN TOTAL COST ESTIMATES EXCEED REVENUES, WE ACCRUE FOR THE ESTIMATED LOSSES IMMEDIATELY USING COST ESTIMATES THAT ARE BASED UPON AN\nAVERAGE FULLY BURDENED DAILY RATE APPLICABLE TO THE CONSULTING ORGANIZATION DELIVERING THE SERVICES. THE COMPLEXITY OF THE ESTIMATION PROCESS AND FACTORS RELATING TO THE ASSUMPTIONS, RISKS AND UNCERTAINTIES INHERENT WITH THE APPLICATION OF THE\nPROPORTIONAL PERFORMANCE METHOD OF ACCOUNTING AFFECTS THE AMOUNTS OF REVENUES AND RELATED EXPENSES REPORTED IN OUR CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS. A NUMBER OF INTERNAL AND EXTERNAL FACTORS CAN AFFECT OUR ESTIMATES, INCLUDING LABOR RATES,\nUTILIZATION AND EFFICIENCY VARIANCES AND SPECIFICATION AND TESTING REQUIREMENT CHANGES.\nOUR CLOUD SERVICES OFFERINGS ARE COMPRISED OF ORACLE\nCLOUD SERVICES AND ADVANCED CUSTOMER SERVICES AND ARE ALSO A PART OF OUR SERVICES BUSINESS. ORACLE CLOUD SERVICES ARE OFFERED AS STANDALONE ARRANGEMENTS OR AS A PART OF ARRANGEMENTS TO CUSTOMERS BUYING NEW SOFTWARE LICENSES OR HARDWARE SYSTEMS\nPRODUCTS AND SERVICES. ORACLE CLOUD SERVICES ARE DESIGNED TO PROVIDE COMPREHENSIVE SOFTWARE AND HARDWARE MANAGEMENT AND MAINTENANCE SERVICES FOR CUSTOMERS HOSTED AT OUR ORACLE DATA CENTER FACILITIES, SELECT PARTNER DATA CENTERS OR PHYSICALLY ON-SITE\nAT CUSTOMER FACILITIES. ADVANCED CUSTOMER SERVICES PROVIDES SUPPORT SERVICES, BOTH ONSITE AND REMOTE, TO ORACLE CUSTOMERS TO ENABLE INCREASED PERFORMANCE AND HIGHER AVAILABILITY OF THEIR PRODUCTS AND SERVICES. DEPENDING UPON THE NATURE OF THE\nARRANGEMENT, REVENUES FROM CLOUD SERVICES ARE RECOGNIZED AS SERVICES ARE PERFORMED OR RATABLY OVER THE TERM OF THE SERVICE PERIOD, WHICH IS GENERALLY ONE YEAR OR LESS.\nEDUCATION REVENUES ARE ALSO A PART OF OUR SERVICES BUSINESS AND INCLUDE INSTRUCTOR-LED, MEDIA-BASED AND INTERNET-BASED TRAINING IN THE USE OF OUR SOFTWARE AND HARDWARE PRODUCTS. EDUCATION REVENUES ARE\nRECOGNIZED AS THE CLASSES OR OTHER EDUCATION OFFERINGS ARE DELIVERED.\nIF AN ARRANGEMENT CONTAINS MULTIPLE ELEMENTS AND DOES NOT QUALIFY FOR\nSEPARATE ACCOUNTING FOR THE PRODUCT AND SERVICE TRANSACTIONS, THEN NEW SOFTWARE LICENSE REVENUES AND\/OR HARDWARE SYSTEMS PRODUCTS REVENUES, INCLUDING THE COSTS OF HARDWARE SYSTEMS PRODUCTS, ARE GENERALLY RECOGNIZED TOGETHER WITH THE SERVICES BASED\nON CONTRACT ACCOUNTING USING EITHER THE PERCENTAGE-OF-COMPLETION OR COMPLETED-CONTRACT METHOD. CONTRACT ACCOUNTING IS APPLIED TO ANY BUNDLED SOFTWARE, HARDWARE SYSTEMS AND SERVICES ARRANGEMENTS: (1) THAT INCLUDE MILESTONES OR CUSTOMER SPECIFIC\nACCEPTANCE CRITERIA THAT MAY AFFECT COLLECTION OF THE SOFTWARE LICENSE OR HARDWARE SYSTEMS PRODUCT FEES; (2) WHERE CONSULTING SERVICES INCLUDE SIGNIFICANT MODIFICATION OR CUSTOMIZATION OF THE SOFTWARE OR HARDWARE SYSTEMS PRODUCT OR ARE OF A\nSPECIALIZED NATURE AND GENERALLY PERFORMED ONLY BY ORACLE; (3) WHERE SIGNIFICANT CONSULTING SERVICES ARE PROVIDED FOR IN THE SOFTWARE LICENSE CONTRACT OR HARDWARE SYSTEMS PRODUCT CONTRACT WITHOUT ADDITIONAL CHARGE OR ARE SUBSTANTIALLY\nDISCOUNTED; OR (4) WHERE THE SOFTWARE LICENSE OR HARDWARE SYSTEMS PRODUCT PAYMENT IS TIED TO THE PERFORMANCE OF CONSULTING SERVICES. FOR THE PURPOSES OF REVENUE CLASSIFICATION OF THE ELEMENTS THAT ARE ACCOUNTED FOR AS A SINGLE UNIT OF\nACCOUNTING, WE ALLOCATE REVENUES TO SOFTWARE AND NONSOFTWARE ELEMENTS BASED ON A RATIONAL AND CONSISTENT METHODOLOGY UTILIZING OUR BEST ESTIMATE OF FAIR VALUE OF SUCH ELEMENTS.\nWE ALSO EVALUATE ARRANGEMENTS WITH GOVERNMENTAL ENTITIES CONTAINING \u0093FISCAL FUNDING\u0094 OR \u0093TERMINATION FOR CONVENIENCE\u0094 PROVISIONS, WHEN SUCH PROVISIONS ARE REQUIRED BY LAW, TO DETERMINE\nTHE PROBABILITY OF POSSIBLE\n44\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nCANCELLATION. WE CONSIDER MULTIPLE FACTORS, INCLUDING THE HISTORY WITH THE CUSTOMER IN SIMILAR TRANSACTIONS, THE \u0093ESSENTIAL USE\u0094 OF THE SOFTWARE OR HARDWARE SYSTEMS PRODUCTS AND THE\nPLANNING, BUDGETING AND APPROVAL PROCESSES UNDERTAKEN BY THE GOVERNMENTAL ENTITY. IF WE DETERMINE UPON EXECUTION OF THESE ARRANGEMENTS THAT THE LIKELIHOOD OF CANCELLATION IS REMOTE, WE THEN RECOGNIZE REVENUES ONCE ALL OF THE CRITERIA DESCRIBED ABOVE\nHAVE BEEN MET. IF SUCH A DETERMINATION CANNOT BE MADE, REVENUES ARE RECOGNIZED UPON THE EARLIER OF CASH RECEIPT OR APPROVAL OF THE APPLICABLE FUNDING PROVISION BY THE GOVERNMENTAL ENTITY.\nWE ASSESS WHETHER FEES ARE FIXED OR DETERMINABLE AT THE TIME OF SALE AND RECOGNIZE REVENUES IF ALL OTHER REVENUE RECOGNITION REQUIREMENTS ARE MET. OUR STANDARD PAYMENT TERMS ARE NET 30 DAYS. HOWEVER,\nPAYMENT TERMS MAY VARY BASED ON THE COUNTRY IN WHICH THE AGREEMENT IS EXECUTED. PAYMENTS THAT ARE DUE WITHIN SIX MONTHS ARE GENERALLY DEEMED TO BE FIXED OR DETERMINABLE BASED ON OUR SUCCESSFUL COLLECTION HISTORY ON SUCH ARRANGEMENTS, AND THEREBY\nSATISFY THE REQUIRED CRITERIA FOR REVENUE RECOGNITION.\nWHILE MOST OF OUR ARRANGEMENTS FOR SALES WITHIN OUR BUSINESSES INCLUDE SHORT-TERM\nPAYMENT TERMS, WE HAVE A STANDARD PRACTICE OF PROVIDING LONG-TERM FINANCING TO CREDITWORTHY CUSTOMERS THROUGH OUR FINANCING DIVISION. SINCE FISCAL 1989, WHEN OUR FINANCING DIVISION WAS FORMED, WE HAVE ESTABLISHED A HISTORY OF COLLECTION, WITHOUT\nCONCESSIONS, ON THESE RECEIVABLES WITH PAYMENT TERMS THAT GENERALLY EXTEND UP TO FIVE YEARS FROM THE CONTRACT DATE. PROVIDED ALL OTHER REVENUE RECOGNITION CRITERIA HAVE BEEN MET, WE RECOGNIZE NEW SOFTWARE LICENSE REVENUES AND HARDWARE SYSTEMS\nPRODUCTS REVENUES FOR THESE ARRANGEMENTS UPON DELIVERY, NET OF ANY PAYMENT DISCOUNTS FROM FINANCING TRANSACTIONS. WE HAVE GENERALLY SOLD RECEIVABLES FINANCED THROUGH OUR FINANCING DIVISION ON A NON-RECOURSE BASIS TO THIRD PARTY FINANCING\nINSTITUTIONS WITHIN 90 DAYS OF THE CONTRACTS\u0092 DATES OF EXECUTION AND WE CLASSIFY THE PROCEEDS FROM THESE SALES AS CASH FLOWS FROM OPERATING ACTIVITIES IN OUR CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF CASH FLOWS. WE ACCOUNT FOR THE SALES OF THESE RECEIVABLES\nAS \u0093TRUE SALES\u0094 AS DEFINED IN ASC 860,\nTRANSFERS AND SERVICING\n, AS WE ARE CONSIDERED TO HAVE SURRENDERED CONTROL OF THESE FINANCING RECEIVABLES.\nIN ADDITION, WE ENTER INTO ARRANGEMENTS WITH LEASING COMPANIES FOR SALE OF OUR HARDWARE SYSTEMS PRODUCTS. THESE LEASING COMPANIES, IN TURN, LEASE OUR PRODUCTS TO END-USERS. THE LEASING COMPANIES GENERALLY\nHAVE NO RECOURSE TO US IN THE EVENT OF DEFAULT BY THE END-USER AND WE RECOGNIZE REVENUE UPON DELIVERY, IF ALL THE OTHER REVENUE RECOGNITION CRITERIA HAVE BEEN MET.\nOUR CUSTOMERS INCLUDE SEVERAL OF OUR SUPPLIERS AND OCCASIONALLY, WE HAVE PURCHASED GOODS OR SERVICES FOR OUR OPERATIONS FROM THESE VENDORS AT OR ABOUT THE SAME TIME THAT WE HAVE SOLD OUR PRODUCTS TO THESE\nSAME COMPANIES (CONCURRENT TRANSACTIONS). SOFTWARE LICENSE AGREEMENTS OR SALES OF HARDWARE SYSTEMS THAT OCCUR WITHIN A THREE- MONTH TIME PERIOD FROM THE DATE WE HAVE PURCHASED GOODS OR SERVICES FROM THAT SAME CUSTOMER ARE REVIEWED FOR APPROPRIATE\nACCOUNTING TREATMENT AND DISCLOSURE. WHEN WE ACQUIRE GOODS OR SERVICES FROM A CUSTOMER, WE NEGOTIATE THE PURCHASE SEPARATELY FROM ANY SALES TRANSACTION, AT TERMS WE CONSIDER TO BE AT ARM\u0092S LENGTH, AND SETTLE THE PURCHASE IN CASH. WE RECOGNIZE\nNEW SOFTWARE LICENSE REVENUES OR HARDWARE SYSTEMS PRODUCT REVENUES FROM CONCURRENT TRANSACTIONS IF ALL OF OUR REVENUE RECOGNITION CRITERIA ARE MET AND THE GOODS AND SERVICES ACQUIRED ARE NECESSARY FOR OUR CURRENT OPERATIONS.\nBUSINESS COMBINATIONS\nIN FISCAL\n2010, WE ADOPTED ASC 805,\nBUSINESS COMBINATIONS\n, WHICH REVISED THE ACCOUNTING GUIDANCE THAT WE WERE REQUIRED TO APPLY FOR OUR ACQUISITIONS IN COMPARISON TO PRIOR FISCAL YEARS. THE UNDERLYING PRINCIPLES ARE SIMILAR TO THE PREVIOUS GUIDANCE AND\nREQUIRE THAT WE RECOGNIZE SEPARATELY FROM GOODWILL THE ASSETS ACQUIRED AND THE LIABILITIES ASSUMED AT THEIR ACQUISITION DATE FAIR VALUES. GOODWILL AS OF THE ACQUISITION DATE IS MEASURED AS THE EXCESS OF CONSIDERATION TRANSFERRED AND THE NET OF THE\nACQUISITION DATE FAIR VALUES OF THE ASSETS ACQUIRED AND THE LIABILITIES ASSUMED. WHILE WE USE OUR BEST ESTIMATES AND ASSUMPTIONS AS A PART OF THE PURCHASE PRICE ALLOCATION PROCESS TO ACCURATELY VALUE ASSETS ACQUIRED AND LIABILITIES ASSUMED AT THE\nACQUISITION DATE, OUR ESTIMATES ARE INHERENTLY UNCERTAIN AND SUBJECT TO REFINEMENT. AS A RESULT, DURING THE MEASUREMENT PERIOD, WHICH MAY BE UP TO ONE YEAR FROM THE ACQUISITION DATE, WE RECORD ADJUSTMENTS TO THE ASSETS ACQUIRED AND LIABILITIES\nASSUMED, WITH THE CORRESPONDING OFFSET TO GOODWILL. UPON THE CONCLUSION OF THE MEASUREMENT PERIOD OR FINAL DETERMINATION OF THE VALUES OF ASSETS ACQUIRED OR LIABILITIES ASSUMED, WHICHEVER COMES FIRST, ANY SUBSEQUENT ADJUSTMENTS ARE RECORDED TO OUR\nCONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF OPERATIONS.\n45\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nACCOUNTING FOR BUSINESS COMBINATIONS REQUIRES OUR MANAGEMENT TO MAKE SIGNIFICANT ESTIMATES AND ASSUMPTIONS,\nESPECIALLY AT THE ACQUISITION DATE WITH RESPECT TO INTANGIBLE ASSETS, SUPPORT OBLIGATIONS ASSUMED, ESTIMATED RESTRUCTURING LIABILITIES AND PRE-ACQUISITION CONTINGENCIES. ALTHOUGH WE BELIEVE THE ASSUMPTIONS AND ESTIMATES WE HAVE MADE IN THE PAST HAVE\nBEEN REASONABLE AND APPROPRIATE, THEY ARE BASED IN PART ON HISTORICAL EXPERIENCE AND INFORMATION OBTAINED FROM THE MANAGEMENT OF THE ACQUIRED COMPANIES AND ARE INHERENTLY UNCERTAIN.\nEXAMPLES OF CRITICAL ESTIMATES IN VALUING CERTAIN OF THE INTANGIBLE ASSETS WE HAVE ACQUIRED INCLUDE BUT ARE NOT LIMITED TO.\n\u0095\nFUTURE EXPECTED CASH FLOWS FROM SOFTWARE LICENSE SALES, HARDWARE SYSTEMS PRODUCT SALES, SUPPORT AGREEMENTS, CONSULTING CONTRACTS, OTHER CUSTOMER\nCONTRACTS AND ACQUIRED DEVELOPED TECHNOLOGIES AND PATENTS;\n\u0095\nEXPECTED COSTS TO DEVELOP THE IN-PROCESS RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT INTO COMMERCIALLY VIABLE PRODUCTS AND ESTIMATED CASH FLOWS FROM THE PROJECTS WHEN\nCOMPLETED;\n\u0095\nTHE ACQUIRED COMPANY\u0092S BRAND AND COMPETITIVE POSITION, AS WELL AS ASSUMPTIONS ABOUT THE PERIOD OF TIME THE ACQUIRED BRAND WILL CONTINUE TO BE USED\nIN THE COMBINED COMPANY\u0092S PRODUCT PORTFOLIO; AND\n\u0095\nDISCOUNT RATES.\nUNANTICIPATED EVENTS AND CIRCUMSTANCES MAY OCCUR THAT MAY AFFECT THE ACCURACY OR VALIDITY OF SUCH ASSUMPTIONS, ESTIMATES OR ACTUAL RESULTS.\nIN CONNECTION WITH THE PURCHASE PRICE ALLOCATIONS FOR OUR ACQUISITIONS, WE ESTIMATE THE FAIR VALUE OF BOTH SOFTWARE LICENSE UPDATES AND PRODUCT SUPPORT\nAND HARDWARE SYSTEMS SUPPORT OBLIGATIONS ASSUMED. THE ESTIMATED FAIR VALUES OF THESE SUPPORT OBLIGATIONS ARE DETERMINED UTILIZING A COST BUILD-UP APPROACH. THE COST BUILD-UP APPROACH DETERMINES FAIR VALUE BY ESTIMATING THE COSTS RELATED TO\nFULFILLING THE OBLIGATIONS PLUS A NORMAL PROFIT MARGIN. THE ESTIMATED COSTS TO FULFILL THE SUPPORT OBLIGATIONS ARE BASED ON THE HISTORICAL DIRECT COSTS RELATED TO PROVIDING THE SUPPORT SERVICES AND TO CORRECT ANY ERRORS IN THE PRODUCTS ACQUIRED. THE\nSUM OF THESE COSTS AND OPERATING PROFIT APPROXIMATES, IN THEORY, THE AMOUNT THAT WE WOULD BE REQUIRED TO PAY A THIRD PARTY TO ASSUME THE SUPPORT OBLIGATION. WE DO NOT INCLUDE ANY COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH SELLING EFFORTS OR RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT OR\nTHE RELATED FULFILLMENT MARGINS ON THESE COSTS. PROFIT ASSOCIATED WITH ANY SELLING EFFORTS IS EXCLUDED BECAUSE THE ACQUIRED ENTITIES WOULD HAVE CONCLUDED THOSE SELLING EFFORTS ON THE SUPPORT CONTRACTS PRIOR TO THE ACQUISITION DATE. WE ALSO DO NOT\nINCLUDE THE ESTIMATED RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT COSTS IN OUR FAIR VALUE DETERMINATIONS, AS THESE COSTS ARE NOT DEEMED TO REPRESENT A LEGAL OBLIGATION AT THE TIME OF ACQUISITION. AS A RESULT, WE DID NOT RECOGNIZE SOFTWARE LICENSE UPDATES AND PRODUCT\nSUPPORT REVENUES RELATED TO SUPPORT CONTRACTS IN THE AMOUNTS OF $80 MILLION, $86 MILLION AND $243 MILLION THAT WOULD HAVE BEEN OTHERWISE RECORDED BY THE ACQUIRED BUSINESSES AS INDEPENDENT ENTITIES IN FISCAL 2011, 2010 AND 2009, RESPECTIVELY. IN\nADDITION, WE DID NOT RECOGNIZE HARDWARE SYSTEMS SUPPORT REVENUES RELATED TO HARDWARE SYSTEMS SUPPORT CONTRACTS THAT WOULD HAVE OTHERWISE BEEN RECORDED BY SUN AS AN INDEPENDENT ENTITY IN THE AMOUNTS OF $148 MILLION AND $128 MILLION FOR FISCAL 2011\nAND 2010, RESPECTIVELY. HISTORICALLY, SUBSTANTIALLY ALL OF OUR CUSTOMERS, INCLUDING CUSTOMERS FROM ACQUIRED COMPANIES, RENEW THEIR SOFTWARE LICENSE UPDATES AND PRODUCT SUPPORT CONTRACTS WHEN THE CONTRACTS ARE ELIGIBLE FOR RENEWAL AND WE INTEND TO\nFOCUS OUR EFFORTS ON RENEWING ACQUIRED HARDWARE SYSTEMS SUPPORT CONTRACTS. TO THE EXTENT SOFTWARE SUPPORT OR HARDWARE SYSTEMS SUPPORT CONTRACTS ARE RENEWED, WE WILL RECOGNIZE THE REVENUES FOR THE FULL VALUE OF THE SUPPORT CONTRACTS OVER THE SUPPORT\nPERIODS, THE SUBSTANTIAL MAJORITY OF WHICH ARE ONE YEAR.\nIN CONNECTION WITH A BUSINESS COMBINATION, WE ESTIMATE COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH\nRESTRUCTURING PLANS COMMITTED TO BY OUR MANAGEMENT. RESTRUCTURING COSTS ARE TYPICALLY COMPRISED OF EMPLOYEE SEVERANCE COSTS, COSTS OF CONSOLIDATING DUPLICATE FACILITIES AND CONTRACT TERMINATION COSTS. RESTRUCTURING EXPENSES ARE BASED UPON PLANS THAT\nHAVE BEEN COMMITTED TO BY OUR MANAGEMENT, BUT MAY BE REFINED IN SUBSEQUENT PERIODS. WE ACCOUNT FOR COSTS TO EXIT OR RESTRUCTURE CERTAIN ACTIVITIES OF AN ACQUIRED COMPANY SEPARATELY FROM THE BUSINESS COMBINATION. THESE COSTS ARE ACCOUNTED FOR AS\nONE-TIME TERMINATION AND EXIT COSTS PURSUANT TO ASC 420,\nEXIT OR DISPOSAL COST OBLIGATIONS\n. A LIABILITY FOR A COST ASSOCIATED WITH AN EXIT OR DISPOSAL ACTIVITY IS RECOGNIZED AND MEASURED AT ITS FAIR VALUE IN OUR CONSOLIDATED STATEMENT OF\nOPERATIONS IN THE PERIOD IN WHICH THE LIABILITY IS INCURRED. WHEN ESTIMATING THE FAIR VALUE OF FACILITY RESTRUCTURING ACTIVITIES, ASSUMPTIONS ARE APPLIED REGARDING ESTIMATED SUB-LEASE PAYMENTS TO BE RECEIVED, WHICH CAN DIFFER MATERIALLY FROM ACTUAL\nRESULTS. THIS MAY REQUIRE US TO REVISE OUR INITIAL ESTIMATES WHICH MAY MATERIALLY AFFECT OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL POSITION IN THE PERIOD THE REVISION IS MADE.\n46\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nFOR A GIVEN ACQUISITION, WE MAY IDENTIFY CERTAIN PRE-ACQUISITION CONTINGENCIES AS OF THE ACQUISITION DATE\nAND MAY EXTEND OUR REVIEW AND EVALUATION OF THESE PRE-ACQUISITION CONTINGENCIES THROUGHOUT THE MEASUREMENT PERIOD (UP TO ONE YEAR FROM THE ACQUISITION DATE) IN ORDER TO OBTAIN SUFFICIENT INFORMATION TO ASSESS WHETHER WE INCLUDE THESE CONTINGENCIES\nAS A PART OF THE PURCHASE PRICE ALLOCATION AND, IF SO, TO DETERMINE THEIR ESTIMATED AMOUNTS.\nIF WE DETERMINE THAT A PRE-ACQUISITION\nCONTINGENCY (NON-INCOME TAX RELATED) IS PROBABLE IN NATURE AND ESTIMABLE AS OF THE ACQUISITION DATE, WE RECORD OUR BEST ESTIMATE FOR SUCH A CONTINGENCY AS A PART OF THE PRELIMINARY PURCHASE PRICE ALLOCATION. WE OFTEN CONTINUE TO GATHER INFORMATION\nFOR AND EVALUATE OUR PRE-ACQUISITION CONTINGENCIES THROUGHOUT THE MEASUREMENT PERIOD AND IF WE MAKE CHANGES TO THE AMOUNTS RECORDED OR IF WE IDENTIFY ADDITIONAL PRE-ACQUISITION CONTINGENCIES DURING THE MEASUREMENT PERIOD, SUCH AMOUNTS WILL BE\nINCLUDED IN THE PURCHASE PRICE ALLOCATION DURING THE MEASUREMENT PERIOD AND, SUBSEQUENTLY, IN OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.\nIN ADDITION,\nUNCERTAIN TAX POSITIONS\u0092 AND TAX RELATED VALUATION ALLOWANCES ASSUMED IN CONNECTION WITH A BUSINESS COMBINATION ARE INITIALLY ESTIMATED AS OF THE ACQUISITION DATE AND WE REEVALUATE THESE ITEMS QUARTERLY WITH ANY ADJUSTMENTS TO OUR PRELIMINARY\nESTIMATES BEING RECORDED TO GOODWILL PROVIDED THAT WE ARE WITHIN THE MEASUREMENT PERIOD AND WE CONTINUE TO COLLECT INFORMATION IN ORDER TO DETERMINE THEIR ESTIMATED VALUES. SUBSEQUENT TO THE MEASUREMENT PERIOD OR OUR FINAL DETERMINATION OF THE\nUNCERTAIN TAX POSITIONS\u0092 ESTIMATED VALUE OR TAX RELATED VALUATION ALLOWANCES, WHICHEVER COMES FIRST, CHANGES TO THESE UNCERTAIN TAX POSITIONS\u0092 AND TAX RELATED VALUATION ALLOWANCES WILL AFFECT OUR PROVISION FOR INCOME TAXES IN OUR\nCONSOLIDATED STATEMENT OF OPERATIONS AND COULD HAVE A MATERIAL IMPACT ON OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL POSITION.\nGOODWILL AND\nINTANGIBLE ASSETS\n\u0097IMPAIRMENT ASSESSMENTS\nWE REVIEW GOODWILL FOR IMPAIRMENT ANNUALLY AND WHENEVER EVENTS OR\nCHANGES IN CIRCUMSTANCES INDICATE ITS CARRYING VALUE MAY NOT BE RECOVERABLE IN ACCORDANCE WITH ASC 350,\nINTANGIBLES\u0097GOODWILL AND OTHER\n. THE PROVISIONS OF ASC 350 REQUIRE THAT A TWO-STEP IMPAIRMENT TEST BE PERFORMED ON GOODWILL. IN THE\nFIRST STEP, WE COMPARE THE FAIR VALUE OF EACH REPORTING UNIT TO ITS CARRYING VALUE. OUR REPORTING UNITS ARE CONSISTENT WITH THE REPORTABLE SEGMENTS IDENTIFIED IN NOTE16 OF NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS. IF THE FAIR VALUE OF THE\nREPORTING UNIT EXCEEDS THE CARRYING VALUE OF THE NET ASSETS ASSIGNED TO THAT UNIT, GOODWILL IS NOT CONSIDERED IMPAIRED AND WE ARE NOT REQUIRED TO PERFORM FURTHER TESTING. IF THE CARRYING VALUE OF THE NET ASSETS ASSIGNED TO THE REPORTING UNIT EXCEEDS\nTHE FAIR VALUE OF THE REPORTING UNIT, THEN WE MUST PERFORM THE SECOND STEP OF THE IMPAIRMENT TEST IN ORDER TO DETERMINE THE IMPLIED FAIR VALUE OF THE REPORTING UNIT\u0092S GOODWILL. IF THE CARRYING VALUE OF A REPORTING UNIT\u0092S GOODWILL EXCEEDS\nITS IMPLIED FAIR VALUE, THEN WE WOULD RECORD AN IMPAIRMENT LOSS EQUAL TO THE DIFFERENCE.\nDETERMINING THE FAIR VALUE OF A REPORTING UNIT\nINVOLVES THE USE OF SIGNIFICANT ESTIMATES AND ASSUMPTIONS. THESE ESTIMATES AND ASSUMPTIONS INCLUDE REVENUE GROWTH RATES AND OPERATING MARGINS USED TO CALCULATE PROJECTED FUTURE CASH FLOWS, RISK-ADJUSTED DISCOUNT RATES, FUTURE ECONOMIC AND MARKET\nCONDITIONS AND DETERMINATION OF APPROPRIATE MARKET COMPARABLES. WE BASE OUR FAIR VALUE ESTIMATES ON ASSUMPTIONS WE BELIEVE TO BE REASONABLE BUT THAT ARE UNPREDICTABLE AND INHERENTLY UNCERTAIN. ACTUAL FUTURE RESULTS MAY DIFFER FROM THOSE ESTIMATES.\nIN ADDITION, WE MAKE CERTAIN JUDGMENTS AND ASSUMPTIONS IN ALLOCATING SHARED ASSETS AND LIABILITIES TO DETERMINE THE CARRYING VALUES FOR EACH OF OUR REPORTING UNITS. OUR MOST RECENT ANNUAL GOODWILL IMPAIRMENT ANALYSIS, WHICH WAS PERFORMED DURING THE\nFOURTH QUARTER OF FISCAL 2011, DID NOT RESULT IN AN IMPAIRMENT CHARGE, NOR DID WE RECORD ANY GOODWILL IMPAIRMENT IN FISCAL 2010 OR 2009.\nWE\nMAKE JUDGMENTS ABOUT THE RECOVERABILITY OF PURCHASED FINITE LIVED INTANGIBLE ASSETS WHENEVER EVENTS OR CHANGES IN CIRCUMSTANCES INDICATE THAT AN IMPAIRMENT MAY EXIST. EACH PERIOD WE EVALUATE THE ESTIMATED REMAINING USEFUL LIVES OF PURCHASED\nINTANGIBLE ASSETS AND WHETHER EVENTS OR CHANGES IN CIRCUMSTANCES WARRANT A REVISION TO THE REMAINING PERIODS OF AMORTIZATION. RECOVERABILITY OF FINITE LIVED INTANGIBLE ASSETS IS MEASURED BY COMPARISON OF THE CARRYING AMOUNT OF THE ASSET TO THE\nFUTURE UNDISCOUNTED CASH FLOWS THE ASSET IS EXPECTED TO GENERATE. WE REVIEW INDEFINITE LIVED INTANGIBLE ASSETS FOR IMPAIRMENT ANNUALLY AND WHENEVER EVENTS OR CHANGES IN CIRCUMSTANCES INDICATE THE CARRYING VALUE MAY NOT BE RECOVERABLE. RECOVERABILITY\nOF INDEFINITE LIVED INTANGIBLE ASSETS IS MEASURED BY COMPARISON OF THE CARRYING AMOUNT OF THE ASSET TO ITS FAIR VALUE. IF THE ASSET IS CONSIDERED TO BE IMPAIRED, THE AMOUNT OF ANY IMPAIRMENT IS MEASURED AS THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE CARRYING VALUE\nAND THE FAIR VALUE OF THE IMPAIRED ASSET.\n47\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nASSUMPTIONS AND ESTIMATES ABOUT FUTURE VALUES AND REMAINING USEFUL LIVES OF OUR INTANGIBLE AND OTHER\nLONG-LIVED ASSETS ARE COMPLEX AND SUBJECTIVE. THEY CAN BE AFFECTED BY A VARIETY OF FACTORS, INCLUDING EXTERNAL FACTORS SUCH AS INDUSTRY AND ECONOMIC TRENDS, AND INTERNAL FACTORS SUCH AS CHANGES IN OUR BUSINESS STRATEGY AND OUR INTERNAL FORECASTS.\nALTHOUGH WE BELIEVE THE HISTORICAL ASSUMPTIONS AND ESTIMATES WE HAVE MADE ARE REASONABLE AND APPROPRIATE, DIFFERENT ASSUMPTIONS AND ESTIMATES COULD MATERIALLY IMPACT OUR REPORTED FINANCIAL RESULTS. WE DID NOT RECOGNIZE ANY INTANGIBLE ASSET\nIMPAIRMENT CHARGES IN FISCAL 2011, 2010 OR 2009.\nACCOUNTING FOR INCOME TAXES\nSIGNIFICANT JUDGMENT IS REQUIRED IN DETERMINING OUR WORLDWIDE INCOME TAX PROVISION. IN THE ORDINARY COURSE OF A GLOBAL BUSINESS, THERE ARE MANY\nTRANSACTIONS AND CALCULATIONS WHERE THE ULTIMATE TAX OUTCOME IS UNCERTAIN. SOME OF THESE UNCERTAINTIES ARISE AS A CONSEQUENCE OF REVENUE SHARING AND COST REIMBURSEMENT ARRANGEMENTS AMONG RELATED ENTITIES, THE PROCESS OF IDENTIFYING ITEMS OF REVENUES\nAND EXPENSES THAT QUALIFY FOR PREFERENTIAL TAX TREATMENT, AND SEGREGATION OF FOREIGN AND DOMESTIC EARNINGS AND EXPENSES TO AVOID DOUBLE TAXATION. ALTHOUGH WE BELIEVE THAT OUR ESTIMATES ARE REASONABLE, THE FINAL TAX OUTCOME OF THESE MATTERS COULD BE\nDIFFERENT FROM THAT WHICH IS REFLECTED IN OUR HISTORICAL INCOME TAX PROVISIONS AND ACCRUALS. SUCH DIFFERENCES COULD HAVE A MATERIAL EFFECT ON OUR INCOME TAX PROVISION AND NET INCOME IN THE PERIOD IN WHICH SUCH DETERMINATION IS MADE.\nOUR EFFECTIVE TAX RATE INCLUDES THE IMPACT OF CERTAIN UNDISTRIBUTED FOREIGN EARNINGS FOR WHICH NO U.S. TAXES HAVE BEEN PROVIDED BECAUSE SUCH EARNINGS ARE\nPLANNED TO BE INDEFINITELY REINVESTED OUTSIDE THE UNITED STATES. REMITTANCES OF FOREIGN EARNINGS TO THE U.S. ARE PLANNED BASED ON PROJECTED CASH FLOW, WORKING CAPITAL AND INVESTMENT NEEDS OF OUR FOREIGN AND DOMESTIC OPERATIONS. BASED ON THESE\nASSUMPTIONS, WE ESTIMATE THE AMOUNT THAT WILL BE DISTRIBUTED TO THE U.S. AND PROVIDE U.S. FEDERAL TAXES ON THESE AMOUNTS. MATERIAL CHANGES IN OUR ESTIMATES AS TO HOW MUCH OF OUR FOREIGN EARNINGS WILL BE DISTRIBUTED TO THE U.S. OR TAX LEGISLATION\nTHAT LIMITS OR RESTRICTS THE AMOUNT OF UNDISTRIBUTED FOREIGN EARNINGS THAT WE CONSIDER INDEFINITELY REINVESTED OUTSIDE THE UNITED STATES COULD MATERIALLY IMPACT OUR INCOME TAX PROVISION AND EFFECTIVE TAX RATE.\nWE RECORD A VALUATION ALLOWANCE TO REDUCE OUR DEFERRED TAX ASSETS TO THE AMOUNT THAT IS MORE LIKELY THAN NOT TO BE REALIZED. IN ORDER FOR US TO REALIZE\nOUR DEFERRED TAX ASSETS, WE MUST BE ABLE TO GENERATE SUFFICIENT TAXABLE INCOME IN THOSE JURISDICTIONS WHERE THE DEFERRED TAX ASSETS ARE LOCATED. WE CONSIDER FUTURE GROWTH, FORECASTED EARNINGS, FUTURE TAXABLE INCOME, THE MIX OF EARNINGS IN THE\nJURISDICTIONS IN WHICH WE OPERATE, HISTORICAL EARNINGS, TAXABLE INCOME IN PRIOR YEARS, IF CARRYBACK IS PERMITTED UNDER THE LAW, AND PRUDENT AND FEASIBLE TAX PLANNING STRATEGIES IN DETERMINING THE NEED FOR A VALUATION ALLOWANCE. IN THE EVENT WE WERE\nTO DETERMINE THAT WE WOULD NOT BE ABLE TO REALIZE ALL OR PART OF OUR NET DEFERRED TAX ASSETS IN THE FUTURE, AN ADJUSTMENT TO THE DEFERRED TAX ASSETS VALUATION ALLOWANCE WOULD BE CHARGED TO EARNINGS IN THE PERIOD IN WHICH WE MAKE SUCH A\nDETERMINATION, OR GOODWILL WOULD BE ADJUSTED AT OUR FINAL DETERMINATION OF THE VALUATION ALLOWANCE RELATED TO AN ACQUISITION WITHIN THE MEASUREMENT PERIOD. IF WE LATER DETERMINE THAT IT IS MORE LIKELY THAN NOT THAT THE NET DEFERRED TAX ASSETS WOULD\nBE REALIZED, WE WOULD REVERSE THE APPLICABLE PORTION OF THE PREVIOUSLY PROVIDED VALUATION ALLOWANCE AS AN ADJUSTMENT TO EARNINGS AT SUCH TIME.\nWE CALCULATE OUR CURRENT AND DEFERRED TAX PROVISION BASED ON ESTIMATES AND ASSUMPTIONS THAT COULD DIFFER FROM THE ACTUAL RESULTS REFLECTED IN INCOME TAX\nRETURNS FILED DURING THE SUBSEQUENT YEAR. ADJUSTMENTS BASED ON FILED RETURNS ARE GENERALLY RECORDED IN THE PERIOD WHEN THE TAX RETURNS ARE FILED AND THE GLOBAL TAX IMPLICATIONS ARE KNOWN, WHICH CAN MATERIALLY IMPACT OUR EFFECTIVE TAX RATE.\nTHE AMOUNT OF INCOME TAX WE PAY IS SUBJECT TO ONGOING AUDITS BY FEDERAL, STATE AND FOREIGN TAX AUTHORITIES, WHICH OFTEN RESULT IN PROPOSED\nASSESSMENTS. OUR ESTIMATE OF THE POTENTIAL OUTCOME FOR ANY UNCERTAIN TAX ISSUE IS HIGHLY JUDGMENTAL. A DESCRIPTION OF OUR ACCOUNTING POLICIES ASSOCIATED WITH TAX RELATED CONTINGENCIES ASSUMED AS A PART OF A BUSINESS COMBINATION IS PROVIDED UNDER\n\u0093BUSINESS COMBINATIONS\u0094 ABOVE. FOR THOSE TAX RELATED CONTINGENCIES THAT ARE NOT A PART OF A BUSINESS COMBINATION, WE ACCOUNT FOR THESE UNCERTAIN TAX ISSUES PURSUANT TO ASC 740,\nINCOME TAXES\n, WHICH CONTAINS A TWO-STEP APPROACH TO\nRECOGNIZING AND MEASURING UNCERTAIN TAX POSITIONS TAKEN OR EXPECTED TO BE TAKEN IN A TAX RETURN. THE FIRST STEP IS TO DETERMINE IF THE WEIGHT OF AVAILABLE EVIDENCE INDICATES THAT IT IS MORE LIKELY THAN NOT THAT THE TAX POSITION WILL BE SUSTAINED ON\nAUDIT, INCLUDING RESOLUTION OF ANY RELATED APPEALS OR LITIGATION PROCESSES. THE SECOND STEP IS TO MEASURE THE TAX BENEFIT AS THE LARGEST AMOUNT THAT IS MORE THAN 50% LIKELY TO BE REALIZED UPON ULTIMATE SETTLEMENT. ALTHOUGH WE BELIEVE WE HAVE\nADEQUATELY RESERVED FOR\n48\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nOUR UNCERTAIN TAX POSITIONS, NO ASSURANCE CAN BE GIVEN WITH RESPECT TO THE FINAL OUTCOME OF THESE MATTERS. WE ADJUST RESERVES FOR OUR UNCERTAIN TAX POSITIONS DUE TO CHANGING FACTS AND\nCIRCUMSTANCES, SUCH AS THE CLOSING OF A TAX AUDIT, JUDICIAL RULINGS, REFINEMENT OF ESTIMATES OR REALIZATION OF EARNINGS OR DEDUCTIONS THAT DIFFER FROM OUR ESTIMATES. TO THE EXTENT THAT THE FINAL OUTCOME OF THESE MATTERS IS DIFFERENT THAN THE AMOUNTS\nRECORDED, SUCH DIFFERENCES GENERALLY WILL IMPACT OUR PROVISION FOR INCOME TAXES IN THE PERIOD IN WHICH SUCH A DETERMINATION IS MADE. OUR PROVISIONS FOR INCOME TAXES INCLUDE THE IMPACT OF RESERVE PROVISIONS AND CHANGES TO RESERVES THAT ARE CONSIDERED\nAPPROPRIATE AND ALSO INCLUDE THE RELATED INTEREST AND PENALTIES.\nIN ADDITION, AS A PART OF OUR ACCOUNTING FOR BUSINESS COMBINATIONS, SOME OF\nTHE PURCHASE PRICE IS ALLOCATED TO GOODWILL AND INTANGIBLE ASSETS. IMPAIRMENT CHARGES ASSOCIATED WITH GOODWILL ARE GENERALLY NOT TAX DEDUCTIBLE AND WILL RESULT IN AN INCREASED EFFECTIVE INCOME TAX RATE IN THE PERIOD THAT ANY IMPAIRMENT IS RECORDED.\nAMORTIZATION EXPENSES ASSOCIATED WITH ACQUIRED INTANGIBLE ASSETS ARE GENERALLY NOT TAX DEDUCTIBLE PURSUANT TO OUR EXISTING TAX STRUCTURE; HOWEVER, DEFERRED TAXES HAVE BEEN RECORDED FOR NON-DEDUCTIBLE AMORTIZATION EXPENSES AS A PART OF THE PURCHASE\nPRICE ALLOCATION PROCESS. WE HAVE TAKEN INTO ACCOUNT THE ALLOCATION OF THESE IDENTIFIED INTANGIBLES AMONG DIFFERENT TAXING JURISDICTIONS, INCLUDING THOSE WITH NOMINAL OR ZERO PERCENT TAX RATES, IN ESTABLISHING THE RELATED DEFERRED TAX LIABILITIES.\nLEGAL AND OTHER CONTINGENCIES\nWE ARE CURRENTLY INVOLVED IN VARIOUS CLAIMS AND LEGAL PROCEEDINGS. QUARTERLY, WE REVIEW THE STATUS OF EACH SIGNIFICANT MATTER AND ASSESS OUR POTENTIAL FINANCIAL EXPOSURE. A DESCRIPTION OF OUR ACCOUNTING\nPOLICIES ASSOCIATED WITH CONTINGENCIES ASSUMED AS A PART OF A BUSINESS COMBINATION IS PROVIDED UNDER \u0093BUSINESS COMBINATIONS\u0094 ABOVE. FOR LEGAL AND OTHER CONTINGENCIES THAT ARE NOT A PART OF A BUSINESS COMBINATION, WE ACCRUE A LIABILITY FOR\nAN ESTIMATED LOSS IF THE POTENTIAL LOSS FROM ANY CLAIM OR LEGAL PROCEEDING IS CONSIDERED PROBABLE AND THE AMOUNT CAN BE REASONABLY ESTIMATED. SIGNIFICANT JUDGMENT IS REQUIRED IN BOTH THE DETERMINATION OF PROBABILITY AND THE DETERMINATION AS TO\nWHETHER THE AMOUNT OF AN EXPOSURE IS REASONABLY ESTIMABLE. BECAUSE OF UNCERTAINTIES RELATED TO THESE MATTERS, ACCRUALS ARE BASED ONLY ON THE BEST INFORMATION AVAILABLE AT THE TIME THE ACCRUALS ARE MADE. AS ADDITIONAL INFORMATION BECOMES AVAILABLE,\nWE REASSESS THE POTENTIAL LIABILITY RELATED TO OUR PENDING CLAIMS AND LITIGATION AND MAY REVISE OUR ESTIMATES. SUCH REVISIONS IN THE ESTIMATES OF THE POTENTIAL LIABILITIES COULD HAVE A MATERIAL IMPACT ON OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL\nPOSITION.\nSTOCK-BASED COMPENSATION\nWE ACCOUNT FOR SHARE-BASED PAYMENTS TO EMPLOYEES, INCLUDING GRANTS OF EMPLOYEE STOCK AWARDS AND PURCHASES UNDER EMPLOYEE STOCK PURCHASE PLANS IN ACCORDANCE WITH ASC 718,\nCOMPENSATION\u0097STOCK\nCOMPENSATION,\nWHICH REQUIRES THAT SHARE-BASED PAYMENTS (TO THE EXTENT THEY ARE COMPENSATORY) BE RECOGNIZED IN OUR CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF OPERATIONS BASED ON THEIR FAIR VALUES. WE RECOGNIZE STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION EXPENSE ON A STRAIGHT-LINE\nBASIS OVER THE SERVICE PERIOD OF THE AWARD, WHICH IS GENERALLY FOUR YEARS.\nWE ARE REQUIRED TO ESTIMATE THE STOCK AWARDS THAT WE ULTIMATELY\nEXPECT TO VEST AND TO REDUCE STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION EXPENSE FOR THE EFFECTS OF ESTIMATED FORFEITURES OF AWARDS OVER THE EXPENSE RECOGNITION PERIOD. ALTHOUGH WE ESTIMATE THE RATE OF FUTURE FORFEITURES UPON HISTORICAL EXPERIENCE, ACTUAL FORFEITURES\nIN THE FUTURE MAY DIFFER. TO THE EXTENT OUR ACTUAL FORFEITURES ARE DIFFERENT THAN OUR ESTIMATES, WE RECORD A TRUE-UP FOR THE DIFFERENCE IN THE PERIOD THAT THE AWARDS VEST, AND SUCH TRUE-UPS COULD MATERIALLY AFFECT OUR OPERATING RESULTS.\nADDITIONALLY, WE ALSO CONSIDER ON A QUARTERLY BASIS WHETHER THERE HAVE BEEN ANY SIGNIFICANT CHANGES IN FACTS AND CIRCUMSTANCES THAT WOULD AFFECT OUR EXPECTED FORFEITURE RATE.\nWE ESTIMATE THE FAIR VALUES OF EMPLOYEE STOCK OPTIONS USING A BLACK-SCHOLES-MERTON VALUATION MODEL. THE FAIR VALUE OF AN AWARD IS AFFECTED BY OUR STOCK PRICE ON THE DATE OF GRANT AS WELL AS OTHER\nASSUMPTIONS INCLUDING THE ESTIMATED VOLATILITY OF OUR STOCK PRICE OVER THE TERM OF THE AWARDS AND THE ESTIMATED PERIOD OF TIME THAT WE EXPECT EMPLOYEES TO HOLD THEIR STOCK OPTIONS. THE RISK-FREE INTEREST RATE ASSUMPTION WE USE IS BASED UPON UNITED\nSTATES TREASURY INTEREST RATES APPROPRIATE FOR THE EXPECTED LIFE OF THE AWARDS. WE USE THE IMPLIED VOLATILITY OF OUR PUBLICLY TRADED, LONGEST-TERM OPTIONS IN ORDER TO ESTIMATE FUTURE STOCK PRICE TRENDS AS WE BELIEVE THAT IMPLIED VOLATILITY IS MORE\nREPRESENTATIVE OF FUTURE STOCK PRICE TRENDS THAN HISTORICAL VOLATILITY. IN ORDER TO DETERMINE THE ESTIMATED PERIOD OF TIME THAT WE EXPECT EMPLOYEES TO HOLD THEIR STOCK OPTIONS, WE HAVE USED HISTORICAL RATES OF\n49\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nEMPLOYEE GROUPS BY SENIORITY OF JOB CLASSIFICATION. OUR EXPECTED DIVIDEND RATE IS BASED UPON AN ANNUALIZED DIVIDEND YIELD BASED ON THE PER SHARE DIVIDEND DECLARED BY OUR BOARD OF DIRECTORS. THE\nAFOREMENTIONED INPUTS ENTERED INTO THE OPTION VALUATION MODEL WE USE TO FAIR VALUE OUR STOCK AWARDS ARE SUBJECTIVE ESTIMATES AND CHANGES TO THESE ESTIMATES WILL CAUSE THE FAIR VALUES OF OUR STOCK AWARDS AND RELATED STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION EXPENSE\nTHAT WE RECORD TO VARY.\nWE RECORD DEFERRED TAX ASSETS FOR STOCK-BASED AWARDS THAT RESULT IN DEDUCTIONS ON OUR INCOME TAX RETURNS, BASED ON THE\nAMOUNT OF STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION RECOGNIZED AND THE FAIR VALUES ATTRIBUTABLE TO THE VESTED PORTION OF STOCK AWARDS ASSUMED IN CONNECTION WITH A BUSINESS COMBINATION, AT THE STATUTORY TAX RATE IN THE JURISDICTION IN WHICH WE WILL RECEIVE A TAX\nDEDUCTION. BECAUSE THE DEFERRED TAX ASSETS WE RECORD ARE BASED UPON THE STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION EXPENSES IN A PARTICULAR JURISDICTION, THE AFOREMENTIONED INPUTS THAT AFFECT THE FAIR VALUES OF OUR STOCK AWARDS MAY ALSO INDIRECTLY AFFECT OUR INCOME\nTAX EXPENSE. IN ADDITION, DIFFERENCES BETWEEN THE DEFERRED TAX ASSETS RECOGNIZED FOR FINANCIAL REPORTING PURPOSES AND THE ACTUAL TAX DEDUCTION REPORTED ON OUR INCOME TAX RETURNS ARE RECORDED IN ADDITIONAL PAID-IN CAPITAL. IF THE TAX DEDUCTION IS\nLESS THAN THE DEFERRED TAX ASSET, THE CALCULATED SHORTFALL REDUCES OUR POOL OF EXCESS TAX BENEFITS. IF THE POOL OF EXCESS TAX BENEFITS IS REDUCED TO ZERO, THEN SUBSEQUENT SHORTFALLS WOULD INCREASE OUR INCOME TAX EXPENSE. OUR POOL OF EXCESS TAX\nBENEFITS IS COMPUTED IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE ALTERNATIVE TRANSITION METHOD PURSUANT TO ASC 718.\nTO THE EXTENT WE CHANGE THE TERMS OF OUR\nEMPLOYEE STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION PROGRAMS, EXPERIENCE MARKET VOLATILITY IN THE PRICING OF OUR COMMON STOCK THAT INCREASES THE IMPLIED VOLATILITY CALCULATION OF OUR PUBLICLY TRADED, LONGEST-TERM OPTIONS, REFINE DIFFERENT ASSUMPTIONS IN FUTURE\nPERIODS SUCH AS FORFEITURE RATES THAT DIFFER FROM OUR CURRENT ESTIMATES, OR ASSUME STOCK AWARDS FROM ACQUIRED COMPANIES THAT ARE DIFFERENT IN NATURE THAN OUR STOCK AWARD ARRANGEMENTS, AMONGST OTHER POTENTIAL IMPACTS, THE STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION\nEXPENSE THAT WE RECORD IN FUTURE PERIODS AND THE TAX BENEFITS THAT WE REALIZE MAY DIFFER SIGNIFICANTLY FROM WHAT WE HAVE RECORDED IN PREVIOUS REPORTING PERIODS.\nALLOWANCES FOR DOUBTFUL ACCOUNTS\nWE MAKE JUDGMENTS AS TO OUR ABILITY TO COLLECT\nOUTSTANDING RECEIVABLES AND PROVIDE ALLOWANCES FOR THE PORTION OF RECEIVABLES WHEN COLLECTION BECOMES DOUBTFUL. PROVISIONS ARE MADE BASED UPON A SPECIFIC REVIEW OF ALL SIGNIFICANT OUTSTANDING INVOICES. FOR THOSE INVOICES NOT SPECIFICALLY REVIEWED,\nPROVISIONS ARE PROVIDED AT DIFFERING RATES, BASED UPON THE AGE OF THE RECEIVABLE, THE COLLECTION HISTORY ASSOCIATED WITH THE GEOGRAPHIC REGION THAT THE RECEIVABLE WAS RECORDED AND CURRENT ECONOMIC TRENDS. IF THE HISTORICAL DATA WE USE TO CALCULATE\nTHE ALLOWANCES FOR DOUBTFUL ACCOUNTS DOES NOT REFLECT THE FUTURE ABILITY TO COLLECT OUTSTANDING RECEIVABLES, ADDITIONAL PROVISIONS FOR DOUBTFUL ACCOUNTS MAY BE NEEDED AND OUR FUTURE RESULTS OF OPERATIONS COULD BE MATERIALLY AFFECTED.\nRESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nIMPACT OF\nACQUISITIONS\nTHE COMPARABILITY OF OUR OPERATING RESULTS IN FISCAL 2011 COMPARED TO FISCAL 2010 IS IMPACTED BY OUR ACQUISITIONS,\nPRIMARILY THE ACQUISITION OF SUN IN OUR THIRD QUARTER OF FISCAL 2010 AND, TO A LESSER EXTENT, OUR ACQUISITIONS OF ATG DURING THE THIRD QUARTER OF FISCAL 2011 AND PHASE FORWARD DURING THE FIRST QUARTER OF FISCAL 2011.\nTHE COMPARABILITY OF OUR OPERATING RESULTS IN FISCAL 2010 COMPARED TO FISCAL 2009 IS IMPACTED BY OUR ACQUISITIONS, PRIMARILY THE ACQUISITION OF SUN IN OUR\nTHIRD QUARTER OF FISCAL 2010.\nIN OUR DISCUSSION OF CHANGES IN OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS FROM FISCAL 2011 COMPARED TO FISCAL 2010, AND FISCAL\n2010 COMPARED TO FISCAL 2009, WE QUANTIFY THE CONTRIBUTION OF OUR ACQUIRED PRODUCTS TO THE GROWTH IN NEW SOFTWARE LICENSE REVENUES, SOFTWARE LICENSE UPDATES AND PRODUCT SUPPORT REVENUES, HARDWARE SYSTEMS PRODUCTS REVENUES (AS APPLICABLE) AND\nHARDWARE SYSTEMS SUPPORT REVENUES (AS APPLICABLE) FOR THE ONE YEAR PERIOD SUBSEQUENT TO THE ACQUISITION DATE. WE ALSO ARE ABLE TO QUANTIFY THE TOTAL INCREMENTAL EXPENSES ASSOCIATED WITH OUR HARDWARE SYSTEMS PRODUCTS AND HARDWARE SYSTEMS SUPPORT\nOPERATING SEGMENTS. THE INCREMENTAL CONTRIBUTIONS OF OUR OTHER ACQUISITIONS TO OUR OTHER BUSINESSES AND OPERATING SEGMENTS\u0092 REVENUES AND EXPENSES ARE NOT PROVIDED AS THEY EITHER WERE NOT SEPARATELY IDENTIFIABLE DUE TO THE INTEGRATION OF THESE\nOPERATING SEGMENTS INTO OUR EXISTING OPERATIONS AND\/OR WERE INSIGNIFICANT TO OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS DURING THE PERIODS PRESENTED.\n50\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nWE CAUTION READERS THAT, WHILE PRE- AND POST-ACQUISITION COMPARISONS AS WELL AS THE QUANTIFIED AMOUNTS\nTHEMSELVES MAY PROVIDE INDICATIONS OF GENERAL TRENDS, THE ACQUISITION INFORMATION THAT WE PROVIDE HAS INHERENT LIMITATIONS FOR THE FOLLOWING REASONS.\n\u0095\nTHE QUANTIFICATIONS CANNOT ADDRESS THE SUBSTANTIAL EFFECTS ATTRIBUTABLE TO CHANGES IN BUSINESS STRATEGIES, INCLUDING OUR SALES FORCE INTEGRATION\nEFFORTS. WE BELIEVE THAT IF OUR ACQUIRED COMPANIES HAD OPERATED INDEPENDENTLY AND SALES FORCES HAD NOT BEEN INTEGRATED, THE RELATIVE MIX OF PRODUCTS SOLD WOULD HAVE BEEN DIFFERENT; AND\n\u0095\nALTHOUGH SUBSTANTIALLY ALL OF OUR CUSTOMERS, INCLUDING CUSTOMERS FROM ACQUIRED COMPANIES, RENEW THEIR SOFTWARE LICENSE UPDATES AND PRODUCT SUPPORT\nCONTRACTS WHEN THE CONTRACTS ARE ELIGIBLE FOR RENEWAL AND WE STRIVE TO RENEW HARDWARE SYSTEMS SUPPORT CONTRACTS, THE AMOUNTS SHOWN AS SOFTWARE LICENSE UPDATES AND PRODUCT SUPPORT DEFERRED REVENUES AND HARDWARE SYSTEMS SUPPORT DEFERRED REVENUES IN\nOUR SUPPLEMENTAL DISCLOSURE RELATED TO CERTAIN CHARGES (PRESENTED BELOW) ARE NOT NECESSARILY INDICATIVE OF REVENUE IMPROVEMENTS WE WILL ACHIEVE UPON CONTRACT RENEWAL TO THE EXTENT CUSTOMERS DO NOT RENEW.\nCONSTANT CURRENCY PRESENTATION\nOUR INTERNATIONAL OPERATIONS HAVE PROVIDED AND WILL CONTINUE TO PROVIDE A SIGNIFICANT PORTION OF OUR TOTAL REVENUES AND EXPENSES. AS A RESULT, TOTAL\nREVENUES AND EXPENSES WILL CONTINUE TO BE AFFECTED BY CHANGES IN THE U.S. DOLLAR AGAINST MAJOR INTERNATIONAL CURRENCIES. IN ORDER TO PROVIDE A FRAMEWORK FOR ASSESSING HOW OUR UNDERLYING BUSINESSES PERFORMED EXCLUDING THE EFFECT OF FOREIGN\nCURRENCY FLUCTUATIONS, WE COMPARE THE PERCENT CHANGE IN THE RESULTS FROM ONE PERIOD TO ANOTHER PERIOD IN THIS ANNUAL REPORT USING CONSTANT CURRENCY DISCLOSURE. TO PRESENT THIS INFORMATION, CURRENT AND COMPARATIVE PRIOR PERIOD RESULTS FOR ENTITIES\nREPORTING IN CURRENCIES OTHER THAN U.S. DOLLARS ARE CONVERTED INTO U.S. DOLLARS AT CONSTANT EXCHANGE RATES (I.E. THE RATES IN EFFECT ON MAY 31, 2010, WHICH WAS THE LAST DAY OF OUR PRIOR FISCAL YEAR) RATHER THAN THE ACTUAL EXCHANGE RATES IN\nEFFECT DURING THE RESPECTIVE PERIODS. FOR EXAMPLE, IF AN ENTITY REPORTING IN EUROS HAD REVENUES OF 1.0 MILLION EUROS FROM PRODUCTS SOLD ON MAY 31, 2011 AND MAY 31, 2010, OUR FINANCIAL STATEMENTS WOULD REFLECT REPORTED REVENUES OF\n$1.41 MILLION IN FISCAL 2011 (USING 1.41 AS THE MONTH-END AVERAGE EXCHANGE RATE FOR THE PERIOD) AND $1.22 MILLION IN FISCAL 2010 (USING 1.22 AS THE MONTH-END AVERAGE EXCHANGE RATE FOR THE PERIOD). THE CONSTANT CURRENCY PRESENTATION WOULD TRANSLATE\nTHE FISCAL 2011 RESULTS USING THE FISCAL 2010 EXCHANGE RATE AND INDICATE, IN THIS EXAMPLE, NO CHANGE IN REVENUES DURING THE PERIOD. IN EACH OF THE TABLES BELOW, WE PRESENT THE PERCENT CHANGE BASED ON ACTUAL, UNROUNDED RESULTS IN REPORTED CURRENCY\nAND IN CONSTANT CURRENCY.\n51\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nTOTAL REVENUES AND OPERATING EXPENSES\nYEAR ENDED MAY 31,\nPERCENT CHANGE\nPERCENT CHANGE\n(DOLLARS IN MILLIONS)\n2011\nACTUAL\nCONSTANT\n2010\nACTUAL\nCONSTANT\n2009\nTOTAL REVENUES BY GEOGRAPHY.\nAMERICAS\n$18,352\n33%\n32%\n$13,819\n16%\n15%\n$11,900\nEMEA\n(1)\n11,497\n29%\n28%\n8,938\n12%\n13%\n7,948\nASIA PACIFIC\n(2)\n5,773\n42%\n32%\n4,063\n19%\n12%\n3,404\nTOTAL REVENUES\n35,622\n33%\n30%\n26,820\n15%\n14%\n23,252\nTOTAL OPERATING EXPENSES\n23,589\n33%\n31%\n17,758\n19%\n18%\n14,931\nTOTAL OPERATING MARGIN\n$12,033\n33%\n29%\n$9,062\n9%\n6%\n$8,321\nTOTAL OPERATING MARGIN %\n34%\n34%\n36%% REVENUES BY GEOGRAPHY.\nAMERICAS\n52%\n52%\n51%\nEMEA\n32%\n33%\n34%\nASIA PACIFIC\n16%\n15%\n15%\nTOTAL REVENUES BY BUSINESS.\nSOFTWARE\n$24,031\n17%\n15%\n$20,625\n9%\n8%\n$18,877\nHARDWARE SYSTEMS\n6,944\n203%\n195%\n2,290\n*\n*\n\u0097\nSERVICES\n4,647\n19%\n17%\n3,905\n-11%\n-12%\n4,375\nTOTAL REVENUES\n$35,622\n33%\n30%\n$26,820\n15%\n14%\n$23,252% REVENUES BY BUSINESS.\nSOFTWARE\n68%\n77%\n81%\nHARDWARE SYSTEMS\n19%\n9%\n0%\nSERVICES\n13%\n14%\n19%\n(1)\nCOMPRISED OF EUROPE, THE MIDDLE EAST AND AFRICA\n(2)\nASIA PACIFIC INCLUDES JAPAN\n*\nNOT MEANINGFUL\nFISCAL 2011 COMPARED TO\nFISCAL 2010\n.\nOUR TOTAL REVENUES INCREASED IN FISCAL 2011 DUE TO $4.7 BILLION OF INCREMENTAL REVENUE CONTRIBUTION FROM OUR HARDWARE SYSTEMS BUSINESS AND SIGNIFICANT INCREASES IN OUR SOFTWARE AND SERVICES\nBUSINESSES\u0092 REVENUES. OUR TOTAL REVENUES GROWTH ACROSS ALL OF OUR BUSINESSES IN FISCAL 2011 WAS FAVORABLY AFFECTED BY A FULL YEAR OF REVENUE CONTRIBUTIONS FROM SUN AS COMPARED TO OUR FISCAL 2010 OPERATING RESULTS, FOR WHICH SUN\u0092S REVENUE\nCONTRIBUTIONS WERE LIMITED TO ONLY A PORTION OF THE FISCAL 2010 PERIOD. IN ADDITION, OUR SOFTWARE BUSINESS REVENUES INCREASED AS A RESULT OF THE GROWTH IN OUR NEW SOFTWARE LICENSE REVENUES AND OUR SOFTWARE LICENSE UPDATES AND PRODUCT SUPPORT\nREVENUES. EXCLUDING THE EFFECT OF CURRENCY RATE FLUCTUATIONS, THE AMERICAS CONTRIBUTED 55%, EMEA CONTRIBUTED 29% AND APAC CONTRIBUTED 16% TO OUR TOTAL REVENUES GROWTH.\nEXCLUDING THE EFFECT OF FOREIGN CURRENCY RATE FLUCTUATIONS, THE INCREASE IN TOTAL OPERATING EXPENSES IN FISCAL 2011 WAS DUE TO A FULL YEAR OF EXPENSE CONTRIBUTIONS FROM SUN TO OUR FISCAL 2011 OPERATING\nRESULTS, INCLUDING INCREASED EXPENSES PERTAINING TO HARDWARE SYSTEMS PRODUCTS SOLD AND RELATED HARDWARE SYSTEMS SUPPORT OFFERINGS, ADDITIONAL EMPLOYEE RELATED EXPENSES, AND AN INCREASE IN INTANGIBLE ASSET AMORTIZATION. THESE INCREASES WERE PARTIALLY\nOFFSET BY A REDUCTION IN RESTRUCTURING EXPENSES RELATING TO OUR SUN RESTRUCTURING PLAN AND CERTAIN OTHER ORACLE-BASED RESTRUCTURING PLANS, AND WERE ALSO FAVORABLY AFFECTED BY A $120 MILLION BENEFIT RELATED TO THE RECOVERY OF LEGAL COSTS, AND CERTAIN\nOTHER INSURANCE RECOVERIES IN FISCAL 2011.\nON A CONSTANT CURRENCY BASIS, OUR OPERATING MARGIN INCREASED DURING FISCAL 2011 DUE TO OUR TOTAL\nREVENUES GROWTH. OUR OPERATING MARGIN AS A PERCENTAGE OF REVENUES REMAINED FLAT IN FISCAL 2011 AS OUR REVENUES AND EXPENSES GREW AT APPROXIMATELY THE SAME RATES.\n52\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nFISCAL 2010 COMPARED TO FISCAL 2009\n.\nON A\nCONSTANT CURRENCY BASIS, TOTAL REVENUES INCREASED IN FISCAL 2010 DUE TO AN ESTIMATED $2.8 BILLION REVENUE CONTRIBUTION FROM SUN, PRIMARILY IN OUR HARDWARE SYSTEMS BUSINESS, AND AN INCREASE IN OUR TOTAL SOFTWARE REVENUES RESULTING FROM GROWTH IN OUR\nNEW SOFTWARE LICENSES REVENUES AND OUR SOFTWARE LICENSE UPDATES AND PRODUCT SUPPORT REVENUES. THESE INCREASES WERE PARTIALLY OFFSET BY A CONSTANT CURRENCY DECREASE IN OUR TOTAL SERVICES REVENUES THAT WE BELIEVE WAS CAUSED BY WEAKER DEMAND FOR IT\nSERVICES DUE TO THE DETERIORATION IN GLOBAL ECONOMIC CONDITIONS. EXCLUDING THE EFFECT OF CURRENCY RATE FLUCTUATIONS, THE AMERICAS CONTRIBUTED 55%, EMEA CONTRIBUTED 32% AND APAC CONTRIBUTED 13% TO OUR TOTAL REVENUES GROWTH IN FISCAL 2010.\nEXCLUDING THE UNFAVORABLE EFFECT OF CURRENCY RATE FLUCTUATIONS, THE INCREASE IN TOTAL OPERATING EXPENSES IN FISCAL 2010 WAS DUE TO ADDITIONAL OPERATING\nEXPENSES INCURRED AS A RESULT OF OUR ACQUISITION OF SUN AND WERE OF A SIMILAR NATURE AS THOSE NOTED IN THE FISCAL 2011 COMPARED TO FISCAL 2010 DISCUSSION ABOVE. IN ADDITION, WE ALSO INCURRED INCREASED RESTRUCTURING EXPENSES RESULTING FROM OUR SUN\nRESTRUCTURING PLAN AND LEGACY ORACLE-BASED RESTRUCTURING PLANS. THESE INCREASES WERE PARTIALLY OFFSET BY EXPENSE REDUCTIONS IN OUR LEGACY ORACLE-BASED OPERATIONS INCLUDING EXPENSE REDUCTIONS IN OUR SERVICES BUSINESS, REDUCTIONS IN BAD DEBT EXPENSES\nDUE TO IMPROVED COLLECTIONS AND REDUCTIONS TO TRAVEL EXPENSES DUE TO COST MANAGEMENT INITIATIVES.\nON A CONSTANT CURRENCY BASIS, OUR OPERATING\nMARGIN INCREASED DURING FISCAL 2010 DUE TO HIGHER REVENUES FROM OUR SOFTWARE BUSINESS, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY POST-COMBINATION OPERATING LOSSES FROM SUN THAT RELATED TO AMORTIZATION OF INTANGIBLE ASSETS, ACQUISITION RELATED AND OTHER EXPENSES AND\nRESTRUCTURING EXPENSES.

WE ALSO USE CASH TO INVEST IN CAPITAL AND OTHER ASSETS TO SUPPORT OUR GROWTH.\nFISCAL 2011 COMPARED TO FISCAL 2010.\nNET CASH USED FOR INVESTING ACTIVITIES DECREASED IN FISCAL 2011 DUE TO A DECREASE IN\nCASH USED FOR ACQUISITIONS, NET OF CASH ACQUIRED (REFER TO NOTE 2 OF NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS INCLUDED ELSEWHERE IN THIS ANNUAL REPORT FOR ADDITIONAL INFORMATION REGARDING OUR ACQUISITIONS) AND A DECREASE IN CASH USED TO PURCHASE\nMARKETABLE SECURITIES (NET OF PROCEEDS RECEIVED FROM SALES AND MATURITIES), PARTIALLY OFFSET BY AN INCREASE IN NET CAPITAL EXPENDITURES.\nFISCAL 2010 COMPARED TO FISCAL 2009.\nNET CASH USED FOR INVESTING ACTIVITIES INCREASED IN FISCAL 2010 DUE TO AN INCREASE IN\nCASH USED FOR ACQUISITIONS, PRIMARILY OUR ACQUISITION OF SUN, AND AN INCREASE IN CASH USED TO PURCHASE MARKETABLE DEBT SECURITIES (NET OF PROCEEDS RECEIVED FROM SALES AND MATURITIES).\nCASH FLOWS FROM FINANCING ACTIVITIES.\nTHE CHANGES IN CASH FLOWS FROM FINANCING ACTIVITIES PRIMARILY RELATE TO BORROWINGS AND PAYMENTS UNDER DEBT FACILITIES AS WELL AS\nSTOCK REPURCHASES, DIVIDEND PAYMENTS AND PROCEEDS FROM STOCK OPTION EXERCISES.\nFISCAL 2011 COMPARED TO FISCAL\n2010.\nNET CASH PROVIDED BY FINANCING ACTIVITIES IN FISCAL 2011 DECREASED DUE TO A REDUCTION IN THE AMOUNT OF DEBT THAT WE ISSUED IN FISCAL 2011 ($1.15 BILLION BORROWED PURSUANT TO OUR REVOLVING CREDIT FACILITIES AND $3.25\nBILLION OF LONG-TERM SENIOR NOTES ISSUED) IN COMPARISON TO FISCAL 2010 ($4.5 BILLION OF LONG-TERM SENIOR NOTES AND $2.8 BILLION OF COMMERCIAL PAPER NOTES ISSUED). THIS UNFAVORABLE IMPACT TO OUR FINANCING CASH FLOWS WAS PARTIALLY OFFSET BY A CASH\nFAVORABLE REDUCTION IN DEBT REPAYMENTS DURING FISCAL 2011 (REPAYMENTS OF $2.25 BILLION OF SENIOR NOTES IN JANUARY 2011 AND $881 MILLION OF COMMERCIAL PAPER NOTES) IN COMPARISON TO FISCAL 2010 (REPAYMENTS OF $1.9 BILLION OF COMMERCIAL PAPER NOTES,\n$1.0 BILLION OF FLOATING RATE SENIOR NOTES AND $700 MILLION OF SUN\u0092S LEGACY CONVERTIBLE NOTES) AND AN INCREASE IN PROCEEDS FROM STOCK OPTION EXERCISES DURING FISCAL 2011.\nFISCAL 2010 COMPARED TO FISCAL 2009.\nNET CASH PROVIDED BY FINANCING ACTIVITIES IN FISCAL 2010 INCREASED COMPARED TO CASH USED BY FINANCING ACTIVITIES IN FISCAL 2009 DUE TO\nOUR ISSUANCE OF $4.5 BILLION OF SENIOR NOTES, OUR ISSUANCES OF $2.8 BILLION OF COMMERCIAL PAPER NOTES, NET OF REPAYMENTS, AND A SIGNIFICANT REDUCTION IN OUR COMMON STOCK REPURCHASES. THESE FISCAL 2010 INCREASES IN CASH FLOWS FROM FINANCING\nACTIVITIES WERE PARTIALLY OFFSET BY ADDITIONAL CASH USED FOR FISCAL 2010 DIVIDEND PAYMENTS AND THE FISCAL 2010 REPAYMENT OF $700 MILLION OF SUN\u0092S LEGACY CONVERTIBLE NOTES.\nFREE CASH FLOW.\nTO SUPPLEMENT OUR STATEMENTS OF CASH FLOWS PRESENTED ON A GAAP BASIS, WE USE NON-GAAP MEASURES OF CASH FLOWS ON A TRAILING 4-QUARTER BASIS TO ANALYZE\nCASH FLOWS GENERATED FROM OUR OPERATIONS. WE BELIEVE FREE CASH FLOW IS ALSO USEFUL AS ONE OF THE BASES FOR COMPARING OUR PERFORMANCE WITH OUR COMPETITORS. THE PRESENTATION OF NON-GAAP FREE CASH FLOW IS NOT MEANT TO BE CONSIDERED IN ISOLATION OR AS\nAN ALTERNATIVE TO NET INCOME AS AN INDICATOR OF OUR PERFORMANCE, OR AS AN ALTERNATIVE TO CASH FLOWS FROM OPERATING ACTIVITIES AS A MEASURE OF LIQUIDITY.

THE 2011 CREDIT AGREEMENTS PROVIDED US WITH\nSHORT-TERM BORROWINGS FOR WORKING CAPITAL AND OTHER GENERAL CORPORATE PURPOSES.

IN JANUARY 2011, OUR 5.00% FIXED RATE SENIOR NOTES FOR $2.25 BILLION MATURED AND WERE REPAID. IN JULY 2010, WE ISSUED $3.25 BILLION OF FIXED RATE SENIOR NOTES COMPRISED OF $1.0 BILLION OF 3.875% NOTES DUE JULY 2020 AND $2.25\nBILLION OF 5.375% NOTES DUE JULY 2040. WE ISSUED THESE SENIOR NOTES IN ORDER TO REPAY INDEBTEDNESS, INCLUDING THE REPAYMENT OF OUR $2.25 BILLION OF SENIOR NOTES THAT MATURED IN JANUARY 2011, FOR GENERAL CORPORATE PURPOSES, FOR FUTURE ACQUISITIONS\nAND IN ORDER TO REPLENISH CASH USED TO REPAY $1.0 BILLION OF THE FLOATING RATE SENIOR NOTES THAT MATURED IN MAY 2010. ADDITIONAL DETAILS REGARDING THESE SENIOR NOTES AND ALL OTHER BORROWINGS ARE INCLUDED IN NOTE 8 OF NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL\nSTATEMENTS INCLUDED ELSEWHERE IN THIS ANNUAL REPORT.\nCOMMERCIAL PAPER NOTES\n:    DURING FISCAL 2011, WE REPAID $881\nMILLION OF COMMERCIAL PAPER NOTES THAT WERE ISSUED IN FISCAL 2010 PURSUANT TO OUR COMMERCIAL PAPER PROGRAM, WHICH ALLOWS US TO ISSUE AND SELL UNSECURED SHORT-TERM PROMISSORY NOTES PURSUANT TO A PRIVATE PLACEMENT EXEMPTION FROM THE REGISTRATION\nREQUIREMENTS UNDER FEDERAL AND STATE SECURITIES LAWS. AS OF MAY 31, 2011, WE HAD NO COMMERCIAL PAPER NOTES OUTSTANDING ($881 MILLION OUTSTANDING AS OF MAY 31, 2010).\nOUR ABILITY TO ISSUE COMMERCIAL PAPER NOTES IN THE FUTURE IS HIGHLY DEPENDENT UPON OUR ABILITY TO PROVIDE A BACK-STOP BY MEANS OF A REVOLVING CREDIT FACILITY OR OTHER DEBT FACILITY FOR AMOUNTS EQUAL TO OR\nGREATER THAN THE AMOUNTS OF COMMERCIAL PAPER NOTES WE INTEND TO ISSUE. WHILE PRESENTLY WE HAVE NO SUCH FACILITIES IN PLACE THAT MAY PROVIDE A BACK-STOP TO SUCH COMMERCIAL PAPER NOTES, WE CURRENTLY BELIEVE THAT, IF NEEDED, WE COULD PUT IN PLACE ONE\nOR MORE ADDITIONAL REVOLVING CREDIT OR SIMILAR DEBT FACILITIES IN A TIMELY MANNER AND ON COMMERCIALLY REASONABLE TERMS.\nCOMMON STOCK\nREPURCHASES\n:    OUR BOARD OF DIRECTORS HAS APPROVED A PROGRAM FOR US TO REPURCHASE SHARES OF OUR COMMON STOCK. ON OCTOBER 20, 2008, WE ANNOUNCED THAT OUR BOARD OF DIRECTORS EXPANDED OUR REPURCHASE PROGRAM BY $8.0 BILLION\nAND AS OF MAY 31, 2011, $4.1 BILLION WAS AVAILABLE FOR SHARE REPURCHASES PURSUANT TO OUR STOCK REPURCHASE PROGRAM. WE REPURCHASED 40.4 MILLION SHARES FOR $1.2 BILLION, 43.3 MILLION SHARES FOR $1.0 BILLION AND 225.6 MILLION SHARES\nFOR $4.0 BILLION IN FISCAL 2011, 2010 AND 2009, RESPECTIVELY. OUR STOCK REPURCHASE AUTHORIZATION DOES NOT HAVE AN EXPIRATION DATE AND THE PACE OF OUR REPURCHASE ACTIVITY WILL DEPEND ON FACTORS SUCH\n70\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nAS OUR WORKING CAPITAL NEEDS, OUR CASH REQUIREMENTS FOR ACQUISITIONS AND DIVIDEND REPAYMENTS, OUR DEBT REPAYMENT OBLIGATIONS (DESCRIBED FURTHER BELOW), OUR STOCK PRICE, AND ECONOMIC AND MARKET\nCONDITIONS.

OUR STOCK REPURCHASE PROGRAM MAY BE ACCELERATED, SUSPENDED, DELAYED OR DISCONTINUED AT ANY TIME.\nCASH DIVIDENDS\n:    IN FISCAL 2011, WE DECLARED AND PAID CASH DIVIDENDS OF $0.21 PER SHARE THAT TOTALED $1.1 BILLION. IN JUNE\n2011, OUR BOARD OF DIRECTORS DECLARED A QUARTERLY CASH DIVIDEND OF $0.06 PER SHARE OF OUTSTANDING COMMON STOCK PAYABLE ON AUGUST 3, 2011 TO STOCKHOLDERS OF RECORD AS OF THE CLOSE OF BUSINESS ON JULY 13, 2011.

WE\n71\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nUTILIZE SEVERAL EXTERNAL MANUFACTURERS TO MANUFACTURE SUB-ASSEMBLIES FOR OUR PRODUCTS AND TO PERFORM FINAL ASSEMBLY AND TESTING OF FINISHED PRODUCTS. WE ALSO OBTAIN INDIVIDUAL COMPONENTS FOR OUR\nPRODUCTS FROM A VARIETY OF INDIVIDUAL SUPPLIERS BASED ON PROJECTED DEMAND INFORMATION. SUCH PURCHASE COMMITMENTS ARE BASED ON OUR FORECASTED COMPONENT AND MANUFACTURING REQUIREMENTS AND TYPICALLY PROVIDE FOR FULFILLMENT WITHIN AGREED UPON LEAD-TIMES\nAND\/OR COMMERCIALLY STANDARD LEAD-TIMES FOR THE PARTICULAR PART OR PRODUCT AND HAVE BEEN INCLUDED IN THE AMOUNT PRESENTED IN THE ABOVE CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS TABLE. ROUTINE ARRANGEMENTS FOR OTHER MATERIALS AND GOODS THAT ARE NOT RELATED TO OUR\nEXTERNAL MANUFACTURERS AND CERTAIN OTHER SUPPLIERS AND THAT ARE ENTERED INTO IN THE ORDINARY COURSE OF BUSINESS ARE NOT INCLUDED IN THIS AMOUNT AS THEY ARE GENERALLY ENTERED INTO IN ORDER TO SECURE PRICING OR OTHER NEGOTIATED TERMS AND ARE DIFFICULT\nTO QUANTIFY IN A MEANINGFUL WAY.\nAS OF MAY 31, 2011, WE HAVE $3.8 BILLION OF GROSS UNRECOGNIZED TAX BENEFITS, INCLUDING\nRELATED INTEREST AND PENALTIES, RECORDED ON OUR CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEET AND ALL SUCH OBLIGATIONS HAVE BEEN EXCLUDED FROM THE TABLE ABOVE DUE TO THE UNCERTAINTY AS TO WHEN THEY MIGHT BE SETTLED. WE HAVE REACHED CERTAIN SETTLEMENT AGREEMENTS WITH\nRELEVANT TAXING AUTHORITIES TO PAY APPROXIMATELY $96 MILLION OF THESE LIABILITIES. ALTHOUGH IT REMAINS UNCLEAR AS TO WHEN PAYMENTS PURSUANT TO THESE AGREEMENTS WILL BE MADE, SOME OR ALL MAY BE MADE IN FISCAL 2012. WE CANNOT MAKE A REASONABLY\nRELIABLE ESTIMATE OF THE PERIOD IN WHICH THE REMAINDER OF OUR UNRECOGNIZED TAX BENEFITS WILL BE SETTLED OR RELEASED WITH THE RELEVANT TAX AUTHORITIES, ALTHOUGH WE BELIEVE IT IS REASONABLY POSSIBLE THAT CERTAIN OF THESE LIABILITIES COULD BE SETTLED\nOR RELEASED DURING FISCAL 2012.\nSUBSEQUENT TO FISCAL 2011, WE AGREED TO ACQUIRE CERTAIN COMPANIES FOR AMOUNTS THAT ARE NOT MATERIAL TO OUR\nBUSINESS. WE EXPECT TO CLOSE SUCH ACQUISITIONS WITHIN THE NEXT TWELVE MONTHS.\nWE BELIEVE THAT OUR CURRENT CASH, CASH EQUIVALENTS AND\nMARKETABLE SECURITIES AND CASH GENERATED FROM OPERATIONS WILL BE SUFFICIENT TO MEET OUR WORKING CAPITAL, CAPITAL EXPENDITURES AND CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATION REQUIREMENTS. IN ADDITION, WE BELIEVE WE COULD FUND ANY FUTURE ACQUISITIONS, DIVIDEND PAYMENTS\nAND REPURCHASES OF COMMON STOCK OR DEBT WITH OUR INTERNALLY AVAILABLE CASH, CASH EQUIVALENTS AND MARKETABLE SECURITIES, CASH GENERATED FROM OPERATIONS, ADDITIONAL BORROWINGS OR FROM THE ISSUANCE OF ADDITIONAL SECURITIES.\nOFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS.\nWE DO NOT HAVE ANY OFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS THAT HAVE OR ARE REASONABLY LIKELY\nTO HAVE A CURRENT OR FUTURE EFFECT ON OUR FINANCIAL CONDITION, CHANGES IN FINANCIAL CONDITION, REVENUES OR EXPENSES, RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, LIQUIDITY, CAPITAL EXPENDITURES OR CAPITAL RESOURCES THAT ARE MATERIAL TO INVESTORS.\nSELECTED QUARTERLY FINANCIAL DATA\nQUARTERLY REVENUES, EXPENSES AND OPERATING INCOME HAVE HISTORICALLY BEEN AFFECTED BY A VARIETY OF SEASONAL FACTORS, INCLUDING SALES FORCE INCENTIVE\nCOMPENSATION PLANS. IN ADDITION, OUR EUROPEAN OPERATIONS GENERALLY PROVIDE LOWER REVENUES IN OUR FIRST FISCAL QUARTER BECAUSE OF THE REDUCED ECONOMIC ACTIVITY IN EUROPE DURING THE SUMMER. THESE SEASONAL FACTORS ARE COMMON IN THE HIGH TECHNOLOGY\nINDUSTRY. THESE FACTORS HAVE CAUSED A DECREASE IN OUR FIRST QUARTER REVENUES AS COMPARED TO REVENUES IN THE IMMEDIATELY PRECEDING FOURTH QUARTER, WHICH HISTORICALLY HAS BEEN OUR HIGHEST REVENUE QUARTER WITHIN A PARTICULAR FISCAL YEAR. SIMILARLY, THE\nOPERATING INCOME OF OUR BUSINESS IS AFFECTED BY SEASONAL FACTORS IN A CONSISTENT MANNER AS OUR REVENUES (IN PARTICULAR, OUR NEW SOFTWARE LICENSE AND HARDWARE SYSTEMS PRODUCTS) AS CERTAIN EXPENSES WITHIN OUR COST STRUCTURE ARE RELATIVELY FIXED IN THE\nSHORT-TERM. WE EXPECT THESE TRENDS TO CONTINUE IN FISCAL 2012. OUR QUARTERLY REVENUES, EXPENSES AND OPERATING INCOME WERE ALSO IMPACTED IN THE PERIODS PRESENTED IN THE TABLE BELOW BY OUR ACQUISITION OF SUN DURING THE THIRD QUARTER OF FISCAL 2010,\nWHICH ADDED A SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT OF REVENUES AND EXPENSES TO OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS IN COMPARISON TO OUR HISTORICAL OPERATING RESULTS.\n72\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nTHE FOLLOWING TABLES SET FORTH SELECTED UNAUDITED QUARTERLY INFORMATION FOR OUR LAST EIGHT FISCAL QUARTERS.\nWE BELIEVE THAT ALL NECESSARY ADJUSTMENTS, WHICH CONSISTED ONLY OF NORMAL RECURRING ADJUSTMENTS, HAVE BEEN INCLUDED IN THE AMOUNTS STATED BELOW TO PRESENT FAIRLY THE RESULTS OF SUCH PERIODS WHEN READ IN CONJUNCTION WITH THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL\nSTATEMENTS AND RELATED NOTES INCLUDED ELSEWHERE IN THIS ANNUAL REPORT.

IN THE SECOND QUARTER OF FISCAL 2011, OUR STOCKHOLDERS APPROVED AMENDMENTS TO THE AMENDED AND RESTATED ORACLE CORPORATION 2000 LONG-TERM EQUITY INCENTIVE PLAN, INCLUDING AN AMENDMENT TO INCREASE THE NUMBER OF SHARES AVAILABLE\nUNDER THE PLAN BY 388,313,015 SHARES. WE HISTORICALLY HAVE GRANTED ONLY STOCK OPTIONS TO OUR EMPLOYEES. THE RESTRICTED STOCK-BASED AWARDS INCLUDED IN THE TABLE PRESENTED BELOW WERE ASSUMED AS A RESULT OF OUR ACQUISITIONS.\nWE RECOGNIZE THAT OPTIONS AND RESTRICTED STOCK-BASED AWARDS DILUTE EXISTING STOCKHOLDERS AND HAVE SOUGHT TO CONTROL THE NUMBER OF OPTIONS AND RESTRICTED\nSTOCK-BASED AWARDS GRANTED WHILE PROVIDING COMPETITIVE COMPENSATION PACKAGES. CONSISTENT WITH THESE DUAL GOALS, OUR CUMULATIVE POTENTIAL DILUTION SINCE JUNE 1, 2008 HAS BEEN A WEIGHTED AVERAGE ANNUALIZED RATE OF 1.3% PER YEAR. THE\nPOTENTIAL DILUTION PERCENTAGE IS CALCULATED AS THE AVERAGE ANNUALIZED NEW OPTIONS OR RESTRICTED STOCK-BASED AWARDS GRANTED AND ASSUMED, NET OF OPTIONS AND RESTRICTED STOCK-BASED AWARDS FORFEITED BY EMPLOYEES LEAVING THE COMPANY, DIVIDED BY THE\nWEIGHTED AVERAGE OUTSTANDING SHARES DURING THE CALCULATION PERIOD. THIS MAXIMUM POTENTIAL DILUTION WILL ONLY RESULT IF ALL OPTIONS ARE EXERCISED AND RESTRICTED STOCK-BASED AWARDS VEST. SOME OF THE OUTSTANDING OPTIONS, WHICH GENERALLY HAVE A 10 YEAR\nEXERCISE PERIOD, HAVE EXERCISE PRICES HIGHER THAN THE CURRENT MARKET PRICE OF OUR COMMON STOCK. AT MAY 31, 2011, 1.8% OF OUR OUTSTANDING STOCK OPTIONS HAD EXERCISE PRICES IN EXCESS OF THE CURRENT MARKET PRICE. IN RECENT YEARS, OUR STOCK\nREPURCHASE PROGRAM HAS MORE THAN OFFSET THE DILUTIVE EFFECT OF OUR STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION PROGRAM; HOWEVER, WE MAY REDUCE THE LEVEL OF OUR STOCK REPURCHASES IN THE FUTURE AS WE MAY USE OUR AVAILABLE CASH FOR ACQUISITIONS, TO PAY DIVIDENDS, TO\nREPAY OR REPURCHASE INDEBTEDNESS OR FOR OTHER PURPOSES. AT MAY 31, 2011, THE MAXIMUM POTENTIAL DILUTION FROM ALL OUTSTANDING AND UNEXERCISED STOCK OPTION AND RESTRICTED STOCK-BASED AWARDS, REGARDLESS OF WHEN GRANTED AND REGARDLESS OF WHETHER\nVESTED OR UNVESTED AND INCLUDING OPTIONS WHERE THE STRIKE PRICE IS HIGHER THAN THE CURRENT MARKET PRICE, WAS 7.0%.\n73\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nTHE COMPENSATION COMMITTEE OF THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS REVIEWS AND APPROVES THE ORGANIZATION-WIDE STOCK OPTION\nGRANTS TO SELECTED EMPLOYEES, ALL STOCK OPTION GRANTS TO EXECUTIVE OFFICERS AND ANY INDIVIDUAL STOCK OPTION GRANTS IN EXCESS OF 100,000 SHARES.

THIS ONGOING TREND IS INCREASING THE CAPABILITIES OF PCS, MOBILE, AND OTHER DEVICES POWERED BY RICH SOFTWARE PLATFORMS AND APPLICATIONS.\nAT THE SAME TIME, THE INFORMATION AND SERVICES PEOPLE USE INCREASINGLY SPAN MULTIPLE DEVICES. USER EXPERIENCES WILL BE TRANSFORMED BY THE ADOPTION OF CLOUD COMPUTING WHEN BROUGHT TOGETHER WITH THE RICHNESS OF SMART, CONNECTED DEVICES. MICROSOFT IS\nDELIVERING EXPERIENCES THAT SEAMLESSLY CONNECT PCS AND MOBILE AND OTHER DEVICES THROUGH THE CLOUD. WE ARE DEVOTING SIGNIFICANT RESOURCES TO CONSUMER CLOUD OFFERINGS LIKE BING, WINDOWS LIVE, AND XBOX LIVE. OUR SOFTWARE AND HARDWARE PLATFORM\nINVESTMENTS CAN BE SEEN IN PRODUCTS LIKE KINECT, WINDOWS, WINDOWS AZURE, WINDOWS PHONE, WINDOWS SERVER, AND XBOX.\nCLOUD COMPUTING TRANSFORMING THE\nDATA CENTER AND INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY\nCLOUD-BASED SOLUTIONS PROVIDE CUSTOMERS WITH SOFTWARE, SERVICES AND CONTENT OVER THE\nINTERNET BY WAY OF SHARED COMPUTING RESOURCES LOCATED IN CENTRALIZED DATA CENTERS. COMPUTING IS UNDERGOING A LONG-TERM SHIFT FROM CLIENT\/SERVER TO THE CLOUD, A SHIFT SIMILAR IN IMPORTANCE AND IMPACT TO THE TRANSITION FROM MAINFRAME TO CLIENT\/SERVER.\nTHE SHIFT TO THE CLOUD IS DRIVEN BY THREE IMPORTANT ECONOMIES OF SCALE: LARGER DATA CENTERS CAN DEPLOY COMPUTATIONAL RESOURCES AT SIGNIFICANTLY LOWER COST THAN SMALLER ONES; LARGER DATA CENTERS INCLUDE DIVERSE CUSTOMER, GEOGRAPHIC, AND APPLICATION\nDEMAND PATTERNS WHICH IMPROVE THE UTILIZATION OF COMPUTING, STORAGE, AND NETWORK RESOURCES; AND MULTI-TENANCY LOWERS APPLICATION MAINTENANCE LABOR COSTS FOR LARGE PUBLIC CLOUDS. AS A RESULT OF THE IMPROVED ECONOMICS, THE CLOUD OFFERS UNIQUE LEVELS\nOF ELASTICITY AND AGILITY THAT WILL ENABLE NEW SOLUTIONS AND APPLICATIONS. FOR BUSINESSES OF ALL SIZES, THE CLOUD CREATES THE OPPORTUNITY TO FOCUS MORE ON INNOVATION WHILE LEAVING NON-DIFFERENTIATING ACTIVITIES TO RELIABLE AND COST-EFFECTIVE\nPROVIDERS. FOR MOST BUSINESSES, THE FIRST STEP IN ACHIEVING CLOUD ECONOMICS IS THE ADOPTION OF VIRTUALIZATION IN THEIR DATA CENTER. WE ARE DEVOTING SIGNIFICANT RESOURCES TO DEVELOPING CLOUD INFRASTRUCTURE, PLATFORMS, AND APPLICATIONS INCLUDING\nOFFERINGS SUCH AS MICROSOFT DYNAMICS ONLINE, MICROSOFT SQL AZURE, OFFICE 365, WINDOWS AZURE, WINDOWS INTUNE, AND WINDOWS SERVER.\nENTERTAINMENT\nTHE EVOLUTION OF HARDWARE, SOFTWARE, SERVICES, AND THE CLOUD ARE ENHANCING THE DELIVERY AND QUALITY OF UNIFIED ENTERTAINMENT\nEXPERIENCES ACROSS MANY DEVICES. THESE RICH MEDIA EXPERIENCES INCLUDE GAMES, MOVIES, MUSIC, TELEVISION, AND SOCIAL INTERACTIONS WITH FAMILY, FRIENDS, AND COLLEAGUES. AT MICROSOFT, OUR APPROACH IS TO SIMPLIFY AND INCREASE THE ACCESSIBILITY OF THESE\nENTERTAINMENT EXPERIENCES TO BROADEN MARKET PENETRATION OF OUR SOFTWARE AND SERVICES. WE INVEST SIGNIFICANT RESOURCES IN PARTNERSHIPS, CONTENT, WINDOWS PHONE, XBOX, AND XBOX LIVE.\nSEARCH\nOVER THE LAST TWO DECADES, WEB CONTENT AND SOCIAL CONNECTIONS HAVE INCREASED\nDRAMATICALLY AS PEOPLE SPEND MORE TIME ONLINE, WHILE DISCOVERABILITY AND ACCESSIBILITY HAS BEEN TRANSFORMING FROM DIRECT NAVIGATION AND DOCUMENT LINKS. THERE IS SIGNIFICANT OPPORTUNITY TO DELIVER DIFFERENTIATED PRODUCTS THAT HELPS USERS MAKE BETTER\nDECISIONS AND\n23\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nPART II\nITEM 7\nCOMPLETE TASKS MORE SIMPLY WHEN USING PC, MOBILE, AND OTHER DEVICES. OUR APPROACH IS TO USE MACHINE LEARNING TO TRY TO UNDERSTAND USER INTENT, AND DIFFERENTIATE OUR PRODUCT BY FOCUSING ON THE\nINTEGRATION OF VISUAL, SOCIAL, AND OTHER ELEMENTS WHICH SIMPLIFIES PEOPLE\u0092S INTERACTION WITH THE INTERNET. WE INVEST SIGNIFICANT RESOURCES IN BING, SHAREPOINT, WINDOWS, AND WINDOWS PHONE.\nCOMMUNICATIONS AND PRODUCTIVITY\nPERSONAL\nAND BUSINESS PRODUCTIVITY HAS BEEN TRANSFORMED BY THE UBIQUITY OF COMPUTING AND SOFTWARE TOOLS. OVER THE LAST DECADE, MICROSOFT REDEFINED SOFTWARE PRODUCTIVITY BEYOND THE RICH OFFICE CLIENT ON THE PC. PRODUCTIVITY SCENARIOS NOW ENCOMPASS UNIFIED\nCOMMUNICATIONS, BUSINESS INTELLIGENCE, COLLABORATION, CONTENT MANAGEMENT, AND RELATIONSHIP MANAGEMENT, WHICH ARE INCREASINGLY POWERED BY SERVER-SIDE APPLICATIONS. THESE SERVER APPLICATIONS CAN BE HOSTED BY THE CUSTOMER, A PARTNER, OR BY MICROSOFT IN\nTHE CLOUD. THERE ARE SIGNIFICANT OPPORTUNITIES TO PROVIDE PRODUCTIVITY AND COMMUNICATION SCENARIOS ACROSS PCS, MOBILE DEVICES, AND OTHER DEVICES THAT CONNECT TO SERVICES. WE INVEST SIGNIFICANT RESOURCES IN DYNAMICS, EXCHANGE, LYNC, OFFICE, OFFICE\n365, SHAREPOINT, AND WINDOWS LIVE.\nECONOMIC CONDITIONS, CHALLENGES AND RISKS\nAS DISCUSSED ABOVE, OUR INDUSTRY IS DYNAMIC AND HIGHLY COMPETITIVE. WE MUST ANTICIPATE CHANGES IN TECHNOLOGY AND BUSINESS MODELS. OUR MODEL FOR\nGROWTH IS BASED ON OUR ABILITY TO INITIATE AND EMBRACE DISRUPTIVE TECHNOLOGY TRENDS, TO ENTER NEW MARKETS, BOTH IN TERMS OF GEOGRAPHIES AND PRODUCT AREAS, AND TO DRIVE BROAD ADOPTION OF THE PRODUCTS AND SERVICES WE DEVELOP AND MARKET.\nAT MICROSOFT, WE PRIORITIZE OUR INVESTMENTS AMONG THE HIGHEST LONG-TERM GROWTH OPPORTUNITIES. THESE INVESTMENTS REQUIRE SIGNIFICANT RESOURCES AND\nARE MULTI-YEAR IN NATURE. THE PRODUCTS AND SERVICES WE BRING TO MARKET CAN BE BUILT INTERNALLY, BROUGHT TO MARKET AS PART OF A PARTNERSHIP OR ALLIANCE, OR THROUGH ACQUISITION.\nOUR SUCCESS IS HIGHLY DEPENDENT ON OUR ABILITY TO ATTRACT AND RETAIN QUALIFIED EMPLOYEES.

NET GAINS FROM FOREIGN\nCURRENCY REMEASUREMENTS WERE INSIGNIFICANT IN FISCAL YEAR 2010 COMPARED TO NET LOSSES OF $509 MILLION IN THE PRIOR YEAR, WHICH HAD RESULTED FROM THE STRENGTHENING OF THE U.S. DOLLAR IN THE PRIOR YEAR.

OUR EFFECTIVE TAX RATE WAS LOWER THAN THE U.S. FEDERAL STATUTORY RATE AND OUR PRIOR YEAR EFFECTIVE RATE PRIMARILY\nDUE TO A HIGHER MIX OF EARNINGS TAXED AT LOWER RATES IN FOREIGN JURISDICTIONS RESULTING FROM PRODUCING AND DISTRIBUTING OUR PRODUCTS AND SERVICES THROUGH OUR FOREIGN REGIONAL OPERATIONS CENTERS IN IRELAND, SINGAPORE, AND PUERTO RICO, WHICH ARE\nSUBJECT TO\n33\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nPART II\nITEM 7\nLOWER INCOME TAX RATES.

IN FISCAL YEARS\n2011 AND 2010, THE REDUCTION OF THE U.S. FEDERAL STATUTORY RATE AS A RESULT OF FOREIGN EARNINGS TAXED AT LOWER RATES WAS 16% AND 12%, RESPECTIVELY.\nIN ADDITION, OUR EFFECTIVE TAX RATE WAS LOWER THAN IN THE PRIOR YEAR DUE TO A PARTIAL SETTLEMENT WITH THE I.R.S. IN THE THIRD QUARTER OF FISCAL YEAR 2011 RELATING TO THE AUDIT OF TAX YEARS 2004 TO 2006. THIS\nPARTIAL SETTLEMENT REDUCED OUR INCOME TAX EXPENSE FOR FISCAL YEAR 2011 BY $461 MILLION.\nTAX CONTINGENCIES AND OTHER TAX LIABILITIES\nWERE $7.4 BILLION AND $6.9 BILLION AS OF JUNE 30, 2011 AND 2010, RESPECTIVELY, AND ARE INCLUDED IN OTHER LONG-TERM LIABILITIES. WE HAVE NOT PROVIDED DEFERRED U.S. INCOME TAXES OR FOREIGN WITHHOLDING TAXES ON TEMPORARY DIFFERENCES OF\nAPPROXIMATELY $44.8 BILLION RESULTING FROM EARNINGS FOR CERTAIN NON-U.S. SUBSIDIARIES BECAUSE THEY ARE PERMANENTLY REINVESTED OUTSIDE THE U.S. THE UNRECOGNIZED DEFERRED TAX LIABILITY ASSOCIATED WITH THESE TEMPORARY DIFFERENCES WAS APPROXIMATELY\n$14.2 BILLION AS OF JUNE 30, 2011.\nWHILE WE SETTLED A PORTION OF THE I.R.S.

COMPLETED ITS EXAMINATION AND ISSUED A REVENUE AGENT\u0092S REPORT (\u0093RAR\u0094) FOR THE REMAINING UNRESOLVED ITEMS. WE\nDO NOT AGREE WITH THE ADJUSTMENTS IN THE RAR, AND WE HAVE FILED A PROTEST TO INITIATE THE ADMINISTRATIVE APPEALS PROCESS. THE PROPOSED ADJUSTMENTS ARE PRIMARILY RELATED TO TRANSFER PRICING AND COULD HAVE A SIGNIFICANT IMPACT ON OUR FINANCIAL\nSTATEMENTS IF NOT RESOLVED FAVORABLY; HOWEVER, WE BELIEVE OUR EXISTING RESERVES ARE ADEQUATE. WE DO NOT BELIEVE IT IS REASONABLY POSSIBLE THAT THE TOTAL AMOUNT OF UNRECOGNIZED TAX BENEFITS WILL SIGNIFICANTLY INCREASE OR DECREASE WITHIN THE NEXT 12\nMONTHS, AS WE DO NOT BELIEVE THE APPEALS PROCESS WILL BE CONCLUDED WITHIN THE NEXT 12 MONTHS.

IN FISCAL YEARS 2010 AND 2009, THE REDUCTION TO THE U.S. FEDERAL STATUTORY RATE AS A RESULT OF FOREIGN EARNINGS TAXED AT LOWER RATES WAS 12% AND 9%, RESPECTIVELY, REFLECTING THE MIX OF U.S. AND\nINTERNATIONAL INCOME BEFORE INCOME TAXES AND THE IMPACT OF CHANGES IN UNRECOGNIZED TAX BENEFITS RELATED TO INTERNATIONAL INCOME.

EQUITY AND OTHER INVESTMENTS WERE $10.9 BILLION AS OF JUNE 30, 2011, COMPARED WITH $7.8 BILLION AS OF JUNE 30, 2010. OUR SHORT-TERM INVESTMENTS ARE PRIMARILY TO FACILITATE\nLIQUIDITY AND FOR CAPITAL PRESERVATION. THEY CONSIST PREDOMINANTLY OF HIGHLY LIQUID INVESTMENT-GRADE FIXED-INCOME SECURITIES, DIVERSIFIED AMONG INDUSTRIES AND INDIVIDUAL ISSUERS. THE INVESTMENTS ARE PREDOMINANTLY U.S. DOLLAR-DENOMINATED SECURITIES,\nBUT ALSO INCLUDE FOREIGN CURRENCY-DENOMINATED SECURITIES IN ORDER TO DIVERSIFY RISK. OUR FIXED-INCOME INVESTMENTS ARE EXPOSED TO INTEREST RATE RISK AND CREDIT RISK. THE CREDIT RISK AND AVERAGE MATURITY OF OUR FIXED-INCOME PORTFOLIO ARE MANAGED TO\nACHIEVE ECONOMIC RETURNS THAT CORRELATE TO CERTAIN FIXED-INCOME INDICES. THE SETTLEMENT RISK RELATED TO THESE INVESTMENTS IS INSIGNIFICANT GIVEN THAT THE SHORT-TERM INVESTMENTS HELD ARE PRIMARILY HIGHLY LIQUID INVESTMENT-GRADE FIXED-INCOME\nSECURITIES. WHILE WE OWN CERTAIN MORTGAGE-BACKED AND ASSET-BACKED FIXED-INCOME SECURITIES, OUR PORTFOLIO AS OF JUNE 30, 2011 DOES NOT CONTAIN DIRECT EXPOSURE TO SUBPRIME MORTGAGES OR STRUCTURED VEHICLES THAT DERIVE THEIR VALUE FROM SUBPRIME\nCOLLATERAL. THE MAJORITY OF OUR MORTGAGE-BACKED SECURITIES ARE COLLATERALIZED BY PRIME RESIDENTIAL MORTGAGES AND CARRY A 100% PRINCIPAL AND INTEREST GUARANTEE, PRIMARILY FROM FEDERAL NATIONAL MORTGAGE ASSOCIATION, FEDERAL HOME LOAN MORTGAGE\nCORPORATION, AND GOVERNMENT NATIONAL MORTGAGE ASSOCIATION.\n34\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nPART II\nITEM 7\nOF THE CASH, CASH EQUIVALENTS, AND SHORT-TERM INVESTMENTS AT JUNE 30, 2011, APPROXIMATELY $45\nBILLION WAS HELD BY OUR FOREIGN SUBSIDIARIES AND WERE SUBJECT TO MATERIAL REPATRIATION TAX EFFECTS. THE AMOUNT OF CASH AND INVESTMENTS HELD BY FOREIGN SUBSIDIARIES SUBJECT TO OTHER RESTRICTIONS ON THE FREE FLOW OF FUNDS (PRIMARILY CURRENCY AND OTHER\nLOCAL REGULATORY) WAS APPROXIMATELY $379 MILLION. AS OF JUNE 30, 2011, APPROXIMATELY 68% OF THE SHORT-TERM INVESTMENTS HELD BY OUR FOREIGN SUBSIDIARIES WERE INVESTED IN U.S. GOVERNMENT AND AGENCY SECURITIES, APPROXIMATELY 12% WERE INVESTED IN\nCORPORATE NOTES AND BONDS OF U.S. COMPANIES, AND 5% WERE INVESTED IN U.S. MORTGAGE-BACKED SECURITIES, ALL OF WHICH ARE DENOMINATED IN U.S. DOLLARS.\nSECURITIES LENDING\nWE LEND CERTAIN\nFIXED-INCOME AND EQUITY SECURITIES TO INCREASE INVESTMENT RETURNS. THE LOANED SECURITIES CONTINUE TO BE CARRIED AS INVESTMENTS ON OUR BALANCE SHEET. CASH AND\/OR SECURITY INTERESTS ARE RECEIVED AS COLLATERAL FOR THE LOANED SECURITIES WITH THE AMOUNT\nDETERMINED BASED UPON THE UNDERLYING SECURITY LENT AND THE CREDITWORTHINESS OF THE BORROWER. CASH RECEIVED IS RECORDED AS AN ASSET WITH A CORRESPONDING LIABILITY. OUR SECURITIES LENDING PAYABLE BALANCE WAS $1.2 BILLION AS OF JUNE 30, 2011. OUR\nAVERAGE AND MAXIMUM SECURITIES LENDING PAYABLE BALANCES FOR THE FISCAL YEAR WERE $1.6 BILLION AND $3.3 BILLION, RESPECTIVELY. INTRA-YEAR VARIANCES IN THE AMOUNT OF SECURITIES LOANED ARE MAINLY DUE TO FLUCTUATIONS IN THE DEMAND FOR THE SECURITIES.\nVALUATION\nIN GENERAL, AND\nWHERE APPLICABLE, WE USE QUOTED PRICES IN ACTIVE MARKETS FOR IDENTICAL ASSETS OR LIABILITIES TO DETERMINE THE FAIR VALUE OF OUR FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS. THIS PRICING METHODOLOGY APPLIES TO OUR LEVEL 1 INVESTMENTS, SUCH AS EXCHANGE-TRADED MUTUAL\nFUNDS, DOMESTIC AND INTERNATIONAL EQUITIES, AND U.S. TREASURIES. IF QUOTED PRICES IN ACTIVE MARKETS FOR IDENTICAL ASSETS OR LIABILITIES ARE NOT AVAILABLE TO DETERMINE FAIR VALUE, THEN WE USE QUOTED PRICES FOR SIMILAR ASSETS AND LIABILITIES OR\nINPUTS OTHER THAN THE QUOTED PRICES THAT ARE OBSERVABLE EITHER DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY. THIS PRICING METHODOLOGY APPLIES TO OUR LEVEL 2 INVESTMENTS SUCH AS CORPORATE NOTES AND BONDS, FOREIGN GOVERNMENT BONDS, MORTGAGE-BACKED SECURITIES, AND AGENCY\nSECURITIES. LEVEL 3 INVESTMENTS ARE VALUED USING INTERNALLY DEVELOPED MODELS WITH UNOBSERVABLE INPUTS. ASSETS AND LIABILITIES MEASURED USING UNOBSERVABLE INPUTS ARE AN IMMATERIAL PORTION OF OUR PORTFOLIO.\nA MAJORITY OF OUR INVESTMENTS ARE PRICED BY PRICING VENDORS AND ARE GENERALLY LEVEL 1 OR LEVEL 2 INVESTMENTS AS THESE VENDORS EITHER PROVIDE A\nQUOTED MARKET PRICE IN AN ACTIVE MARKET OR USE OBSERVABLE INPUTS FOR THEIR PRICING WITHOUT APPLYING SIGNIFICANT ADJUSTMENTS. BROKER PRICING IS USED MAINLY WHEN A QUOTED PRICE IS NOT AVAILABLE, THE INVESTMENT IS NOT PRICED BY OUR PRICING\nVENDORS, OR WHEN A BROKER PRICE IS MORE REFLECTIVE OF FAIR VALUES IN THE MARKET IN WHICH THE INVESTMENT TRADES. OUR BROKER-PRICED INVESTMENTS ARE GENERALLY LABELED AS LEVEL 2 INVESTMENTS BECAUSE THE BROKER PRICES THESE INVESTMENTS BASED ON SIMILAR\nASSETS WITHOUT APPLYING SIGNIFICANT ADJUSTMENTS. IN ADDITION, ALL OF OUR BROKER-PRICED INVESTMENTS HAVE A SUFFICIENT LEVEL OF TRADING VOLUME TO DEMONSTRATE THAT THE FAIR VALUES USED ARE APPROPRIATE FOR THESE INVESTMENTS. OUR FAIR VALUE\nPROCESSES INCLUDE CONTROLS THAT ARE DESIGNED TO ENSURE APPROPRIATE FAIR VALUES ARE RECORDED.

UNDER THE\nCAPPED CALL TRANSACTIONS, WE PURCHASED FROM THE OPTION COUNTERPARTIES CAPPED CALL OPTIONS THAT IN THE AGGREGATE RELATE TO THE TOTAL NUMBER OF SHARES OF OUR COMMON STOCK UNDERLYING THE NOTES, WITH A STRIKE PRICE EQUAL TO THE CONVERSION PRICE OF THE\nNOTES AND WITH A CAP PRICE EQUAL TO $37.16. THE PURCHASED CAPPED CALLS WERE VALUED AT $40 MILLION AND RECORDED TO STOCKHOLDERS\u0092 EQUITY.\nUNEARNED REVENUE\nUNEARNED REVENUE AT\nJUNE 30, 2011 COMPRISED MAINLY UNEARNED REVENUE FROM VOLUME LICENSING PROGRAMS.

ON SEPTEMBER 22, 2008, WE ALSO ANNOUNCED THAT OUR BOARD OF DIRECTORS APPROVED A NEW SHARE REPURCHASE PROGRAM AUTHORIZING UP TO $40.0 BILLION IN SHARE REPURCHASES WITH AN EXPIRATION DATE OF\nSEPTEMBER 30, 2013 (THE \u00932008 PROGRAM\u0094). AS OF JUNE 30, 2011, APPROXIMATELY $12.2 BILLION REMAINED OF THE $40.0 BILLION APPROVED REPURCHASE AMOUNT.

WE HAVE ALSO EXCLUDED UNEARNED\nREVENUE OF $1.4 BILLION AND NON-CASH ITEMS OF $279 MILLION.\nOTHER PLANNED USES OF CAPITAL\nWE WILL CONTINUE TO INVEST IN SALES, MARKETING, PRODUCT SUPPORT INFRASTRUCTURE, AND EXISTING AND ADVANCED AREAS OF TECHNOLOGY. ADDITIONS TO\nPROPERTY AND EQUIPMENT WILL CONTINUE, INCLUDING NEW FACILITIES, DATA CENTERS, AND COMPUTER SYSTEMS FOR RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT, SALES AND MARKETING, SUPPORT, AND ADMINISTRATIVE STAFF. WE HAVE OPERATING LEASES FOR MOST U.S. AND INTERNATIONAL SALES\nAND SUPPORT OFFICES AND CERTAIN EQUIPMENT. WE HAVE NOT ENGAGED IN ANY RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS OR ARRANGEMENTS WITH UNCONSOLIDATED ENTITIES OR OTHER PERSONS THAT ARE REASONABLY LIKELY TO MATERIALLY AFFECT LIQUIDITY OR THE AVAILABILITY OF CAPITAL\nRESOURCES.\nDEFINITIVE AGREEMENT WITH SKYPE\nON MAY 10, 2011, WE ANNOUNCED THAT WE HAD ENTERED INTO A DEFINITIVE AGREEMENT WITH SKYPE GLOBAL S.A\u0300.R.L. (\u0093SKYPE\u0094) UNDER WHICH WE WOULD ACQUIRE SKYPE, A LEADING INTERNET COMMUNICATIONS\nCOMPANY, FOR $8.5 BILLION IN CASH. WE ANTICIPATE THE ACQUISITION WILL EXTEND SKYPE\u0092S BRAND AND REACH OF ITS NETWORK PLATFORM, WHILE ENHANCING OUR EXISTING PORTFOLIO OF REAL-TIME COMMUNICATIONS PRODUCTS AND SERVICES. THE ACQUISITION IS SUBJECT\nTO REGULATORY APPROVALS AND OTHER CUSTOMARY CLOSING CONDITIONS. WE OBTAINED REGULATORY APPROVAL IN THE U.S. AND EXPECT TO OBTAIN ALL REMAINING REQUIRED REGULATORY APPROVALS DURING CALENDAR YEAR 2011.\nLIQUIDITY\nWE EARN A SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT OF\nOUR OPERATING INCOME OUTSIDE THE U.S., WHICH IS DEEMED TO BE PERMANENTLY REINVESTED IN FOREIGN JURISDICTIONS. AS A RESULT, AS DISCUSSED ABOVE UNDER CASH, CASH EQUIVALENTS, AND INVESTMENTS, THE MAJORITY OF OUR CASH, CASH EQUIVALENTS, AND SHORT-TERM\nINVESTMENTS ARE HELD BY FOREIGN SUBSIDIARIES. WE CURRENTLY DO NOT INTEND NOR FORESEE A NEED TO REPATRIATE THESE FUNDS. WE EXPECT EXISTING DOMESTIC CASH, CASH EQUIVALENTS,\n39\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nPART II\nITEM 7\nSHORT-TERM INVESTMENTS, AND CASH FLOWS FROM OPERATIONS TO CONTINUE TO BE SUFFICIENT TO FUND OUR DOMESTIC OPERATING ACTIVITIES AND CASH COMMITMENTS FOR INVESTING AND FINANCING ACTIVITIES, SUCH AS\nREGULAR QUARTERLY DIVIDENDS, DEBT REPAYMENT SCHEDULES, AND MATERIAL CAPITAL EXPENDITURES, FOR AT LEAST THE NEXT 12 MONTHS AND THEREAFTER FOR THE FORESEEABLE FUTURE. IN ADDITION, WE EXPECT EXISTING FOREIGN CASH, CASH EQUIVALENTS, SHORT-TERM\nINVESTMENTS, AND CASH FLOWS FROM OPERATIONS TO CONTINUE TO BE SUFFICIENT TO FUND OUR FOREIGN OPERATING ACTIVITIES AND CASH COMMITMENTS FOR INVESTING ACTIVITIES, SUCH AS MATERIAL CAPITAL EXPENDITURES, FOR AT LEAST THE NEXT 12 MONTHS AND THEREAFTER\nFOR THE FORESEEABLE FUTURE.\nSHOULD WE REQUIRE MORE CAPITAL IN THE U.S. THAN IS GENERATED BY OUR OPERATIONS DOMESTICALLY, FOR EXAMPLE TO\nFUND SIGNIFICANT DISCRETIONARY ACTIVITIES, SUCH AS ACQUISITIONS OF BUSINESSES AND SHARE REPURCHASES, WE COULD ELECT TO REPATRIATE FUTURE EARNINGS FROM FOREIGN JURISDICTIONS OR RAISE CAPITAL IN THE U.S. THROUGH DEBT OR EQUITY ISSUANCES. THESE\nALTERNATIVES COULD RESULT IN HIGHER EFFECTIVE TAX RATES, INCREASED INTEREST EXPENSE, OR OTHER DILUTION OF OUR EARNINGS. WE HAVE BORROWED FUNDS DOMESTICALLY AND CONTINUE TO HAVE THE ABILITY TO BORROW FUNDS DOMESTICALLY AT REASONABLE INTEREST RATES.\nAS A RESULT OF THE SPECIAL DIVIDEND PAID IN THE SECOND QUARTER OF FISCAL YEAR 2005 AND SHARES REPURCHASED, OUR RETAINED DEFICIT,\nINCLUDING ACCUMULATED OTHER COMPREHENSIVE INCOME, WAS $6.3 BILLION AT JUNE 30, 2011. OUR RETAINED DEFICIT IS NOT EXPECTED TO AFFECT OUR FUTURE ABILITY TO OPERATE, PAY DIVIDENDS, OR REPAY OUR DEBT GIVEN OUR CONTINUING PROFITABILITY AND STRONG\nFINANCIAL POSITION.\nRECENTLY ISSUED ACCOUNTING STANDARDS\nRECENTLY ADOPTED ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS\nON JULY 1, 2010, WE ADOPTED GUIDANCE ISSUED\nBY THE FINANCIAL ACCOUNTING STANDARDS BOARD (\u0093FASB\u0094) ON REVENUE RECOGNITION. UNDER THE NEW GUIDANCE ON ARRANGEMENTS THAT INCLUDE SOFTWARE ELEMENTS, TANGIBLE PRODUCTS THAT HAVE SOFTWARE COMPONENTS THAT ARE ESSENTIAL TO THE FUNCTIONALITY OF\nTHE TANGIBLE PRODUCT ARE NO LONGER WITHIN THE SCOPE OF THE SOFTWARE REVENUE RECOGNITION GUIDANCE, AND SOFTWARE-ENABLED PRODUCTS ARE NOW SUBJECT TO OTHER RELEVANT REVENUE RECOGNITION GUIDANCE. ADDITIONALLY, THE FASB ISSUED GUIDANCE ON REVENUE\nARRANGEMENTS WITH MULTIPLE DELIVERABLES THAT ARE OUTSIDE THE SCOPE OF THE SOFTWARE REVENUE RECOGNITION GUIDANCE. UNDER THE NEW GUIDANCE, WHEN VENDOR SPECIFIC OBJECTIVE EVIDENCE OR THIRD PARTY EVIDENCE FOR DELIVERABLES IN AN ARRANGEMENT CANNOT BE\nDETERMINED, A BEST ESTIMATE OF THE SELLING PRICE IS REQUIRED TO SEPARATE DELIVERABLES AND ALLOCATE ARRANGEMENT CONSIDERATION USING THE RELATIVE SELLING PRICE METHOD. THE NEW GUIDANCE INCLUDES NEW DISCLOSURE REQUIREMENTS ON HOW THE APPLICATION OF THE\nRELATIVE SELLING PRICE METHOD AFFECTS THE TIMING AND AMOUNT OF REVENUE RECOGNITION. ADOPTION OF THE NEW GUIDANCE DID NOT HAVE A MATERIAL IMPACT ON OUR FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.\nON JULY 1, 2010, WE ADOPTED NEW GUIDANCE ISSUED BY THE FASB ON THE CONSOLIDATION OF VARIABLE INTEREST ENTITIES. THE NEW GUIDANCE REQUIRES REVISED EVALUATIONS OF WHETHER ENTITIES REPRESENT VARIABLE INTEREST\nENTITIES, ONGOING ASSESSMENTS OF CONTROL OVER SUCH ENTITIES, AND ADDITIONAL DISCLOSURES FOR VARIABLE INTERESTS. ADOPTION OF THE NEW GUIDANCE DID NOT HAVE A MATERIAL IMPACT ON OUR FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.\nRECENT ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS NOT YET ADOPTED\nIN JUNE 2011, THE FASB ISSUED GUIDANCE ON PRESENTATION OF COMPREHENSIVE INCOME. THE NEW GUIDANCE ELIMINATES THE CURRENT OPTION TO REPORT OTHER COMPREHENSIVE INCOME AND ITS COMPONENTS IN THE STATEMENT OF\nCHANGES IN EQUITY. INSTEAD, AN ENTITY WILL BE REQUIRED TO PRESENT EITHER A CONTINUOUS STATEMENT OF NET INCOME AND OTHER COMPREHENSIVE INCOME OR IN TWO SEPARATE BUT CONSECUTIVE STATEMENTS. THE NEW GUIDANCE WILL BE EFFECTIVE FOR US BEGINNING\nJULY 1, 2012 AND WILL HAVE PRESENTATION CHANGES ONLY.\nIN MAY 2011, THE FASB ISSUED GUIDANCE TO AMEND THE ACCOUNTING AND DISCLOSURE\nREQUIREMENTS ON FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS. THE NEW GUIDANCE LIMITS THE HIGHEST-AND-BEST-USE MEASURE TO NONFINANCIAL ASSETS, PERMITS CERTAIN FINANCIAL ASSETS AND LIABILITIES WITH OFFSETTING POSITIONS IN MARKET OR COUNTERPARTY CREDIT RISKS TO BE\nMEASURED AT A NET BASIS, AND PROVIDES GUIDANCE ON THE APPLICABILITY OF PREMIUMS AND DISCOUNTS. ADDITIONALLY, THE NEW GUIDANCE\n40\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nPART II\nITEM 7\nEXPANDS THE DISCLOSURES ON LEVEL 3 INPUTS BY REQUIRING QUANTITATIVE DISCLOSURE OF THE UNOBSERVABLE INPUTS AND ASSUMPTIONS, AS WELL AS DESCRIPTION OF THE VALUATION PROCESSES AND THE SENSITIVITY OF\nTHE FAIR VALUE TO CHANGES IN UNOBSERVABLE INPUTS. THE NEW GUIDANCE WILL BE EFFECTIVE FOR US BEGINNING JANUARY 1, 2012. OTHER THAN REQUIRING ADDITIONAL DISCLOSURES, WE DO NOT ANTICIPATE MATERIAL IMPACTS ON OUR FINANCIAL STATEMENTS UPON\nADOPTION.\nIN JANUARY 2010, THE FASB ISSUED GUIDANCE TO AMEND THE DISCLOSURE REQUIREMENTS RELATED TO FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS. THE\nGUIDANCE REQUIRES THE DISCLOSURE OF ROLL FORWARD ACTIVITIES ON PURCHASES, SALES, ISSUANCE, AND SETTLEMENTS OF THE ASSETS AND LIABILITIES MEASURED USING SIGNIFICANT UNOBSERVABLE INPUTS (LEVEL 3 FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS). THE GUIDANCE WILL BECOME\nEFFECTIVE FOR US WITH THE REPORTING PERIOD BEGINNING JULY 1, 2011. OTHER THAN REQUIRING ADDITIONAL DISCLOSURES, THE ADOPTION OF THIS NEW GUIDANCE WILL NOT HAVE A MATERIAL IMPACT ON OUR FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.\nAPPLICATION OF CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES\nOUR FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND ACCOMPANYING NOTES ARE PREPARED IN ACCORDANCE WITH ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES GENERALLY ACCEPTED IN THE UNITED STATES (\u0093U.S. GAAP\u0094). PREPARING FINANCIAL STATEMENTS REQUIRES\nMANAGEMENT TO MAKE ESTIMATES AND ASSUMPTIONS THAT AFFECT THE REPORTED AMOUNTS OF ASSETS, LIABILITIES, REVENUE, AND EXPENSES. THESE ESTIMATES AND ASSUMPTIONS ARE AFFECTED BY MANAGEMENT\u0092S APPLICATION OF ACCOUNTING POLICIES. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING\nPOLICIES FOR US INCLUDE REVENUE RECOGNITION, IMPAIRMENT OF INVESTMENT SECURITIES, GOODWILL, RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT COSTS, CONTINGENCIES, INCOME TAXES, AND STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION.\nREVENUE RECOGNITION\nSOFTWARE REVENUE RECOGNITION REQUIRES JUDGMENT, INCLUDING WHETHER A\nSOFTWARE ARRANGEMENT INCLUDES MULTIPLE ELEMENTS, AND IF SO, WHETHER VENDOR-SPECIFIC OBJECTIVE EVIDENCE (\u0093VSOE\u0094) OF FAIR VALUE EXISTS FOR THOSE ELEMENTS. A PORTION OF REVENUE MAY BE RECORDED AS UNEARNED DUE TO UNDELIVERED ELEMENTS. CHANGES\nTO THE ELEMENTS IN A SOFTWARE ARRANGEMENT, THE ABILITY TO IDENTIFY VSOE FOR THOSE ELEMENTS, AND THE FAIR VALUE OF THE RESPECTIVE ELEMENTS COULD MATERIALLY IMPACT THE AMOUNT OF EARNED AND UNEARNED REVENUE. JUDGMENT IS ALSO REQUIRED TO ASSESS WHETHER\nFUTURE RELEASES OF CERTAIN SOFTWARE REPRESENT NEW PRODUCTS OR UPGRADES AND ENHANCEMENTS TO EXISTING PRODUCTS.\nIMPAIRMENT OF INVESTMENT SECURITIES\nINVESTMENTS ARE REVIEWED QUARTERLY FOR INDICATORS OF OTHER-THAN-TEMPORARY IMPAIRMENT. THIS DETERMINATION REQUIRES SIGNIFICANT\nJUDGMENT. IN MAKING THIS JUDGMENT, WE EMPLOY A SYSTEMATIC METHODOLOGY QUARTERLY THAT CONSIDERS AVAILABLE QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE EVIDENCE IN EVALUATING POTENTIAL IMPAIRMENT OF OUR INVESTMENTS. IF THE COST OF AN INVESTMENT EXCEEDS ITS FAIR\nVALUE, WE EVALUATE, AMONG OTHER FACTORS, GENERAL MARKET CONDITIONS, CREDIT QUALITY OF DEBT INSTRUMENT ISSUERS, THE DURATION AND EXTENT TO WHICH THE FAIR VALUE IS LESS THAN COST, AND FOR EQUITY SECURITIES, OUR INTENT AND ABILITY TO HOLD, OR PLANS TO\nSELL, THE INVESTMENT. FOR FIXED-INCOME SECURITIES, WE ALSO EVALUATE WHETHER WE HAVE PLANS TO SELL THE SECURITY OR IT IS MORE LIKELY THAN NOT THAT WE WILL BE REQUIRED TO SELL THE SECURITY BEFORE RECOVERY. WE ALSO CONSIDER SPECIFIC ADVERSE CONDITIONS\nRELATED TO THE FINANCIAL HEALTH OF AND BUSINESS OUTLOOK FOR THE INVESTEE, INCLUDING INDUSTRY AND SECTOR PERFORMANCE, CHANGES IN TECHNOLOGY, AND OPERATIONAL AND FINANCING CASH FLOW FACTORS. ONCE A DECLINE IN FAIR VALUE IS DETERMINED TO BE\nOTHER-THAN-TEMPORARY, AN IMPAIRMENT CHARGE IS RECORDED TO OTHER INCOME (EXPENSE) AND A NEW COST BASIS IN THE INVESTMENT IS ESTABLISHED. IF MARKET, INDUSTRY, AND\/OR INVESTEE CONDITIONS DETERIORATE, WE MAY INCUR FUTURE IMPAIRMENTS.\nGOODWILL\nWE ALLOCATE GOODWILL TO REPORTING\nUNITS BASED ON THE REPORTING UNIT EXPECTED TO BENEFIT FROM THE BUSINESS COMBINATION. WE EVALUATE OUR REPORTING UNITS ON AN ANNUAL BASIS AND, IF NECESSARY, REASSIGN GOODWILL USING A RELATIVE FAIR VALUE ALLOCATION APPROACH. GOODWILL IS TESTED FOR\nIMPAIRMENT AT THE REPORTING UNIT LEVEL (OPERATING SEGMENT OR ONE LEVEL BELOW AN OPERATING SEGMENT) ON AN ANNUAL BASIS (MAY 1 FOR US) AND BETWEEN ANNUAL TESTS IF AN EVENT OCCURS OR CIRCUMSTANCES CHANGE THAT WOULD MORE LIKELY THAN NOT REDUCE THE FAIR\nVALUE OF A REPORTING UNIT BELOW ITS CARRYING VALUE. THESE EVENTS OR CIRCUMSTANCES COULD INCLUDE A SIGNIFICANT CHANGE IN THE BUSINESS CLIMATE, LEGAL FACTORS, OPERATING PERFORMANCE INDICATORS, COMPETITION, OR SALE OR DISPOSITION OF A SIGNIFICANT\nPORTION OF A REPORTING UNIT.\n41\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nPART II\nITEM 7\nAPPLICATION OF THE GOODWILL IMPAIRMENT TEST REQUIRES JUDGMENT, INCLUDING THE IDENTIFICATION OF\nREPORTING UNITS, ASSIGNMENT OF ASSETS AND LIABILITIES TO REPORTING UNITS, ASSIGNMENT OF GOODWILL TO REPORTING UNITS, AND DETERMINATION OF THE FAIR VALUE OF EACH REPORTING UNIT. THE FAIR VALUE OF EACH REPORTING UNIT IS ESTIMATED USING A DISCOUNTED\nCASH FLOW METHODOLOGY. THIS ANALYSIS REQUIRES SIGNIFICANT JUDGMENTS, INCLUDING ESTIMATION OF FUTURE CASH FLOWS, WHICH IS DEPENDENT ON INTERNAL FORECASTS, ESTIMATION OF THE LONG-TERM RATE OF GROWTH FOR OUR BUSINESS, ESTIMATION OF THE USEFUL LIFE OVER\nWHICH CASH FLOWS WILL OCCUR, AND DETERMINATION OF OUR WEIGHTED AVERAGE COST OF CAPITAL. AMONG OUR REPORTING UNITS, THE FAIR VALUE OF OSD HAS BEEN THE CLOSEST TO ITS CARRYING VALUE. THE CARRYING VALUE OF OSD\u0092S GOODWILL WAS $6.4 BILLION AS OF\nJUNE 30, 2011.\nTHE ESTIMATES USED TO CALCULATE THE FAIR VALUE OF A REPORTING UNIT CHANGE FROM YEAR TO YEAR BASED ON OPERATING\nRESULTS AND MARKET CONDITIONS. CHANGES IN THESE ESTIMATES AND ASSUMPTIONS COULD MATERIALLY AFFECT THE DETERMINATION OF FAIR VALUE AND GOODWILL IMPAIRMENT FOR EACH REPORTING UNIT.\nRESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT COSTS\nCOSTS INCURRED INTERNALLY IN RESEARCHING AND DEVELOPING A\nCOMPUTER SOFTWARE PRODUCT ARE CHARGED TO EXPENSE UNTIL TECHNOLOGICAL FEASIBILITY HAS BEEN ESTABLISHED FOR THE PRODUCT. ONCE TECHNOLOGICAL FEASIBILITY IS ESTABLISHED, ALL SOFTWARE COSTS ARE CAPITALIZED UNTIL THE PRODUCT IS AVAILABLE FOR GENERAL\nRELEASE TO CUSTOMERS. JUDGMENT IS REQUIRED IN DETERMINING WHEN TECHNOLOGICAL FEASIBILITY OF A PRODUCT IS ESTABLISHED. WE HAVE DETERMINED THAT TECHNOLOGICAL FEASIBILITY FOR OUR SOFTWARE PRODUCTS IS REACHED AFTER ALL HIGH-RISK DEVELOPMENT ISSUES HAVE\nBEEN RESOLVED THROUGH CODING AND TESTING. GENERALLY, THIS OCCURS SHORTLY BEFORE THE PRODUCTS ARE RELEASED TO MANUFACTURING. THE AMORTIZATION OF THESE COSTS IS INCLUDED IN COST OF REVENUE OVER THE ESTIMATED LIFE OF THE PRODUCTS.\nLEGAL AND OTHER CONTINGENCIES\nTHE OUTCOMES\nOF LEGAL PROCEEDINGS AND CLAIMS BROUGHT AGAINST US ARE SUBJECT TO SIGNIFICANT UNCERTAINTY. AN ESTIMATED LOSS FROM A LOSS CONTINGENCY SUCH AS A LEGAL PROCEEDING OR CLAIM IS ACCRUED BY A CHARGE TO INCOME IF IT IS PROBABLE THAT AN ASSET HAS BEEN\nIMPAIRED OR A LIABILITY HAS BEEN INCURRED AND THE AMOUNT OF THE LOSS CAN BE REASONABLY ESTIMATED. DISCLOSURE OF A CONTINGENCY IS REQUIRED IF THERE IS AT LEAST A REASONABLE POSSIBILITY THAT A LOSS HAS BEEN INCURRED. IN DETERMINING WHETHER A LOSS\nSHOULD BE ACCRUED WE EVALUATE, AMONG OTHER FACTORS, THE DEGREE OF PROBABILITY OF AN UNFAVORABLE OUTCOME AND THE ABILITY TO MAKE A REASONABLE ESTIMATE OF THE AMOUNT OF LOSS. CHANGES IN THESE FACTORS COULD MATERIALLY IMPACT OUR FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.\nINCOME TAXES\nTHE OBJECTIVES OF\nACCOUNTING FOR INCOME TAXES ARE TO RECOGNIZE THE AMOUNT OF TAXES PAYABLE OR REFUNDABLE FOR THE CURRENT YEAR AND DEFERRED TAX LIABILITIES AND ASSETS FOR THE FUTURE TAX CONSEQUENCES OF EVENTS THAT HAVE BEEN RECOGNIZED IN AN ENTITY\u0092S FINANCIAL\nSTATEMENTS OR TAX RETURNS. WE RECOGNIZE THE TAX BENEFIT FROM AN UNCERTAIN TAX POSITION ONLY IF IT IS MORE LIKELY THAN NOT THAT THE TAX POSITION WILL BE SUSTAINED ON EXAMINATION BY THE TAXING AUTHORITIES, BASED ON THE TECHNICAL MERITS OF THE\nPOSITION. THE TAX BENEFITS RECOGNIZED IN THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FROM SUCH A POSITION SHOULD BE MEASURED BASED ON THE LARGEST BENEFIT THAT HAS A GREATER THAN 50% LIKELIHOOD OF BEING REALIZED UPON ULTIMATE SETTLEMENT. ACCOUNTING LITERATURE ALSO\nPROVIDES GUIDANCE ON DERECOGNITION OF INCOME TAX ASSETS AND LIABILITIES, CLASSIFICATION OF CURRENT AND DEFERRED INCOME TAX ASSETS AND LIABILITIES, ACCOUNTING FOR INTEREST AND PENALTIES ASSOCIATED WITH TAX POSITIONS, AND INCOME TAX DISCLOSURES.\nJUDGMENT IS REQUIRED IN ASSESSING THE FUTURE TAX CONSEQUENCES OF EVENTS THAT HAVE BEEN RECOGNIZED IN OUR FINANCIAL STATEMENTS OR TAX RETURNS. VARIATIONS IN THE ACTUAL OUTCOME OF THESE FUTURE TAX CONSEQUENCES COULD MATERIALLY IMPACT OUR FINANCIAL\nSTATEMENTS.\nSTOCK-BASED COMPENSATION\nSTOCK-BASED COMPENSATION COST IS MEASURED AT THE GRANT DATE BASED ON THE FAIR VALUE OF THE AWARD AND IS RECOGNIZED AS EXPENSE OVER THE REQUISITE SERVICE PERIOD. DETERMINING THE FAIR VALUE OF STOCK-BASED AWARDS AT\nTHE GRANT DATE REQUIRES JUDGMENT, INCLUDING ESTIMATING EXPECTED DIVIDENDS. IN ADDITION, JUDGMENT IS ALSO REQUIRED IN ESTIMATING THE AMOUNT OF STOCK-BASED AWARDS THAT ARE EXPECTED TO BE FORFEITED. IF ACTUAL RESULTS DIFFER SIGNIFICANTLY FROM THESE\nESTIMATES, STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION EXPENSE AND OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS COULD BE IMPACTED.\n42\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nPART II\nITEM 7\nSTATEMENT OF MANAGEMENT\u0092S RESPONSIBILITY FOR FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nMANAGEMENT IS RESPONSIBLE FOR THE PREPARATION OF THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND RELATED INFORMATION THAT ARE PRESENTED IN THIS REPORT.\nTHE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS, WHICH INCLUDE AMOUNTS BASED ON MANAGEMENT\u0092S ESTIMATES AND JUDGMENTS, HAVE BEEN PREPARED IN CONFORMITY WITH ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES GENERALLY ACCEPTED IN THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA.\nTHE COMPANY DESIGNS AND MAINTAINS ACCOUNTING AND INTERNAL CONTROL SYSTEMS TO PROVIDE REASONABLE ASSURANCE AT REASONABLE COST THAT ASSETS ARE\nSAFEGUARDED AGAINST LOSS FROM UNAUTHORIZED USE OR DISPOSITION, AND THAT THE FINANCIAL RECORDS ARE RELIABLE FOR PREPARING FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND MAINTAINING ACCOUNTABILITY FOR ASSETS.

AS PART OF ITS STRATEGY, THE COMPANY CONTINUES TO EXPAND ITS PLATFORM FOR THE DISCOVERY AND DELIVERY OF THIRD-PARTY DIGITAL CONTENT AND APPLICATIONS THROUGH THE ITUNES STORE. AS PART\nOF THE ITUNES STORE, THE COMPANY\u0092S APP STORE AND IBOOKSTORE ALLOW CUSTOMERS TO DISCOVER AND DOWNLOAD APPLICATIONS AND BOOKS THROUGH EITHER A MAC OR WINDOWS-BASED COMPUTER OR THROUGH \u0093IOS DEVICES,\u0094 NAMELY IPHONE, IPAD AND IPOD TOUCH.\nIN JANUARY 2011, THE COMPANY OPENED THE MAC APP STORE TO ALLOW CUSTOMERS TO EASILY DISCOVER, DOWNLOAD AND INSTALL APPLICATIONS FOR THEIR MACS. THE COMPANY ALSO SUPPORTS A COMMUNITY FOR THE DEVELOPMENT OF THIRD-PARTY SOFTWARE AND HARDWARE PRODUCTS\nAND DIGITAL CONTENT THAT COMPLEMENT THE COMPANY\u0092S OFFERINGS.

WHILE THE COMPANY IS\nWIDELY RECOGNIZED AS A LEADING INNOVATOR IN THE MARKETS WHERE IT COMPETES, THESE MARKETS ARE HIGHLY COMPETITIVE AND SUBJECT TO AGGRESSIVE PRICING. TO REMAIN COMPETITIVE, THE COMPANY BELIEVES THAT CONTINUAL INVESTMENT IN RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT AND\nMARKETING AND ADVERTISING IS CRITICAL TO THE DEVELOPMENT AND SALE OF INNOVATIVE PRODUCTS AND TECHNOLOGIES. THE COMPANY\u0092S RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT SPENDING IS FOCUSED ON INVESTING IN NEW HARDWARE AND SOFTWARE PRODUCTS, AND IN FURTHER DEVELOPING\nITS EXISTING PRODUCTS, INCLUDING IPHONE, IPAD, MAC, AND IPOD HARDWARE; IOS AND MAC OS X OPERATING SYSTEMS; AND A VARIETY OF APPLICATION SOFTWARE AND ONLINE SERVICES.\n25\nTHE COMPANY USES A VARIETY OF DIRECT AND INDIRECT DISTRIBUTION CHANNELS, SUCH AS ITS RETAIL\nSTORES, ONLINE STORES, AND DIRECT SALES FORCE, AND THIRD-PARTY CELLULAR NETWORK CARRIERS, WHOLESALERS, RETAILERS, AND VALUE-ADDED RESELLERS. THE COMPANY BELIEVES THAT SALES OF ITS INNOVATIVE AND DIFFERENTIATED PRODUCTS ARE ENHANCED BY KNOWLEDGEABLE\nSALESPERSONS WHO CAN CONVEY THE VALUE OF THE HARDWARE AND SOFTWARE INTEGRATION, AND DEMONSTRATE THE UNIQUE SOLUTIONS THAT ARE AVAILABLE ON ITS PRODUCTS. THE COMPANY FURTHER BELIEVES PROVIDING DIRECT CONTACT WITH ITS TARGETED CUSTOMERS IS AN\nEFFECTIVE WAY TO DEMONSTRATE THE ADVANTAGES OF ITS PRODUCTS OVER THOSE OF ITS COMPETITORS AND PROVIDING A HIGH-QUALITY SALES AND AFTER-SALES SUPPORT EXPERIENCE IS CRITICAL TO ATTRACTING NEW AND RETAINING EXISTING CUSTOMERS. TO ENSURE A HIGH-QUALITY\nBUYING EXPERIENCE FOR ITS PRODUCTS IN WHICH SERVICE AND EDUCATION ARE EMPHASIZED, THE COMPANY CONTINUES TO EXPAND AND IMPROVE ITS DISTRIBUTION CAPABILITIES BY EXPANDING THE NUMBER OF ITS OWN RETAIL STORES WORLDWIDE. ADDITIONALLY, THE COMPANY HAS\nINVESTED IN PROGRAMS TO ENHANCE RESELLER SALES BY PLACING HIGH QUALITY APPLE FIXTURES, MERCHANDISING MATERIALS AND OTHER RESOURCES WITHIN SELECTED THIRD-PARTY RESELLER LOCATIONS. THROUGH THE APPLE PREMIUM RESELLER PROGRAM, CERTAIN THIRD-PARTY\nRESELLERS FOCUS ON THE APPLE PLATFORM BY PROVIDING A HIGH LEVEL OF INTEGRATION AND SUPPORT SERVICES, AND PRODUCT EXPERTISE.\nJAPAN\nEARTHQUAKE AND TSUNAMI AND THAILAND FLOODING\nON MARCH 11, 2011, THE NORTHEAST COAST OF JAPAN EXPERIENCED A SEVERE\nEARTHQUAKE FOLLOWED BY A TSUNAMI, WITH CONTINUING AFTERSHOCKS. THESE GEOLOGICAL EVENTS HAVE CAUSED SIGNIFICANT DAMAGE IN THE REGION, INCLUDING SEVERE DAMAGE TO NUCLEAR POWER PLANTS, AND HAVE IMPACTED JAPAN\u0092S POWER AND OTHER INFRASTRUCTURE AS\nWELL AS ITS ECONOMY. CERTAIN OF THE COMPANY\u0092S SUPPLIERS ARE LOCATED IN JAPAN, AND CERTAIN OF ITS OTHER SUPPLIERS INTEGRATE COMPONENTS OR USE MATERIALS MANUFACTURED IN JAPAN IN THE PRODUCTION OF ITS PRODUCTS. TO THE EXTENT THAT COMPONENT\nPRODUCTION HAS BEEN AFFECTED, THE COMPANY HAS GENERALLY OBTAINED ALTERNATIVE SOURCES OF SUPPLY OR IMPLEMENTED OTHER MEASURES. THE COMPANY DOES NOT CURRENTLY BELIEVE THESE EVENTS WILL HAVE A MATERIAL IMPACT ON ITS OPERATIONS IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF\n2012 UNLESS CONDITIONS WORSEN, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, POWER OUTAGES AND EXPANSION OF EVACUATION ZONES AROUND THE NUCLEAR POWER PLANTS.\nBEYOND THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2012, UNCERTAINTY EXISTS WITH RESPECT TO THE AVAILABILITY OF ELECTRICAL POWER, THE DAMAGE TO NUCLEAR POWER PLANTS AND THE IMPACT TO OTHER INFRASTRUCTURE. THUS, THERE IS A RISK\nTHAT THE COMPANY COULD IN THE FUTURE EXPERIENCE DELAYS OR OTHER CONSTRAINTS IN OBTAINING KEY COMPONENTS AND PRODUCTS AND\/OR PRICE INCREASES RELATED TO SUCH COMPONENTS AND PRODUCTS THAT COULD MATERIALLY ADVERSELY AFFECT THE COMPANY\u0092S FINANCIAL\nCONDITION AND OPERATING RESULTS.\nIN ADDITION, IN RECENT MONTHS SEVERAL REGIONS OF THAILAND HAVE EXPERIENCED SEVERE FLOODING,\nCAUSING DAMAGE TO INFRASTRUCTURE, HOUSING AND FACTORIES. A NUMBER OF THE COMPANY\u0092S SUPPLIERS ARE LOCATED IN THAILAND. AS WITH JAPAN, TO THE EXTENT THAT COMPONENT PRODUCTION HAS BEEN AFFECTED, THE COMPANY WILL WORK TO OBTAIN ALTERNATIVE SOURCES\nOF SUPPLY OR IMPLEMENT OTHER MEASURES. BASED ON THE COMPANY\u0092S CURRENT ASSESSMENT OF THE SITUATION, IT DOES NOT BELIEVE THIS EVENT WILL HAVE A MATERIAL IMPACT ON ITS OPERATIONS IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2012; HOWEVER, BECAUSE THE SITUATION IN\nTHAILAND IS STILL EVOLVING UNCERTAINTY REMAINS REGARDING THE ULTIMATE IMPACT OF THIS EVENT ON THE COMPANY.\nCRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES\nAND ESTIMATES\nTHE PREPARATION OF FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND RELATED DISCLOSURES IN CONFORMITY WITH U.S. GENERALLY ACCEPTED\nACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES (\u0093GAAP\u0094) AND THE COMPANY\u0092S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF ITS FINANCIAL CONDITION AND OPERATING RESULTS REQUIRE THE COMPANY\u0092S MANAGEMENT TO MAKE JUDGMENTS, ASSUMPTIONS AND ESTIMATES THAT AFFECT THE AMOUNTS\nREPORTED IN ITS CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND ACCOMPANYING NOTES. NOTE 1, \u0093SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES\u0094 OF NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS IN THIS FORM 10-K DESCRIBES THE SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES\nAND METHODS USED IN THE PREPARATION OF THE COMPANY\u0092S CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS. MANAGEMENT BASES ITS ESTIMATES ON HISTORICAL EXPERIENCE AND ON VARIOUS OTHER ASSUMPTIONS IT BELIEVES TO BE REASONABLE UNDER THE CIRCUMSTANCES, THE RESULTS\nOF WHICH FORM THE BASIS FOR MAKING JUDGMENTS ABOUT THE CARRYING VALUES OF ASSETS AND LIABILITIES. ACTUAL RESULTS MAY DIFFER FROM THESE ESTIMATES AND SUCH DIFFERENCES MAY BE MATERIAL.\n26\nMANAGEMENT BELIEVES THE COMPANY\u0092S CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES ARE THOSE\nRELATED TO REVENUE RECOGNITION, VALUATION AND IMPAIRMENT OF MARKETABLE SECURITIES, INVENTORY VALUATION AND INVENTORY PURCHASE COMMITMENTS, WARRANTY COSTS, INCOME TAXES, AND LEGAL AND OTHER CONTINGENCIES. MANAGEMENT CONSIDERS THESE POLICIES CRITICAL\nBECAUSE THEY ARE BOTH IMPORTANT TO THE PORTRAYAL OF THE COMPANY\u0092S FINANCIAL CONDITION AND OPERATING RESULTS, AND THEY REQUIRE MANAGEMENT TO MAKE JUDGMENTS AND ESTIMATES ABOUT INHERENTLY UNCERTAIN MATTERS. THE COMPANY\u0092S SENIOR MANAGEMENT\nHAS REVIEWED THESE CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND RELATED DISCLOSURES WITH THE AUDIT AND FINANCE COMMITTEE OF THE COMPANY\u0092S BOARD OF DIRECTORS.\nREVENUE RECOGNITION\nNET SALES CONSIST PRIMARILY OF REVENUE FROM THE SALE\nOF HARDWARE, SOFTWARE, DIGITAL CONTENT AND APPLICATIONS, PERIPHERALS, AND SERVICE AND SUPPORT CONTRACTS. THE COMPANY RECOGNIZES REVENUE WHEN PERSUASIVE EVIDENCE OF AN ARRANGEMENT EXISTS, DELIVERY HAS OCCURRED, THE SALES PRICE IS FIXED OR\nDETERMINABLE, AND COLLECTION IS PROBABLE. PRODUCT IS CONSIDERED DELIVERED TO THE CUSTOMER ONCE IT HAS BEEN SHIPPED AND TITLE AND RISK OF LOSS HAVE BEEN TRANSFERRED. FOR MOST OF THE COMPANY\u0092S PRODUCT SALES, THESE CRITERIA ARE MET AT THE TIME THE\nPRODUCT IS SHIPPED. FOR ONLINE SALES TO INDIVIDUALS, FOR SOME SALES TO EDUCATION CUSTOMERS IN THE U.S., AND FOR CERTAIN OTHER SALES, THE COMPANY DEFERS RECOGNITION OF REVENUE UNTIL THE CUSTOMER RECEIVES THE PRODUCT BECAUSE THE COMPANY RETAINS A\nPORTION OF THE RISK OF LOSS ON THESE SALES DURING TRANSIT. THE COMPANY RECOGNIZES REVENUE FROM THE SALE OF HARDWARE PRODUCTS, SOFTWARE BUNDLED WITH HARDWARE THAT IS ESSENTIAL TO THE FUNCTIONALITY OF THE HARDWARE, AND THIRD-PARTY DIGITAL CONTENT SOLD\nON THE ITUNES STORE IN ACCORDANCE WITH GENERAL REVENUE RECOGNITION ACCOUNTING GUIDANCE. THE COMPANY RECOGNIZES REVENUE IN ACCORDANCE WITH INDUSTRY SPECIFIC SOFTWARE ACCOUNTING GUIDANCE FOR THE FOLLOWING TYPES OF SALES TRANSACTIONS.\n(I) STANDALONE SALES OF SOFTWARE PRODUCTS, (II) SALES OF SOFTWARE UPGRADES AND (III) SALES OF SOFTWARE BUNDLED WITH HARDWARE NOT ESSENTIAL TO THE FUNCTIONALITY OF THE HARDWARE.\nFOR MULTI-ELEMENT ARRANGEMENTS THAT INCLUDE HARDWARE PRODUCTS CONTAINING SOFTWARE ESSENTIAL TO THE HARDWARE PRODUCT\u0092S FUNCTIONALITY,\nUNDELIVERED SOFTWARE ELEMENTS THAT RELATE TO THE HARDWARE PRODUCT\u0092S ESSENTIAL SOFTWARE, AND UNDELIVERED NON-SOFTWARE SERVICES, THE COMPANY ALLOCATES REVENUE TO ALL DELIVERABLES BASED ON THEIR RELATIVE SELLING PRICES. IN SUCH CIRCUMSTANCES, THE\nCOMPANY USES A HIERARCHY TO DETERMINE THE SELLING PRICE TO BE USED FOR ALLOCATING REVENUE TO DELIVERABLES: (I) VENDOR-SPECIFIC OBJECTIVE EVIDENCE OF FAIR VALUE (\u0093VSOE\u0094), (II) THIRD-PARTY EVIDENCE OF SELLING PRICE\n(\u0093TPE\u0094) AND (III) BEST ESTIMATE OF THE SELLING PRICE (\u0093ESP\u0094). VSOE GENERALLY EXISTS ONLY WHEN THE COMPANY SELLS THE DELIVERABLE SEPARATELY AND IS THE PRICE ACTUALLY CHARGED BY THE COMPANY FOR THAT DELIVERABLE. ESPS REFLECT\nTHE COMPANY\u0092S BEST ESTIMATES OF WHAT THE SELLING PRICES OF ELEMENTS WOULD BE IF THEY WERE SOLD REGULARLY ON A STAND-ALONE BASIS.\nFOR SALES OF IPHONE, IPAD, APPLE TV, FOR SALES OF IPOD TOUCH BEGINNING IN JUNE 2010, AND FOR SALES OF MAC BEGINNING IN JUNE 2011, THE COMPANY HAS INDICATED IT MAY FROM TIME-TO-TIME PROVIDE FUTURE\nUNSPECIFIED SOFTWARE UPGRADES AND FEATURES FREE OF CHARGE TO CUSTOMERS. IN JUNE 2011, THE COMPANY ANNOUNCED IT WOULD BEGIN PROVIDING VARIOUS NON-SOFTWARE SERVICES TO OWNERS OF QUALIFYING VERSIONS OF IOS DEVICES AND MAC. BECAUSE THE COMPANY HAS\nNEITHER VSOE NOR TPE FOR THESE UNSPECIFIED SOFTWARE UPGRADE RIGHTS OR THE NON-SOFTWARE SERVICES, REVENUE IS ALLOCATED TO THESE RIGHTS AND SERVICES BASED ON THE COMPANY\u0092S ESPS. AMOUNTS ALLOCATED TO THE UNSPECIFIED SOFTWARE UPGRADE RIGHTS AND\nNON-SOFTWARE SERVICES ARE DEFERRED AND RECOGNIZED ON A STRAIGHT-LINE BASIS OVER THE ESTIMATED LIVES OF EACH OF THESE DEVICES, WHICH RANGE FROM 24 TO 48 MONTHS. THE COMPANY\u0092S PROCESS FOR DETERMINING ESPS INVOLVES MANAGEMENT\u0092S JUDGMENT. THE\nCOMPANY\u0092S PROCESS CONSIDERS MULTIPLE FACTORS THAT MAY VARY OVER TIME DEPENDING UPON THE UNIQUE FACTS AND CIRCUMSTANCES RELATED TO EACH DELIVERABLE. IF THE FACTS AND CIRCUMSTANCES UNDERLYING THE FACTORS CONSIDERED CHANGE, INCLUDING THE ESTIMATED\nOR ACTUAL COSTS INCURRED TO PROVIDE NON-SOFTWARE SERVICES OR THE ESTIMATED LIVES OF THE RELATED DEVICES, OR SHOULD FUTURE FACTS AND CIRCUMSTANCES LEAD THE COMPANY TO CONSIDER ADDITIONAL FACTORS, THE COMPANY\u0092S ESP FOR SOFTWARE UPGRADES AND\nNON-SOFTWARE SERVICES RELATED TO FUTURE SALES OF THESE DEVICES COULD CHANGE. IF THE ESTIMATED LIFE OF ONE OR MORE OF THE DEVICES SHOULD CHANGE, THE FUTURE RATE OF AMORTIZATION OF THE REVENUE ALLOCATED TO THE SOFTWARE UPGRADE RIGHTS WOULD ALSO\nCHANGE.\n27\nTHE COMPANY RECORDS REDUCTIONS TO REVENUE FOR ESTIMATED COMMITMENTS RELATED TO PRICE\nPROTECTION AND FOR CUSTOMER INCENTIVE PROGRAMS, INCLUDING RESELLER AND END-USER REBATES, AND OTHER SALES PROGRAMS AND VOLUME-BASED INCENTIVES. FOR TRANSACTIONS INVOLVING PRICE PROTECTION, THE COMPANY RECOGNIZES REVENUE NET OF THE ESTIMATED AMOUNT TO\nBE REFUNDED, PROVIDED THE REFUND AMOUNT CAN BE REASONABLY AND RELIABLY ESTIMATED AND THE OTHER CONDITIONS FOR REVENUE RECOGNITION HAVE BEEN MET. THE COMPANY\u0092S POLICY REQUIRES THAT, IF REFUNDS CANNOT BE RELIABLY ESTIMATED, REVENUE IS NOT\nRECOGNIZED UNTIL RELIABLE ESTIMATES CAN BE MADE OR THE PRICE PROTECTION LAPSES. FOR CUSTOMER INCENTIVE PROGRAMS, THE ESTIMATED COST OF THESE PROGRAMS IS RECOGNIZED AT THE LATER OF THE DATE AT WHICH THE COMPANY HAS SOLD THE PRODUCT OR THE DATE AT\nWHICH THE PROGRAM IS OFFERED. THE COMPANY ALSO RECORDS REDUCTIONS TO REVENUE FOR EXPECTED FUTURE PRODUCT RETURNS BASED ON THE COMPANY\u0092S HISTORICAL EXPERIENCE. FUTURE MARKET CONDITIONS AND PRODUCT TRANSITIONS MAY REQUIRE THE COMPANY TO INCREASE\nCUSTOMER INCENTIVE PROGRAMS AND INCUR INCREMENTAL PRICE PROTECTION OBLIGATIONS THAT COULD RESULT IN ADDITIONAL REDUCTIONS TO REVENUE AT THE TIME SUCH PROGRAMS ARE OFFERED. ADDITIONALLY, CERTAIN CUSTOMER INCENTIVE PROGRAMS REQUIRE MANAGEMENT TO\nESTIMATE THE NUMBER OF CUSTOMERS WHO WILL ACTUALLY REDEEM THE INCENTIVE. MANAGEMENT\u0092S ESTIMATES ARE BASED ON HISTORICAL EXPERIENCE AND THE SPECIFIC TERMS AND CONDITIONS OF PARTICULAR INCENTIVE PROGRAMS. IF A GREATER THAN ESTIMATED PROPORTION OF\nCUSTOMERS REDEEM SUCH INCENTIVES, THE COMPANY WOULD BE REQUIRED TO RECORD ADDITIONAL REDUCTIONS TO REVENUE, WHICH WOULD HAVE A NEGATIVE IMPACT ON THE COMPANY\u0092S RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.\nVALUATION AND IMPAIRMENT OF MARKETABLE SECURITIES\nTHE COMPANY\u0092S\nINVESTMENTS IN AVAILABLE-FOR-SALE SECURITIES ARE REPORTED AT FAIR VALUE. UNREALIZED GAINS AND LOSSES RELATED TO CHANGES IN THE FAIR VALUE OF SECURITIES ARE RECOGNIZED IN ACCUMULATED OTHER COMPREHENSIVE INCOME, NET OF TAX, IN THE COMPANY\u0092S\nCONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS. CHANGES IN THE FAIR VALUE OF AVAILABLE-FOR-SALE SECURITIES IMPACT THE COMPANY\u0092S NET INCOME ONLY WHEN SUCH SECURITIES ARE SOLD OR AN OTHER-THAN-TEMPORARY IMPAIRMENT IS RECOGNIZED. REALIZED GAINS AND LOSSES ON THE\nSALE OF SECURITIES ARE DETERMINED BY SPECIFIC IDENTIFICATION OF EACH SECURITY\u0092S COST BASIS. THE COMPANY REGULARLY REVIEWS ITS INVESTMENT PORTFOLIO TO DETERMINE IF ANY SECURITY IS OTHER-THAN-TEMPORARILY IMPAIRED, WHICH WOULD REQUIRE THE COMPANY\nTO RECORD AN IMPAIRMENT CHARGE IN THE PERIOD ANY SUCH DETERMINATION IS MADE. IN MAKING THIS JUDGMENT, THE COMPANY EVALUATES, AMONG OTHER THINGS, THE DURATION AND EXTENT TO WHICH THE FAIR VALUE OF A SECURITY IS LESS THAN ITS COST, THE FINANCIAL\nCONDITION OF THE ISSUER AND ANY CHANGES THERETO, AND THE COMPANY\u0092S INTENT TO SELL, OR WHETHER IT IS MORE LIKELY THAN NOT IT WILL BE REQUIRED TO SELL, THE SECURITY BEFORE RECOVERY OF THE ITS AMORTIZED COST BASIS. THE COMPANY\u0092S ASSESSMENT ON\nWHETHER A SECURITY IS OTHER-THAN-TEMPORARILY IMPAIRED, COULD CHANGE IN THE FUTURE DUE TO NEW DEVELOPMENTS OR CHANGES IN ASSUMPTIONS RELATED TO ANY PARTICULAR SECURITY.\nINVENTORY VALUATION AND INVENTORY PURCHASE COMMITMENTS\nTHE COMPANY MUST\nORDER COMPONENTS FOR ITS PRODUCTS AND BUILD INVENTORY IN ADVANCE OF PRODUCT SHIPMENTS. THE COMPANY RECORDS A WRITE-DOWN FOR INVENTORIES OF COMPONENTS AND PRODUCTS, INCLUDING THIRD-PARTY PRODUCTS HELD FOR RESALE, WHICH HAVE BECOME OBSOLETE OR ARE IN\nEXCESS OF ANTICIPATED DEMAND OR NET REALIZABLE VALUE. THE COMPANY PERFORMS A DETAILED REVIEW OF INVENTORY EACH FISCAL QUARTER THAT CONSIDERS MULTIPLE FACTORS INCLUDING DEMAND FORECASTS, PRODUCT LIFE CYCLE STATUS, PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT PLANS, CURRENT\nSALES LEVELS, AND COMPONENT COST TRENDS. THE INDUSTRIES IN WHICH THE COMPANY COMPETES ARE SUBJECT TO A RAPID AND UNPREDICTABLE PACE OF PRODUCT AND COMPONENT OBSOLESCENCE AND DEMAND CHANGES. IF FUTURE DEMAND OR MARKET CONDITIONS FOR THE\nCOMPANY\u0092S PRODUCTS ARE LESS FAVORABLE THAN FORECASTED OR IF UNFORESEEN TECHNOLOGICAL CHANGES NEGATIVELY IMPACT THE UTILITY OF COMPONENT INVENTORY, THE COMPANY MAY BE REQUIRED TO RECORD ADDITIONAL WRITE-DOWNS, WHICH WOULD NEGATIVELY AFFECT ITS\nRESULTS OF OPERATIONS IN THE PERIOD WHEN THE WRITE-DOWNS WERE RECORDED.\nTHE COMPANY RECORDS ACCRUALS FOR ESTIMATED\nCANCELLATION FEES RELATED TO COMPONENT ORDERS THAT HAVE BEEN CANCELLED OR ARE EXPECTED TO BE CANCELLED. CONSISTENT WITH INDUSTRY PRACTICE, THE COMPANY ACQUIRES COMPONENTS THROUGH A COMBINATION OF PURCHASE ORDERS, SUPPLIER CONTRACTS, AND OPEN ORDERS\nBASED ON PROJECTED DEMAND INFORMATION. THESE COMMITMENTS TYPICALLY COVER THE COMPANY\u0092S REQUIREMENTS FOR PERIODS UP TO 150 DAYS. IF THERE IS AN ABRUPT AND SUBSTANTIAL DECLINE IN DEMAND FOR ONE OR MORE OF THE COMPANY\u0092S PRODUCTS OR AN\nUNANTICIPATED CHANGE IN TECHNOLOGICAL REQUIREMENTS FOR ANY OF THE COMPANY\u0092S PRODUCTS, THE COMPANY MAY BE REQUIRED TO\n28\nRECORD ADDITIONAL ACCRUALS FOR CANCELLATION FEES THAT WOULD NEGATIVELY AFFECT ITS RESULTS OF OPERATIONS IN THE PERIOD WHEN THE CANCELLATION FEES ARE IDENTIFIED AND RECORDED.\nWARRANTY COSTS\nTHE\nCOMPANY PROVIDES FOR THE ESTIMATED COST OF HARDWARE AND SOFTWARE WARRANTIES AT THE TIME THE RELATED REVENUE IS RECOGNIZED BASED ON HISTORICAL AND PROJECTED WARRANTY CLAIM RATES, HISTORICAL AND PROJECTED COST-PER-CLAIM, AND KNOWLEDGE OF SPECIFIC\nPRODUCT FAILURES THAT ARE OUTSIDE OF THE COMPANY\u0092S TYPICAL EXPERIENCE. EACH QUARTER, THE COMPANY REEVALUATES ITS ESTIMATES TO ASSESS THE ADEQUACY OF ITS RECORDED WARRANTY LIABILITIES CONSIDERING THE SIZE OF THE INSTALLED BASE OF PRODUCTS\nSUBJECT TO WARRANTY PROTECTION AND ADJUSTS THE AMOUNTS AS NECESSARY. IF ACTUAL PRODUCT FAILURE RATES OR REPAIR COSTS DIFFER FROM ESTIMATES, REVISIONS TO THE ESTIMATED WARRANTY LIABILITY WOULD BE REQUIRED AND COULD MATERIALLY AFFECT THE\nCOMPANY\u0092S RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.\nINCOME TAXES\nTHE COMPANY RECORDS A TAX PROVISION FOR THE ANTICIPATED TAX CONSEQUENCES OF THE REPORTED RESULTS OF OPERATIONS. THE PROVISION FOR INCOME TAXES IS COMPUTED USING THE ASSET AND LIABILITY METHOD, UNDER WHICH\nDEFERRED TAX ASSETS AND LIABILITIES ARE RECOGNIZED FOR THE EXPECTED FUTURE TAX CONSEQUENCES OF TEMPORARY DIFFERENCES BETWEEN THE FINANCIAL REPORTING AND TAX BASES OF ASSETS AND LIABILITIES, AND FOR OPERATING LOSSES AND TAX CREDIT CARRYFORWARDS.\nDEFERRED TAX ASSETS AND LIABILITIES ARE MEASURED USING THE CURRENTLY ENACTED TAX RATES THAT APPLY TO TAXABLE INCOME IN EFFECT FOR THE YEARS IN WHICH THOSE TAX ASSETS ARE EXPECTED TO BE REALIZED OR SETTLED. THE COMPANY RECORDS A VALUATION ALLOWANCE\nTO REDUCE DEFERRED TAX ASSETS TO THE AMOUNT THAT IS BELIEVED MORE LIKELY THAN NOT TO BE REALIZED.\nTHE COMPANY RECOGNIZES TAX\nBENEFITS FROM UNCERTAIN TAX POSITIONS ONLY IF IT IS MORE LIKELY THAN NOT THAT THE TAX POSITION WILL BE SUSTAINED ON EXAMINATION BY THE TAXING AUTHORITIES, BASED ON THE TECHNICAL MERITS OF THE POSITION. THE TAX BENEFITS RECOGNIZED IN THE FINANCIAL\nSTATEMENTS FROM SUCH POSITIONS ARE THEN MEASURED BASED ON THE LARGEST BENEFIT THAT HAS A GREATER THAN 50% LIKELIHOOD OF BEING REALIZED UPON ULTIMATE SETTLEMENT.\nMANAGEMENT BELIEVES IT IS MORE LIKELY THAN NOT THAT FORECASTED INCOME, INCLUDING INCOME THAT MAY BE GENERATED AS A RESULT OF CERTAIN TAX PLANNING STRATEGIES, TOGETHER WITH FUTURE REVERSALS OF EXISTING\nTAXABLE TEMPORARY DIFFERENCES, WILL BE SUFFICIENT TO FULLY RECOVER THE DEFERRED TAX ASSETS. IN THE EVENT THAT THE COMPANY DETERMINES ALL OR PART OF THE NET DEFERRED TAX ASSETS ARE NOT REALIZABLE IN THE FUTURE, THE COMPANY WILL MAKE AN ADJUSTMENT TO\nTHE VALUATION ALLOWANCE THAT WOULD BE CHARGED TO EARNINGS IN THE PERIOD SUCH DETERMINATION IS MADE. IN ADDITION, THE CALCULATION OF TAX LIABILITIES INVOLVES SIGNIFICANT JUDGMENT IN ESTIMATING THE IMPACT OF UNCERTAINTIES IN THE APPLICATION OF GAAP\nAND COMPLEX TAX LAWS. RESOLUTION OF THESE UNCERTAINTIES IN A MANNER INCONSISTENT WITH MANAGEMENT\u0092S EXPECTATIONS COULD HAVE A MATERIAL IMPACT ON THE COMPANY\u0092S FINANCIAL CONDITION AND OPERATING RESULTS.\nLEGAL AND OTHER CONTINGENCIES\nAS DISCUSSED IN PART I, ITEM 3 OF THIS FORM 10-K UNDER THE HEADING \u0093LEGAL PROCEEDINGS\u0094 AND IN NOTE 7, \u0093COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES\u0094 IN NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL\nSTATEMENTS, THE COMPANY IS SUBJECT TO VARIOUS LEGAL PROCEEDINGS AND CLAIMS THAT ARISE IN THE ORDINARY COURSE OF BUSINESS. THE COMPANY RECORDS A LIABILITY WHEN IT IS PROBABLE THAT A LOSS HAS BEEN INCURRED AND THE AMOUNT IS REASONABLY ESTIMABLE. THERE\nIS SIGNIFICANT JUDGMENT REQUIRED IN BOTH THE PROBABILITY DETERMINATION AND AS TO WHETHER AN EXPOSURE CAN BE REASONABLY ESTIMATED. IN THE OPINION OF MANAGEMENT, THERE WAS NOT AT LEAST A REASONABLE POSSIBILITY THE COMPANY MAY HAVE INCURRED A MATERIAL\nLOSS, OR A MATERIAL LOSS IN EXCESS OF A RECORDED ACCRUAL, WITH RESPECT TO LOSS CONTINGENCIES. HOWEVER, THE OUTCOME OF LEGAL PROCEEDINGS AND CLAIMS BROUGHT AGAINST THE COMPANY ARE SUBJECT TO SIGNIFICANT UNCERTAINTY. THEREFORE, ALTHOUGH MANAGEMENT\nCONSIDERS THE LIKELIHOOD OF SUCH AN OUTCOME TO BE REMOTE, IF ONE OR MORE OF THESE LEGAL MATTERS WERE RESOLVED AGAINST THE COMPANY IN THE SAME REPORTING PERIOD FOR AMOUNTS IN EXCESS OF MANAGEMENT\u0092S EXPECTATIONS, THE COMPANY\u0092S CONSOLIDATED\nFINANCIAL STATEMENTS OF A PARTICULAR REPORTING PERIOD COULD BE MATERIALLY ADVERSELY AFFECTED.\n29\nNET SALES\nFISCAL YEARS 2011, 2010 AND 2009 EACH SPANNED 52 WEEKS. AN ADDITIONAL WEEK IS INCLUDED IN THE FIRST FISCAL QUARTER APPROXIMATELY EVERY SIX YEARS TO REALIGN FISCAL QUARTERS WITH CALENDAR QUARTERS. FISCAL\nYEAR 2012 WILL END ON SEPTEMBER 29, 2012 AND WILL SPAN 53 WEEKS, WITH A 14TH WEEK ADDED TO THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2012.\nTHE FOLLOWING TABLE SUMMARIZES NET SALES BY OPERATING SEGMENT AND NET SALES AND UNIT SALES BY PRODUCT DURING THE THREE YEARS ENDED\nSEPTEMBER 24, 2011 (IN MILLIONS, EXCEPT UNIT SALES IN THOUSANDS AND PER UNIT AMOUNTS).\n2011\nCHANGE\n2010\nCHANGE\n2009\nNET SALES BY OPERATING SEGMENT.\nAMERICAS NET SALES\n$38,315\n56%\n$24,498\n29%\n$18,981\nEUROPE NET SALES\n27,778\n49%\n18,692\n58%\n11,810\nJAPAN NET SALES\n5,437\n37%\n3,981\n75%\n2,279\nASIA-PACIFIC NET SALES\n22,592\n174%\n8,256\n160%\n3,179\nRETAIL NET SALES\n14,127\n44%\n9,798\n47%\n6,656\nTOTAL NET SALES\n$108,249\n66%\n$65,225\n52%\n$42,905\nNET SALES BY PRODUCT.\nDESKTOPS (A)\n$6,439\n4%\n$6,201\n43%\n$4,324\nPORTABLES (B)\n15,344\n36%\n11,278\n18%\n9,535\nTOTAL MAC NET SALES\n21,783\n25%\n17,479\n26%\n13,859\nIPOD\n7,453\n(10)%\n8,274\n2%\n8,091\nOTHER MUSIC RELATED PRODUCTS AND SERVICES (C)\n6,314\n28%\n4,948\n23%\n4,036\nIPHONE AND RELATED PRODUCTS AND SERVICES (D)\n47,057\n87%\n25,179\n93%\n13,033\nIPAD AND RELATED PRODUCTS AND SERVICES (E)\n20,358\n311%\n4,958\nNM\n0\nPERIPHERALS AND OTHER HARDWARE (F)\n2,330\n28%\n1,814\n23%\n1,475\nSOFTWARE, SERVICE AND OTHER SALES (G)\n2,954\n15%\n2,573\n7%\n2,411\nTOTAL NET SALES\n$108,249\n66%\n$65,225\n52%\n$42,905\nUNIT SALES BY PRODUCT.\nDESKTOPS (A)\n4,669\n1%\n4,627\n45%\n3,182\nPORTABLES (B)\n12,066\n34%\n9,035\n25%\n7,214\nTOTAL MAC UNIT SALES\n16,735\n22%\n13,662\n31%\n10,396\nIPOD UNIT SALES\n42,620\n(15)%\n50,312\n(7)%\n54,132\nIPHONE UNITS SOLD\n72,293\n81%\n39,989\n93%\n20,731\nIPAD UNITS SOLD\n32,394\n334%\n7,458\nNM\n0\n(A)\nINCLUDES IMAC, MAC MINI, MAC PRO AND XSERVE PRODUCT LINES.\n(B)\nINCLUDES MACBOOK, MACBOOK AIR AND MACBOOK PRO PRODUCT LINES.\n(C)\nINCLUDES SALES FROM THE ITUNES STORE, APP STORE, AND IBOOKSTORE IN ADDITION TO SALES OF IPOD SERVICES AND APPLE-BRANDED AND THIRD-PARTY IPOD\nACCESSORIES.\n(D)\nINCLUDES REVENUE RECOGNIZED FROM IPHONE SALES, CARRIER AGREEMENTS, SERVICES, AND APPLE-BRANDED AND THIRD-PARTY IPHONE ACCESSORIES.\n(E)\nINCLUDES REVENUE RECOGNIZED FROM IPAD SALES, SERVICES AND APPLE-BRANDED AND THIRD-PARTY IPAD ACCESSORIES.\n(F)\nINCLUDES SALES OF DISPLAYS, WIRELESS CONNECTIVITY AND NETWORKING SOLUTIONS, AND OTHER HARDWARE ACCESSORIES.\n(G)\nINCLUDES SALES FROM THE MAC APP STORE IN ADDITION TO SALES OF OTHER APPLE-BRANDED AND THIRD-PARTY MAC SOFTWARE AND MAC AND INTERNET SERVICES.\nNM\n= NOT MEANINGFUL\n30\nFISCAL YEAR 2011 VERSUS 2010\nNET SALES DURING 2011 INCREASED $43.0 BILLION OR 66% COMPARED TO 2010. SEVERAL FACTORS CONTRIBUTED POSITIVELY TO THIS INCREASE, INCLUDING\nTHE FOLLOWING.\n\u0095\nNET SALES OF IPHONE AND RELATED PRODUCTS AND SERVICES WERE $47.1 BILLION IN 2011, REPRESENTING AN INCREASE OF $21.9 BILLION OR 87% COMPARED TO 2010.\nIPHONE HANDSET UNIT SALES TOTALED 72.3 MILLION DURING 2011, REPRESENTING AN INCREASE OF 32.3 MILLION UNITS OR 81% COMPARED TO 2010. IPHONE YEAR-OVER-YEAR NET SALES GROWTH REFLECTED STRONG DEMAND FOR IPHONE 4 IN ALL OF THE COMPANY\u0092S\nOPERATING SEGMENTS. THE EXPANDED U.S. DISTRIBUTION OF IPHONE TO THE VERIZON WIRELESS NETWORK BEGINNING IN FEBRUARY 2011, CONTINUED EXPANSION INTO NEW COUNTRIES, AND INCREASED DISTRIBUTION WITH OTHER NEW CARRIERS AND RESELLERS ALSO CONTRIBUTED TO THE\nYEAR-OVER-YEAR GROWTH OF IPHONE. AS OF SEPTEMBER 24, 2011, THE COMPANY DISTRIBUTED IPHONE IN 105 COUNTRIES THROUGH 228 CARRIERS. ADDITIONALLY, THE COMPANY DISTRIBUTES IPHONE THROUGH ITS DIRECT CHANNELS AND CERTAIN THIRD-PARTY RESELLERS. NET\nSALES OF IPHONE AND RELATED PRODUCTS AND SERVICES ACCOUNTED FOR 43% OF THE COMPANY\u0092S TOTAL NET SALES FOR 2011.\n\u0095\nNET SALES OF IPAD AND RELATED PRODUCTS AND SERVICES, WHICH THE COMPANY INTRODUCED IN THE THIRD QUARTER OF 2010, WERE $20.4 BILLION IN 2011,\nREPRESENTING AN INCREASE OF $15.4 BILLION OR 311% COMPARED TO 2010. UNIT SALES OF IPAD WERE 32.4 MILLION DURING 2011, AN INCREASE OF 334% FROM 2010. THE YEAR-OVER-YEAR UNIT GROWTH AND NET SALES GROWTH WERE DRIVEN BY STRONG IPAD DEMAND IN ALL OF\nTHE COMPANY\u0092S OPERATING SEGMENTS. THE COMPANY DISTRIBUTES IPAD THROUGH ITS DIRECT CHANNELS, CERTAIN CELLULAR NETWORK CARRIERS\u0092 DISTRIBUTION CHANNELS AND CERTAIN THIRD-PARTY RESELLERS. THE COMPANY DISTRIBUTED IPAD IN 90 COUNTRIES AS OF\nSEPTEMBER 24, 2011 COMPARED TO 26 COUNTRIES AS OF SEPTEMBER 25, 2010. NET SALES OF IPAD AND RELATED PRODUCTS AND SERVICES ACCOUNTED FOR 19% OF THE COMPANY\u0092S TOTAL NET SALES FOR 2011.\n\u0095\nMAC NET SALES WERE $21.8 BILLION IN 2011, REPRESENTING AN INCREASE OF $4.3 BILLION OR 25% COMPARED TO 2010. MAC UNIT SALES INCREASED BY\n3.1 MILLION OR 22% IN 2011 COMPARED TO 2010. THE YEAR-OVER-YEAR GROWTH IN MAC NET SALES AND UNIT SALES WAS DUE PRIMARILY TO HIGHER DEMAND IN ALL OF THE COMPANY\u0092S OPERATING SEGMENTS FOR MACBOOK AIR AND MACBOOK PRO, WHICH WERE UPDATED IN\nJULY 2011 AND FEBRUARY 2011, RESPECTIVELY. THE YEAR-OVER-YEAR REVENUE GROWTH FOR PORTABLES AND DESKTOPS WAS 36% AND 4%, RESPECTIVELY. NET SALES OF THE COMPANY\u0092S MACS ACCOUNTED FOR 20% OF THE COMPANY\u0092S TOTAL NET SALES FOR 2011.\n\u0095\nNET SALES OF OTHER MUSIC RELATED PRODUCTS AND SERVICES WERE $6.3 BILLION IN 2011, REPRESENTING AN INCREASE OF $1.4 BILLION OR 28% COMPARED TO 2010.\nTHE INCREASE WAS DUE PRIMARILY TO INCREASED NET SALES FROM THE ITUNES STORE, WHICH WAS LARGELY DRIVEN BY APP STORE EXPANSION INTO NEW COUNTRIES THAT CONTRIBUTED TO STRONG GROWTH IN ALL OF THE COMPANY\u0092S GEOGRAPHIC SEGMENTS. DURING 2011, THE\nCOMBINED NET SALES FOR THE ITUNES STORE, APP STORE AND IBOOKSTORE WAS $5.4 BILLION, REPRESENTING AN INCREASE OF 33% COMPARED TO 2010. THE COMPANY BELIEVES THIS CONTINUED GROWTH IS THE RESULT OF HEIGHTENED CONSUMER INTEREST IN DOWNLOADING THIRD-PARTY\nDIGITAL CONTENT, CONTINUED GROWTH IN ITS CUSTOMER BASE OF IPHONE, IPAD AND IPOD, EXPANSION OF THIRD-PARTY AUDIO AND VIDEO CONTENT AVAILABLE VIA THE ITUNES STORE, AND CONTINUED INTEREST IN AND GROWTH OF THE APP STORE. NET SALES OF OTHER MUSIC RELATED\nPRODUCTS AND SERVICES ACCOUNTED FOR 6% OF THE COMPANY\u0092S TOTAL NET SALES FOR 2011.\nPARTIALLY OFFSETTING\nTHE POSITIVE FACTORS CONTRIBUTING TO THE OVERALL INCREASE IN NET SALES WAS A DECREASE IN IPOD NET SALES OF $821 MILLION OR 10% DURING 2011 COMPARED TO 2010. SIMILARLY, IPOD UNIT SALES DECREASED BY 15% IN 2011 COMPARED TO 2010. HOWEVER, NET SALES PER\nIPOD UNIT SOLD INCREASED DURING 2011 COMPARED TO 2010 DUE PRIMARILY TO A SHIFT IN IPOD PRODUCT MIX TOWARD IPOD TOUCH. NET SALES OF IPOD ACCOUNTED FOR 7% OF THE COMPANY\u0092S TOTAL NET SALES FOR 2011.\n31\nFISCAL YEAR 2010 VERSUS 2009\nNET SALES DURING 2010 INCREASED $22.3 BILLION OR 52% COMPARED TO 2009. SEVERAL FACTORS CONTRIBUTED POSITIVELY TO THIS INCREASE, INCLUDING\nTHE FOLLOWING.\n\u0095\nNET SALES OF IPHONE AND RELATED PRODUCTS AND SERVICES WERE $25.2 BILLION IN 2010 REPRESENTING AN INCREASE OF $12.1 BILLION OR 93% COMPARED TO 2009.\nIPHONE UNIT SALES TOTALED 40 MILLION IN 2010, WHICH REPRESENTS AN INCREASE OF 19.3 MILLION OR 93% COMPARED TO 2009. IPHONE YEAR-OVER-YEAR GROWTH WAS ATTRIBUTABLE PRIMARILY TO CONTINUED GROWTH FROM EXISTING CARRIERS, EXPANDED DISTRIBUTION\nWITH NEW INTERNATIONAL CARRIERS AND RESELLERS, AND STRONG DEMAND FOR IPHONE 4, WHICH WAS RELEASED IN THE U.S. IN JUNE 2010 AND IN MANY OTHER COUNTRIES OVER THE REMAINDER OF 2010. AS OF SEPTEMBER 25, 2010, THE COMPANY DISTRIBUTED IPHONE IN 89\nCOUNTRIES THROUGH 166 CARRIERS. NET SALES OF IPHONE AND RELATED PRODUCTS AND SERVICES ACCOUNTED FOR 39% OF THE COMPANY\u0092S TOTAL NET SALES FOR 2010 COMPARED TO 30% IN 2009.\n\u0095\nNET SALES OF IPAD AND RELATED PRODUCTS AND SERVICES WERE $5.0 BILLION AND UNIT SALES OF IPAD WERE 7.5 MILLION DURING 2010. IPAD WAS RELEASED IN\nTHE U.S. IN APRIL 2010 AND IN VARIOUS OTHER COUNTRIES OVER THE REMAINDER OF 2010. AS OF SEPTEMBER 25, 2010, THE COMPANY DISTRIBUTED IPAD IN 26 COUNTRIES. THE COMPANY DISTRIBUTES IPAD THROUGH ITS DIRECT CHANNELS, CERTAIN CELLULAR NETWORK\nCARRIERS\u0092 DISTRIBUTION CHANNELS AND CERTAIN THIRD-PARTY RESELLERS. NET SALES OF IPAD AND RELATED PRODUCTS AND SERVICES ACCOUNTED FOR 8% OF THE COMPANY\u0092S TOTAL NET SALES FOR 2010, REFLECTING THE STRONG DEMAND FOR IPAD DURING THE FIVE MONTHS\nFOLLOWING ITS RELEASE.\n\u0095\nMAC NET SALES INCREASED BY $3.6 BILLION OR 26% IN 2010 COMPARED TO 2009, AND MAC UNIT SALES INCREASED BY 3.3 MILLION OR 31% IN 2010 COMPARED TO\n2009. NET SALES PER MAC UNIT SOLD DECREASED BY 4% IN 2010 COMPARED TO 2009 DUE PRIMARILY TO LOWER AVERAGE SELLING PRICES OF MAC PORTABLE SYSTEMS.

THE PRIMARY CONTRIBUTORS TO THE GROWTH IN NET SALES WAS A SIGNIFICANT YEAR-OVER-YEAR INCREASE IN IPHONE REVENUE FROM CARRIER EXPANSION AND STRONG DEMAND FOR IPHONE 4\nAND INCREASED SALES OF IPAD AND MACS, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY A DECREASE IN IPOD NET SALES. HIGHER SALES OF THIRD-PARTY DIGITAL CONTENT AND APPLICATIONS FROM THE ITUNES STORE AND APP STORE ALSO DROVE AN INCREASE IN SALES DURING 2011.

THE INCREASE IN NET SALES DURING 2011 WAS ATTRIBUTABLE PRIMARILY TO THE CONTINUED YEAR-OVER-YEAR INCREASE IN IPHONE REVENUE FROM CARRIER EXPANSION AND STRONG DEMAND FOR IPHONE 4, AND INCREASED SALES OF IPAD AND MACS, PARTIALLY\nOFFSET BY A DECREASE IN IPOD NET SALES. THE EUROPE SEGMENT REPRESENTED 26% AND 29% OF TOTAL NET SALES FOR 2011 AND 2010, RESPECTIVELY.\nDURING 2010, NET SALES IN EUROPE INCREASED $6.9 BILLION OR 58% COMPARED TO 2009.

THE EUROPE SEGMENT REPRESENTED 29% AND 28% OF THE COMPANY\u0092S TOTAL\nNET SALES IN 2010 AND 2009, RESPECTIVELY.\nJAPAN\nJAPAN\u0092S NET SALES INCREASED $1.5 BILLION OR 37% DURING 2011 COMPARED TO 2010. THE KEY CONTRIBUTORS TO JAPAN\u0092S NET SALES GROWTH WERE INCREASED IPHONE REVENUE, STRONG SALES OF IPAD, INCREASED\nSALES OF MACS, AND STRENGTH IN THE JAPANESE YEN RELATIVE TO THE U.S. DOLLAR. THE JAPAN SEGMENT REPRESENTED 5% AND 6% OF TOTAL NET SALES FOR 2011 AND 2010, RESPECTIVELY.\nTHE RECENT EARTHQUAKES AND TSUNAMI THAT STRUCK THE NORTHEAST COAST OF JAPAN HAVE CREATED UNCERTAINTY REGARDING GENERAL ECONOMIC AND MARKET CONDITIONS IN JAPAN. ANY SIGNIFICANT IMPACT OF THESE EVENTS ON\nCONSUMER DEMAND COULD NEGATIVELY IMPACT THE COMPANY\u0092S NET SALES IN JAPAN IN THE FUTURE. THE COMPANY DOES NOT CURRENTLY BELIEVE THAT THE IMPACT OF THESE EVENTS WILL HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON THE COMPANY OR ITS RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.\nDURING 2010, JAPAN\u0092S NET SALES INCREASED $1.7 BILLION OR 75% COMPARED TO 2009.

THE SIGNIFICANT GROWTH IN ASIA-PACIFIC NET SALES\nWAS DUE MAINLY TO INCREASED IPHONE REVENUE, WHICH WAS PRIMARILY ATTRIBUTABLE TO COUNTRY AND CARRIER EXPANSION AND CONTINUED GROWTH FROM EXISTING CARRIERS. ASIA-PACIFIC NET SALES WERE ALSO FAVORABLY AFFECTED BY STRONG DEMAND FOR MAC PORTABLE AND\nDESKTOP SYSTEMS AND FOR IPAD. PARTICULARLY STRONG YEAR-OVER-YEAR GROWTH WAS EXPERIENCED IN CHINA, KOREA AND AUSTRALIA. THE ASIA-PACIFIC SEGMENT REPRESENTED 13% AND 7% OF THE COMPANY\u0092S TOTAL NET SALES FOR 2010 AND 2009, RESPECTIVELY.\nRETAIL\nRETAIL SEGMENT\nNET SALES INCREASED $4.3 BILLION OR 44% DURING 2011 COMPARED TO 2010. THE INCREASE IN NET SALES WAS DRIVEN PRIMARILY BY STRONG DEMAND FOR IPAD, HIGHER SALES OF MACS, AND AN INCREASE IN IPHONE REVENUE. THE COMPANY OPENED 40 NEW RETAIL STORES DURING\n2011, 28 OF WHICH WERE OUTSIDE THE U.S., ENDING THE YEAR WITH 357 STORES OPEN COMPARED TO 317 STORES AT THE END OF 2010. AS OF SEPTEMBER 24, 2011, THE COMPANY HAD A TOTAL OF 245 U.S. RETAIL STORES AND 112 INTERNATIONAL RETAIL STORES.\nDURING 2011, THE COMPANY HAD AN AVERAGE OF 326 STORES COMPARED TO AN AVERAGE OF 288 STORES DURING 2010.

THE YEAR-OVER-YEAR INCREASE IN RETAIL OPERATING INCOME WAS PRIMARILY ATTRIBUTABLE TO HIGHER OVERALL NET SALES THAT RESULTED IN SIGNIFICANTLY HIGHER AVERAGE\nREVENUE PER STORE DURING 2011 COMPARED TO 2010. THE RETAIL SEGMENT REPORTED OPERATING INCOME OF $1.7 BILLION DURING 2009. THE INCREASE IN RETAIL OPERATING INCOME DURING 2010 COMPARED TO 2009 WAS ATTRIBUTABLE TO HIGHER OVERALL NET SALES.\nEXPANSION OF THE RETAIL SEGMENT HAS REQUIRED AND WILL CONTINUE TO REQUIRE A SUBSTANTIAL INVESTMENT IN FIXED ASSETS AND RELATED\nINFRASTRUCTURE, OPERATING LEASE COMMITMENTS, PERSONNEL, AND OTHER OPERATING EXPENSES. CAPITAL ASSET PURCHASES ASSOCIATED WITH THE RETAIL SEGMENT SINCE INCEPTION TOTALED $2.8 BILLION THROUGH THE END OF 2011. AS OF SEPTEMBER 24, 2011, THE RETAIL\nSEGMENT HAD APPROXIMATELY 36,000 FULL-TIME EQUIVALENT EMPLOYEES AND HAD OUTSTANDING LEASE COMMITMENTS ASSOCIATED WITH RETAIL SPACE AND RELATED FACILITIES OF $2.4 BILLION.

THIS YEAR-OVER-YEAR INCREASE IN\nGROSS MARGIN WAS LARGELY DRIVEN BY LOWER COMMODITY AND OTHER PRODUCT COSTS.\nTHE GROSS MARGIN PERCENTAGE IN 2010 WAS 39.4%\nCOMPARED TO 40.1% IN 2009. THIS YEAR-OVER-YEAR DECLINE IN GROSS MARGIN WAS PRIMARILY ATTRIBUTABLE TO NEW PRODUCTS THAT HAD HIGHER COST STRUCTURES, INCLUDING IPAD, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY A MORE FAVORABLE SALES MIX OF IPHONE, WHICH HAD A HIGHER GROSS\nMARGIN THAN THE COMPANY AVERAGE.\nTHE COMPANY EXPECTS TO EXPERIENCE DECREASES IN ITS GROSS MARGIN PERCENTAGE IN FUTURE\nPERIODS, AS COMPARED TO LEVELS ACHIEVED DURING 2011, LARGELY DUE TO A HIGHER MIX OF NEW AND INNOVATIVE PRODUCTS WITH FLAT OR REDUCED PRICING THAT HAVE HIGHER COST STRUCTURES AND DELIVER GREATER VALUE TO CUSTOMERS, AND POTENTIAL FUTURE COMPONENT COST\nAND OTHER COST INCREASES.\nTHE FOREGOING STATEMENTS REGARDING THE COMPANY\u0092S EXPECTED GROSS MARGIN PERCENTAGE ARE\nFORWARD-LOOKING AND COULD DIFFER FROM ANTICIPATED LEVELS BECAUSE OF SEVERAL FACTORS INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO CERTAIN OF THOSE SET FORTH BELOW IN PART I, ITEM 1A, \u0093RISK FACTORS\u0094 UNDER THE SUBHEADING \u0093\nFUTURE\nOPERATING RESULTS DEPEND UPON THE COMPANY\u0092S ABILITY TO OBTAIN COMPONENTS IN SUFFICIENT QUANTITIES\n,\u0094 WHICH IS INCORPORATED HEREIN BY REFERENCE. IN GENERAL, GROSS MARGINS AND MARGINS ON INDIVIDUAL PRODUCTS WILL REMAIN UNDER\nDOWNWARD PRESSURE DUE TO A VARIETY OF FACTORS, INCLUDING CONTINUED INDUSTRY WIDE GLOBAL PRODUCT PRICING PRESSURES, INCREASED COMPETITION, COMPRESSED PRODUCT LIFE CYCLES, PRODUCT TRANSITIONS AND POTENTIAL INCREASES IN THE COST OF COMPONENTS, AS WELL\nAS POTENTIAL INCREASES IN THE COSTS OF OUTSIDE MANUFACTURING SERVICES AND A POTENTIAL SHIFT IN THE COMPANY\u0092S SALES MIX TOWARDS PRODUCTS WITH LOWER GROSS MARGINS. IN RESPONSE TO THESE COMPETITIVE PRESSURES, THE COMPANY EXPECTS IT WILL CONTINUE\nTO TAKE PRODUCT PRICING ACTIONS, WHICH WOULD ADVERSELY AFFECT GROSS MARGINS. GROSS MARGINS COULD ALSO BE AFFECTED BY THE COMPANY\u0092S ABILITY TO MANAGE PRODUCT QUALITY AND WARRANTY COSTS EFFECTIVELY AND TO STIMULATE DEMAND FOR CERTAIN OF ITS\nPRODUCTS. DUE TO THE COMPANY\u0092S SIGNIFICANT INTERNATIONAL OPERATIONS, FINANCIAL RESULTS CAN BE SIGNIFICANTLY AFFECTED IN THE SHORT-TERM BY FLUCTUATIONS IN EXCHANGE RATES.\nOPERATING EXPENSES\nOPERATING EXPENSES FOR THE THREE YEARS ENDED\nSEPTEMBER 24, 2011, ARE AS FOLLOWS (IN MILLIONS, EXCEPT FOR PERCENTAGES).\n2011\n2010\n2009\nRESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT\n$2,429\n$1,782\n$1,333\nPERCENTAGE OF NET SALES\n2%\n3%\n3%\nSELLING, GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE\n$7,599\n$5,517\n$4,149\nPERCENTAGE OF NET SALES\n7%\n8%\n10%\nRESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT EXPENSE (\u0093R&D\u0094)\nR&D EXPENSE INCREASED $647 MILLION OR 36% TO $2.4 BILLION IN 2011 COMPARED TO 2010. THIS INCREASE WAS DUE PRIMARILY TO AN INCREASE IN\nHEADCOUNT AND RELATED EXPENSES TO SUPPORT EXPANDED R&D ACTIVITIES. ALTHOUGH TOTAL\n35\nR&D EXPENSE INCREASED 36% DURING 2011 COMPARED TO 2010, IT DECLINED SLIGHTLY AS A PERCENTAGE OF NET SALES, DUE TO THE 66% YEAR-OVER-YEAR GROWTH IN THE COMPANY\u0092S NET SALES DURING 2011.\nR&D EXPENSE INCREASED 34% OR $449 MILLION TO $1.8 BILLION IN 2010 COMPARED TO 2009. THIS INCREASE WAS DUE PRIMARILY TO AN\nINCREASE IN HEADCOUNT AND RELATED EXPENSES IN THE CURRENT YEAR TO SUPPORT EXPANDED R&D ACTIVITIES. ALSO CONTRIBUTING TO THIS INCREASE IN R&D EXPENSE IN 2010 WAS THE CAPITALIZATION IN 2009 OF SOFTWARE DEVELOPMENT COSTS OF $71 MILLION RELATED\nTO MAC OS X SNOW LEOPARD. ALTHOUGH TOTAL R&D EXPENSE INCREASED 34% DURING 2010, IT DECLINED AS A PERCENTAGE OF NET SALES GIVEN THE 52% YEAR-OVER-YEAR INCREASE IN NET SALES IN 2010.\nTHE COMPANY CONTINUES TO BELIEVE THAT FOCUSED INVESTMENTS IN R&D ARE CRITICAL TO ITS FUTURE GROWTH AND COMPETITIVE POSITION IN THE\nMARKETPLACE AND ARE DIRECTLY RELATED TO TIMELY DEVELOPMENT OF NEW AND ENHANCED PRODUCTS THAT ARE CENTRAL TO THE COMPANY\u0092S CORE BUSINESS STRATEGY. AS SUCH, THE COMPANY EXPECTS TO MAKE FURTHER INVESTMENTS IN R&D TO REMAIN COMPETITIVE.\nSELLING, GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSE (\u0093SG&A\u0094)\nSG&A EXPENSE INCREASED $2.1 BILLION OR 38% TO $7.6 BILLION DURING 2011 COMPARED TO 2010. THIS INCREASE WAS DUE PRIMARILY TO THE\nCOMPANY\u0092S CONTINUED EXPANSION OF ITS RETAIL SEGMENT, INCREASED HEADCOUNT AND RELATED COSTS, HIGHER SPENDING ON PROFESSIONAL SERVICES AND MARKETING AND ADVERTISING PROGRAMS, AND INCREASED VARIABLE COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH THE OVERALL GROWTH OF THE\nCOMPANY\u0092S NET SALES.\nSG&A EXPENSE INCREASED $1.4 BILLION OR 33% TO $5.5 BILLION IN 2010 COMPARED TO 2009. THIS\nINCREASE WAS DUE PRIMARILY TO THE COMPANY\u0092S CONTINUED EXPANSION OF ITS RETAIL SEGMENT, HIGHER SPENDING ON MARKETING AND ADVERTISING PROGRAMS, INCREASED SHARE-BASED COMPENSATION EXPENSES AND VARIABLE COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH THE OVERALL GROWTH OF\nTHE COMPANY\u0092S NET SALES.\nOTHER INCOME AND EXPENSE\nOTHER INCOME AND EXPENSE FOR THE THREE YEARS ENDED SEPTEMBER 24, 2011, ARE AS FOLLOWS (IN MILLIONS).\n2011\n2010\n2009\nINTEREST AND DIVIDEND INCOME\n$519\n$311\n$407\nOTHER EXPENSE, NET\n(104\n)\n(156\n)\n(81\n)\nTOTAL OTHER INCOME AND EXPENSE\n$415\n$155\n$326\nTOTAL OTHER INCOME AND EXPENSE INCREASED $260 MILLION OR 168% TO $415 MILLION DURING 2011 COMPARED TO\n$155 MILLION AND $326 MILLION IN 2010 AND 2009, RESPECTIVELY. THE YEAR-OVER-YEAR INCREASE IN OTHER INCOME AND EXPENSE DURING 2011 WAS DUE PRIMARILY TO HIGHER INTEREST INCOME AND NET REALIZED GAINS ON SALES OF MARKETABLE SECURITIES. THE OVERALL\nDECREASE IN OTHER INCOME AND EXPENSE IN 2010 COMPARED TO 2009 WAS ATTRIBUTABLE TO THE SIGNIFICANT DECLINES IN INTEREST RATES ON A YEAR-OVER-YEAR BASIS, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY THE COMPANY\u0092S HIGHER CASH, CASH EQUIVALENTS AND MARKETABLE SECURITIES\nBALANCES. ADDITIONALLY THE COMPANY INCURRED HIGHER PREMIUM EXPENSES ON ITS FOREIGN EXCHANGE OPTION CONTRACTS, WHICH FURTHER REDUCED THE TOTAL OTHER INCOME AND EXPENSE. THE WEIGHTED AVERAGE INTEREST RATE EARNED BY THE COMPANY ON ITS CASH, CASH\nEQUIVALENTS AND MARKETABLE SECURITIES WAS 0.77%, 0.75% AND 1.43% DURING 2011, 2010 AND 2009, RESPECTIVELY. DURING 2011, 2010 AND 2009, THE COMPANY HAD NO DEBT OUTSTANDING AND ACCORDINGLY DID NOT INCUR ANY RELATED INTEREST EXPENSE.\nPROVISION FOR INCOME TAXES\nTHE COMPANY\u0092S EFFECTIVE TAX RATES WERE APPROXIMATELY 24.2%, 24.4% AND 31.8% FOR 2011, 2010 AND 2009, RESPECTIVELY. THE COMPANY\u0092S EFFECTIVE RATES FOR THESE PERIODS DIFFER FROM THE STATUTORY\nFEDERAL INCOME TAX RATE OF\n36\n35% DUE PRIMARILY TO CERTAIN UNDISTRIBUTED FOREIGN EARNINGS FOR WHICH NO U.S. TAXES ARE PROVIDED BECAUSE SUCH EARNINGS ARE INTENDED TO BE INDEFINITELY REINVESTED OUTSIDE THE U.S.\nAS OF SEPTEMBER 24, 2011, THE COMPANY HAD DEFERRED TAX ASSETS ARISING FROM DEDUCTIBLE TEMPORARY DIFFERENCES, TAX LOSSES, AND TAX\nCREDITS OF $3.2 BILLION, AND DEFERRED TAX LIABILITIES OF $9.2 BILLION. MANAGEMENT BELIEVES IT IS MORE LIKELY THAN NOT THAT FORECASTED INCOME, INCLUDING INCOME THAT MAY BE GENERATED AS A RESULT OF CERTAIN TAX PLANNING STRATEGIES, TOGETHER WITH FUTURE\nREVERSALS OF EXISTING TAXABLE TEMPORARY DIFFERENCES, WILL BE SUFFICIENT TO FULLY RECOVER THE DEFERRED TAX ASSETS. THE COMPANY WILL CONTINUE TO EVALUATE THE REALIZABILITY OF DEFERRED TAX ASSETS QUARTERLY BY ASSESSING THE NEED FOR AND AMOUNT OF A\nVALUATION ALLOWANCE.\nTHE INTERNAL REVENUE SERVICE (THE \u0093IRS\u0094) HAS COMPLETED ITS FIELD AUDIT OF THE COMPANY\u0092S\nFEDERAL INCOME TAX RETURNS FOR THE YEARS 2004 THROUGH 2006 AND PROPOSED CERTAIN ADJUSTMENTS. THE COMPANY HAS CONTESTED CERTAIN OF THESE ADJUSTMENTS THROUGH THE IRS APPEALS OFFICE. THE IRS IS CURRENTLY EXAMINING THE YEARS 2007 THROUGH 2009. ALL IRS\nAUDIT ISSUES FOR YEARS PRIOR TO 2004 HAVE BEEN RESOLVED. IN ADDITION, THE COMPANY IS SUBJECT TO AUDITS BY STATE, LOCAL, AND FOREIGN TAX AUTHORITIES. MANAGEMENT BELIEVES THAT ADEQUATE PROVISIONS HAVE BEEN MADE FOR ANY ADJUSTMENTS THAT MAY RESULT\nFROM TAX EXAMINATIONS. HOWEVER, THE OUTCOME OF TAX AUDITS CANNOT BE PREDICTED WITH CERTAINTY. IF ANY ISSUES ADDRESSED IN THE COMPANY\u0092S TAX AUDITS ARE RESOLVED IN A MANNER NOT CONSISTENT WITH MANAGEMENT\u0092S EXPECTATIONS, THE COMPANY COULD BE\nREQUIRED TO ADJUST ITS PROVISION FOR INCOME TAXES IN THE PERIOD SUCH RESOLUTION OCCURS.\nLIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES\nTHE FOLLOWING TABLE PRESENTS SELECTED FINANCIAL INFORMATION AND STATISTICS AS OF AND FOR THE THREE YEARS ENDED SEPTEMBER 24, 2011 (IN\nMILLIONS).\n2011\n2010\n2009\nCASH, CASH EQUIVALENTS AND MARKETABLE SECURITIES\n$81,570\n$51,011\n$33,992\nACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE, NET\n$5,369\n$5,510\n$3,361\nINVENTORIES\n$776\n$1,051\n$455\nWORKING CAPITAL\n$17,018\n$20,956\n$20,049\nANNUAL OPERATING CASH FLOW\n$37,529\n$18,595\n$10,159\nCASH, CASH EQUIVALENTS AND MARKETABLE SECURITIES INCREASED $30.6 BILLION OR 60% DURING 2011.

THESE INCLUDE PROGRAMS\nTHROUGH WHICH WE DISTRIBUTE OUR ADVERTISERS\u0092 ADWORDS ADS FOR DISPLAY ON THE WEBSITES OF OUR GOOGLE NETWORK MEMBERS. WE SHARE MOST OF THE FEES THESE ADS GENERATE WITH OUR GOOGLE NETWORK MEMBERS, THEREBY CREATING AN IMPORTANT REVENUE STREAM FOR\nTHEM. IN ADDITION, WE HAVE ENTERED INTO ARRANGEMENTS WITH OTHER CONTENT PROVIDERS UNDER WHICH WE DISTRIBUTE OR LICENSE THEIR VIDEO AND OTHER CONTENT, AND WE MAY DISPLAY ADS NEXT TO OR AS PART OF THIS CONTENT ON THE PAGES OF OUR WEBSITES. WE SHARE\nMOST OF THE FEES THESE ADS GENERATE WITH THESE CONTENT PROVIDERS, THEREBY CREATING AN IMPORTANT REVENUE STREAM FOR THESE PARTNERS.\nRECENT DEVELOPMENT\nON AUGUST 15, 2011, WE ENTERED\nINTO THE MERGER AGREEMENT WITH MOTOROLA, A PROVIDER OF INNOVATIVE TECHNOLOGIES, PRODUCTS AND SERVICES THAT ENABLE A RANGE OF MOBILE AND WIRELINE DIGITAL COMMUNICATION, INFORMATION AND ENTERTAINMENT EXPERIENCES, UNDER WHICH WE WILL ACQUIRE MOTOROLA\nFOR $40 PER SHARE IN CASH, OR A TOTAL OF APPROXIMATELY $12.5 BILLION IN CASH. THE COMPLETION OF THIS TRANSACTION IS SUBJECT TO CUSTOMARY CLOSING CONDITIONS, INCLUDING THE RECEIPT OF CERTAIN REGULATORY APPROVALS.\nHOW WE GENERATE REVENUE\nADVERTISING REVENUES MADE\nUP 97% OF OUR REVENUES IN 2009 AND 96% OF OUR REVENUES IN 2010 AND 2011. WE DERIVE MOST OF OUR ADDITIONAL REVENUES FROM OUR ENTERPRISE PRODUCTS, AS WELL AS OUR DISPLAY ADVERTISING MANAGEMENT SERVICES TO ADVERTISERS, AD AGENCIES, AND PUBLISHERS.\nGOOGLE ADWORDS IS OUR AUCTION-BASED ADVERTISING PROGRAM THAT ENABLES ADVERTISERS TO PLACE TEXT-BASED AND DISPLAY ADS ON OUR WEBSITES\nAND OUR GOOGLE NETWORK MEMBERS\u0092 WEBSITES. DISPLAY ADVERTISING COMPRISES THE VIDEOS, TEXT, IMAGES, AND OTHER INTERACTIVE ADS THAT RUN ACROSS THE WEB ON COMPUTERS AND MOBILE DEVICES, INCLUDING SMART PHONES AND HANDHELD COMPUTERS SUCH AS NETBOOKS\nAND TABLETS. MOST OF OUR ADWORDS CUSTOMERS PAY US ON A COST-PER-CLICK BASIS, WHICH MEANS THAT AN ADVERTISER PAYS US ONLY WHEN A USER CLICKS ON ONE OF ITS ADS. WE ALSO OFFER ADWORDS ON A COST-PER-IMPRESSION BASIS THAT ENABLES ADVERTISERS TO PAY US\nBASED ON THE NUMBER OF TIMES THEIR ADS APPEAR ON OUR WEBSITES AND OUR GOOGLE NETWORK MEMBERS\u0092 WEBSITES AS SPECIFIED BY THE ADVERTISERS. FOR ADVERTISERS USING OUR ADWORDS COST-PER-CLICK PRICING, WE RECOGNIZE AS REVENUE THE FEES CHARGED TO\nADVERTISERS\n26\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nEACH TIME A USER CLICKS ON ONE OF THE ADS THAT APPEARS NEXT TO THE SEARCH RESULTS OR CONTENT ON OUR WEBSITES OR OUR GOOGLE NETWORK MEMBERS\u0092 WEBSITES. FOR ADVERTISERS USING OUR ADWORDS\nCOST-PER-IMPRESSION PRICING, WE RECOGNIZE AS REVENUE THE FEES CHARGED TO ADVERTISERS EACH TIME THEIR ADS ARE DISPLAYED ON OUR WEBSITES OR OUR GOOGLE NETWORK MEMBERS\u0092 WEBSITES. OUR ADWORDS AGREEMENTS ARE GENERALLY TERMINABLE AT ANY TIME BY OUR\nADVERTISERS.\nGOOGLE ADSENSE REFERS TO THE ONLINE PROGRAMS THROUGH WHICH WE DISTRIBUTE OUR ADVERTISERS\u0092 ADWORDS ADS FOR DISPLAY ON\nOUR GOOGLE NETWORK MEMBERS\u0092 WEBSITES, AS WELL AS PROGRAMS TO DELIVER ADS ON TELEVISION BROADCASTS. OUR ADSENSE PROGRAMS INCLUDE ADSENSE FOR SEARCH AND ADSENSE FOR CONTENT.\nADSENSE FOR SEARCH IS OUR ONLINE SERVICE FOR DISTRIBUTING RELEVANT ADS FROM OUR ADVERTISERS FOR DISPLAY WITH SEARCH RESULTS ON OUR GOOGLE NETWORK\nMEMBERS\u0092 WEBSITES. TO USE ADSENSE FOR SEARCH, MOST OF OUR ADSENSE FOR SEARCH PARTNERS ADD GOOGLE SEARCH FUNCTIONALITY TO THEIR WEB PAGES IN THE FORM OF CUSTOMIZABLE GOOGLE SEARCH BOXES. WHEN VISITORS TO THESE WEBSITES SEARCH EITHER THE WEBSITE\nOR THE INTERNET USING THESE CUSTOMIZABLE SEARCH BOXES, WE DISPLAY RELEVANT ADS ON THE SEARCH RESULTS PAGES, TARGETED TO MATCH USER SEARCH QUERIES. ADS SHOWN THROUGH ADSENSE FOR SEARCH ARE TEXT ADS.\nADSENSE FOR CONTENT IS OUR ONLINE SERVICE FOR DISTRIBUTING ADS FROM OUR ADVERTISERS THAT ARE RELEVANT TO CONTENT ON OUR GOOGLE NETWORK\nMEMBERS\u0092 WEBSITES. UNDER THIS PROGRAM, WE USE AUTOMATED TECHNOLOGY TO ANALYZE THE MEANING OF THE CONTENT ON THE WEB PAGE AND SERVE RELEVANT ADS BASED ON THE MEANING OF SUCH CONTENT. FOR EXAMPLE, A WEB PAGE ON AN AUTOMOTIVE BLOG THAT CONTAINS AN\nENTRY ABOUT VINTAGE CARS MIGHT DISPLAY ADS FOR VINTAGE CAR PARTS OR VINTAGE CAR SHOWS. THESE ADS ARE DISPLAYED IN SPACES THAT OUR ADSENSE FOR CONTENT PARTNERS HAVE SET ASIDE ON THEIR WEBSITES. ADSENSE FOR CONTENT ALLOWS A VARIETY OF AD TYPES TO BE\nSHOWN, INCLUDING TEXT ADS, IMAGE ADS, GOOGLE VIDEO ADS, LINK UNITS (WHICH ARE SETS OF CLICKABLE LINKS TO TOPIC PAGES RELATED TO PAGE CONTENT), THEMED UNITS (WHICH ARE REGULAR TEXT ADS WITH GRAPHIC TREATMENTS THAT CHANGE SEASONALLY AND BY GEOGRAPHY),\nAND GADGET ADS (WHICH ARE CUSTOMIZED \u0093MINI-SITES\u0094 THAT RUN AS ADS ON ADSENSE PUBLISHER WEBSITES).\nFOR OUR ONLINE ADSENSE\nPROGRAM, OUR ADVERTISERS PAY US A FEE EACH TIME A USER CLICKS ON ONE OF OUR ADVERTISERS\u0092 ADS DISPLAYED ON OUR GOOGLE NETWORK MEMBERS\u0092 WEBSITES OR, FOR THOSE ADVERTISERS WHO CHOOSE OUR COST-PER-IMPRESSION PRICING, AS THEIR ADS ARE\nDISPLAYED. TO DATE, WE HAVE PAID MOST OF THESE ADVERTISER FEES TO OUR GOOGLE NETWORK MEMBERS, AND WE EXPECT TO CONTINUE DOING SO FOR THE FORESEEABLE FUTURE. WE RECOGNIZE THESE ADVERTISER FEES AS REVENUE AND THE PORTION OF THE ADVERTISER FEE WE PAY\nTO OUR GOOGLE NETWORK MEMBERS AS TRAFFIC ACQUISITION COSTS UNDER COST OF REVENUES. GOOGLE NETWORK MEMBERS DO NOT PAY ANY FEES ASSOCIATED WITH THE USE OF OUR ADSENSE PROGRAM ON THEIR WEBSITES.\nOUR AGREEMENTS WITH GOOGLE NETWORK MEMBERS CONSIST LARGELY OF UNIFORM ONLINE \u0093CLICK-WRAP\u0094 AGREEMENTS THAT MEMBERS ENTER INTO BY\nINTERACTING WITH OUR REGISTRATION WEBSITES. THE STANDARD AGREEMENTS HAVE NO STATED TERM AND ARE TERMINABLE AT WILL. AGREEMENTS WITH OUR LARGER MEMBERS ARE INDIVIDUALLY NEGOTIATED. BOTH THE STANDARD AGREEMENTS AND THE NEGOTIATED AGREEMENTS REQUIRE US\nTO SHARE WITH THE GOOGLE NETWORK MEMBER MOST OF THE ADVERTISER FEES GENERATED BY USERS CLICKING ON ADS ON THE GOOGLE NETWORK MEMBER\u0092S WEBSITE OR, FOR ADVERTISERS WHO CHOOSE OUR COST-PER-IMPRESSION PRICING, AS THE ADS ARE DISPLAYED ON THE GOOGLE\nNETWORK MEMBER\u0092S WEBSITE. FOR EXAMPLE, UNDER OUR STANDARD AGREEMENTS, WE PAY 51% AND 68% OF THE FEES COLLECTED FROM ADVERTISERS TO OUR GOOGLE NETWORK MEMBERS IN ADSENSE FOR SEARCH AND ADSENSE FOR CONTENT, RESPECTIVELY.\nWE ALSO OFFER DISPLAY ADVERTISING MANAGEMENT SERVICES SUCH AS MEDIA PLANNING, BUYING, IMPLEMENTATION, AND MEASUREMENT TOOLS FOR ADVERTISERS AND\nAGENCIES, AND FORECASTING AND REPORTING TOOLS FOR PUBLISHERS. WE RECOGNIZE THE RELATED FEES AS OTHER REVENUES IN THE PERIOD ADVERTISING IMPRESSIONS ARE DELIVERED.\nIN JANUARY 2010, WE LAUNCHED, AND IN JULY 2010, WE DISCONTINUED, OUR DIRECT-TO-CONSUMER WEB STORE CHANNEL FOR DISTRIBUTING OUR NEXUS ONE MOBILE PHONE. WE HAD RECOGNIZED FEES DERIVED FROM THE SALE OF THESE PHONES AS\nOTHER REVENUES IN THE PERIOD IN WHICH THEY WERE DELIVERED.\nWE HAVE ENTERED INTO ARRANGEMENTS WITH CERTAIN CONTENT PROVIDERS UNDER WHICH\nWE DISTRIBUTE OR LICENSE THEIR VIDEO AND OTHER CONTENT. OUR AGREEMENTS WITH CONTENT PROVIDERS ARE TYPICALLY STANDARD AGREEMENTS WITH NO STATED\n27\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nTERM AND ARE TERMINABLE AT WILL. AGREEMENTS WITH OUR LARGER MEMBERS ARE INDIVIDUALLY NEGOTIATED. BOTH THE STANDARD AGREEMENTS AND THE NEGOTIATED AGREEMENTS REQUIRE US TO PAY THE CONTENT PROVIDERS\nFOR THE CONTENT WE LICENSE. IN A NUMBER OF THESE ARRANGEMENTS, WE DISPLAY ADS ON THE PAGES OF OUR WEBSITES FROM WHICH THE CONTENT IS VIEWED AND SHARE MOST OF THE FEES THESE ADS GENERATE WITH THE CONTENT PROVIDERS. WE RECOGNIZE THESE ADVERTISER FEES\nAS REVENUE AND THE FEES WE PAY TO OUR CONTENT PROVIDERS AS CONTENT ACQUISITION COSTS UNDER COST OF REVENUES.\nWE BELIEVE THE FACTORS\nTHAT INFLUENCE THE SUCCESS OF OUR ADVERTISING PROGRAMS INCLUDE THE FOLLOWING.\n\u0095\nTHE RELEVANCE, OBJECTIVITY, AND QUALITY OF OUR SEARCH RESULTS AND THE RELEVANCE AND QUALITY OF ADS DISPLAYED WITH EACH SEARCH RESULTS PAGE.\n\u0095\nTHE NUMBER OF SEARCHES INITIATED AT OUR WEBSITES AND OUR GOOGLE NETWORK MEMBERS\u0092 WEBSITES AND THE UNDERLYING PURPOSE OF THESE SEARCHES (FOR INSTANCE,\nWHETHER THEY ARE FOR ACADEMIC RESEARCH, TO FIND A NEWS ARTICLE, OR TO FIND A PRODUCT OR SERVICE).\n\u0095\nTHE NUMBER AND PROMINENCE OF ADS DISPLAYED ON OUR WEBSITES AND OUR GOOGLE NETWORK MEMBERS\u0092 WEBSITES.\n\u0095\nTHE NUMBER OF VISITS TO, AND THE CONTENT OF, OUR GOOGLE NETWORK MEMBERS\u0092 WEBSITES AND CERTAIN OF OUR WEBSITES AND THE RELEVANCE AND QUALITY OF THE ADS WE\nDISPLAY NEXT TO THIS CONTENT.\n\u0095\nTHE ADVERTISERS\u0092 RETURN ON INVESTMENT FROM ADVERTISING CAMPAIGNS ON OUR WEBSITES OR OUR GOOGLE NETWORK MEMBERS\u0092 WEBSITES COMPARED TO OTHER FORMS OF\nADVERTISING.\n\u0095\nTHE TOTAL ADVERTISING SPENDING BUDGETS OF EACH ADVERTISER.\n\u0095\nTHE NUMBER OF ADVERTISERS AND THE BREADTH OF ITEMS ADVERTISED.\n\u0095\nTHE AMOUNT WE ULTIMATELY PAY OUR GOOGLE NETWORK MEMBERS, DISTRIBUTION PARTNERS, AND OUR CONTENT PROVIDERS FOR TRAFFIC, ACCESS POINTS, AND CONTENT, COMPARED TO\nTHE AMOUNT OF REVENUES WE GENERATE.\n\u0095\nOUR ABILITY TO INCREASE TRAFFIC ON OUR WEBSITES AND OUR GOOGLE NETWORK MEMBERS\u0092 WEBSITES VIA NEW AND IMPROVED AD FORMATS INCLUDING THE ONES ON MOBILE\nDEVICES.\nTRENDS IN OUR BUSINESS\nADVERTISING TRANSACTIONS CONTINUE TO SHIFT FROM OFFLINE TO ONLINE AS THE DIGITAL ECONOMY EVOLVES. THIS HAS CONTRIBUTED TO THE RAPID GROWTH OF OUR BUSINESS SINCE INCEPTION, RESULTING IN SUBSTANTIALLY INCREASED\nREVENUES, AND WE EXPECT THAT OUR BUSINESS WILL CONTINUE TO GROW. HOWEVER, OUR REVENUE GROWTH RATE HAS GENERALLY DECLINED OVER TIME, AND IT COULD DO SO IN THE FUTURE AS A RESULT OF A NUMBER OF FACTORS, INCLUDING INCREASING COMPETITION, CHALLENGES IN\nMAINTAINING OUR GROWTH RATE AS OUR REVENUES INCREASE TO HIGHER LEVELS, AND INCREASING MATURITY OF THE ONLINE ADVERTISING MARKET AND OTHER MARKETS IN WHICH WE PARTICIPATE. IN ADDITION, IF THERE IS A FURTHER GENERAL ECONOMIC DOWNTURN, THIS MAY RESULT\nIN FEWER COMMERCIAL QUERIES BY OUR USERS AND MAY CAUSE ADVERTISERS TO REDUCE THE AMOUNT THEY SPEND ON ONLINE ADVERTISING, INCLUDING THE AMOUNT THEY ARE WILLING TO PAY FOR EACH CLICK OR IMPRESSION, WHICH COULD NEGATIVELY AFFECT THE GROWTH RATE OF OUR\nREVENUES. WE PLAN TO CONTINUE TO INVEST AGGRESSIVELY IN OUR CORE AREAS OF STRATEGIC FOCUS.\nTHE MAIN FOCUS OF OUR ADVERTISING PROGRAMS\nIS TO PROVIDE RELEVANT AND USEFUL ADVERTISING TO OUR USERS, REFLECTING OUR COMMITMENT TO CONSTANTLY IMPROVE THEIR OVERALL WEB EXPERIENCE. AS A RESULT, WE EXPECT TO CONTINUE TO TAKE STEPS TO IMPROVE THE RELEVANCE OF THE ADS DISPLAYED ON OUR WEBSITES\nAND OUR GOOGLE NETWORK MEMBERS\u0092 WEBSITES. THESE STEPS INCLUDE NOT DISPLAYING ADS THAT GENERATE LOW CLICK-THROUGH RATES OR THAT SEND USERS TO IRRELEVANT OR OTHERWISE LOW QUALITY WEBSITES AND TERMINATING OUR RELATIONSHIPS WITH THOSE GOOGLE\nNETWORK MEMBERS WHOSE WEBSITES DO NOT MEET OUR QUALITY REQUIREMENTS. WE MAY ALSO CONTINUE TO TAKE STEPS TO REDUCE THE NUMBER OF ACCIDENTAL CLICKS BY OUR USERS. THESE STEPS COULD NEGATIVELY AFFECT THE GROWTH RATE OF OUR REVENUES.\nBOTH SEASONAL FLUCTUATIONS IN INTERNET USAGE AND TRADITIONAL RETAIL SEASONALITY HAVE AFFECTED, AND ARE LIKELY TO CONTINUE TO AFFECT, OUR BUSINESS.\nINTERNET USAGE GENERALLY SLOWS DURING THE SUMMER MONTHS, AND COMMERCIAL\n28\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nQUERIES TYPICALLY INCREASE SIGNIFICANTLY IN THE FOURTH QUARTER OF EACH YEAR. THESE SEASONAL TRENDS HAVE CAUSED, AND WILL LIKELY CONTINUE TO CAUSE, FLUCTUATIONS IN OUR QUARTERLY RESULTS, INCLUDING\nFLUCTUATIONS IN SEQUENTIAL REVENUES, AS WELL AS AGGREGATE PAID CLICK AND AVERAGE COST-PER-CLICK GROWTH RATES.\nTHE OPERATING MARGIN WE\nREALIZE ON REVENUES GENERATED FROM ADS PLACED ON OUR GOOGLE NETWORK MEMBERS\u0092 WEBSITES THROUGH OUR ADSENSE PROGRAM IS SIGNIFICANTLY LOWER THAN THE OPERATING MARGIN WE REALIZE FROM REVENUES GENERATED FROM ADS PLACED ON OUR WEBSITES BECAUSE MOST\nOF THE ADVERTISER FEES FROM ADS SERVED ON GOOGLE NETWORK MEMBERS\u0092 WEBSITES ARE SHARED WITH OUR GOOGLE NETWORK MEMBERS. FOR THE PAST FIVE YEARS, GROWTH IN ADVERTISING REVENUES FROM OUR WEBSITES HAS GENERALLY EXCEEDED THAT FROM OUR GOOGLE NETWORK\nMEMBERS\u0092 WEBSITES. THIS TREND HAS HAD A POSITIVE IMPACT ON OUR OPERATING MARGINS, AND WE EXPECT THAT THIS WILL CONTINUE FOR THE FORESEEABLE FUTURE, ALTHOUGH THE RELATIVE RATE OF GROWTH IN REVENUES FROM OUR WEBSITES COMPARED TO THE RATE OF\nGROWTH IN REVENUES FROM OUR GOOGLE NETWORK MEMBERS\u0092 WEBSITES MAY VARY OVER TIME.\nWE ALSO CONTINUE TO INVEST AGGRESSIVELY IN OUR\nSYSTEMS, DATA CENTERS, CORPORATE FACILITIES, INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY INFRASTRUCTURE, AND EMPLOYEES. WE INCREASED OUR HIRING IN 2011, AND WE MAY CONTINUE TO DO SO AND TO PROVIDE COMPETITIVE COMPENSATION PROGRAMS FOR OUR EMPLOYEES. FOR INSTANCE,\nEFFECTIVE JANUARY 1, 2011, WE INCREASED BASE SALARIES FOR ALL OF OUR NON-EXECUTIVE EMPLOYEES BY 10% AND SHIFTED A PORTION OF THE BONUS INTO BASE SALARY. OUR FULL-TIME EMPLOYEE HEADCOUNT WAS 24,400 AT DECEMBER 31, 2010 AND 32,467\nAT DECEMBER 31, 2011. ACQUISITIONS WILL ALSO REMAIN AN IMPORTANT COMPONENT OF OUR STRATEGY AND USE OF CAPITAL, AND WE EXPECT OUR CURRENT PACE OF ACQUISITIONS TO CONTINUE. WE EXPECT OUR COST OF REVENUES WILL INCREASE IN DOLLARS AND MAY\nINCREASE AS A PERCENTAGE OF REVENUES IN FUTURE PERIODS, PRIMARILY AS A RESULT OF FORECASTED INCREASES IN TRAFFIC ACQUISITION COSTS, DATA CENTER COSTS, CONTENT ACQUISITION COSTS, CREDIT CARD AND OTHER TRANSACTION FEES, AND OTHER COSTS. IN PARTICULAR,\nTRAFFIC ACQUISITION COSTS AS A PERCENTAGE OF ADVERTISING REVENUES MAY INCREASE IN THE FUTURE IF WE ARE UNABLE TO CONTINUE TO IMPROVE THE MONETIZATION OR GENERATION OF REVENUES FROM TRAFFIC ON OUR WEBSITES AND OUR GOOGLE NETWORK MEMBERS\u0092\nWEBSITES.\nAS WE EXPAND OUR ADVERTISING PROGRAMS AND OTHER PRODUCTS TO INTERNATIONAL MARKETS, WE CONTINUE TO INCREASE OUR EXPOSURE TO\nFLUCTUATIONS IN FOREIGN CURRENCY TO U.S. DOLLAR EXCHANGE RATES. WE HAVE A FOREIGN EXCHANGE RISK MANAGEMENT PROGRAM THAT IS DESIGNED TO REDUCE OUR EXPOSURE TO FLUCTUATIONS IN FOREIGN CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATES. HOWEVER, THIS PROGRAM WILL NOT FULLY\nOFFSET THE EFFECT OF FLUCTUATIONS ON OUR REVENUES AND EARNINGS.\nRESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nTHE FOLLOWING TABLE PRESENTS OUR HISTORICAL OPERATING RESULTS AS A PERCENTAGE OF REVENUES FOR THE PERIODS INDICATED.\nYEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31,\n2009\n2010\n2011\nCONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF INCOME DATA.\nREVENUES\n100.0%\n100.0%\n100.0%\nCOSTS AND EXPENSES.\nCOST OF REVENUES\n37.4\n35.5\n34.8\nRESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT\n12.0\n12.8\n13.6\nSALES AND MARKETING\n8.4\n9.5\n12.1\nGENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE\n7.0\n6.8\n7.2\nCHARGE RELATED TO THE RESOLUTION OF DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE INVESTIGATION\n0\n0\n1.3\nTOTAL COSTS AND EXPENSES\n64.8\n64.6\n69.0\nINCOME FROM OPERATIONS\n35.2\n35.4\n31.0\nINTEREST AND OTHER INCOME, NET\n0.3\n1.4\n1.5\nINCOME BEFORE INCOME TAXES\n35.5\n36.8\n32.5\nPROVISION FOR INCOME TAXES\n7.9\n7.8\n6.8\nNET INCOME\n27.6%\n29.0%\n25.7%\n29\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nREVENUES\nTHE FOLLOWING TABLE PRESENTS OUR REVENUES, BY REVENUE SOURCE, FOR THE PERIODS PRESENTED (IN MILLIONS).\nYEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31,\n2009\n2010\n2011\nADVERTISING REVENUES.\nGOOGLE WEBSITES\n$15,723\n$19,444\n$26,145\nGOOGLE NETWORK MEMBERS\u0092 WEBSITES\n7,166\n8,792\n10,386\nTOTAL ADVERTISING REVENUES\n22,889\n28,236\n36,531\nOTHER REVENUES\n762\n1,085\n1,374\nREVENUES\n$23,651\n$29,321\n$37,905\nTHE FOLLOWING TABLE PRESENTS OUR REVENUES, BY REVENUE SOURCE, AS A PERCENTAGE OF TOTAL REVENUES FOR THE PERIODS\nPRESENTED.\nYEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31,\n2009\n2010\n2011\nADVERTISING REVENUES.\nGOOGLE WEBSITES\n67%\n66%\n69%\nGOOGLE NETWORK MEMBERS\u0092 WEBSITES\n30\n30\n27\nTOTAL ADVERTISING REVENUES\n97\n96\n96\nGOOGLE WEBSITES AS % OF ADVERTISING REVENUES\n69\n69\n72\nGOOGLE NETWORK MEMBERS\u0092 WEBSITES AS % OF ADVERTISING REVENUES\n31\n31\n28\nOTHER REVENUES\n3%\n4%\n4%\nTHE INCREASE IN OUR REVENUES FROM 2010 TO 2011 RESULTED PRIMARILY FROM AN INCREASE IN ADVERTISING REVENUES\nGENERATED BY GOOGLE WEBSITES AND GOOGLE NETWORK MEMBERS\u0092 WEBSITES. THE INCREASE IN ADVERTISING REVENUES FOR GOOGLE WEBSITES AND GOOGLE NETWORK MEMBERS\u0092 WEBSITES RESULTED PRIMARILY FROM AN INCREASE IN THE NUMBER OF PAID CLICKS THROUGH OUR\nADVERTISING PROGRAMS AND, TO A LESSER EXTENT, AN INCREASE IN THE AVERAGE COST-PER-CLICK PAID BY OUR ADVERTISERS. THE INCREASE IN THE NUMBER OF PAID CLICKS GENERATED THROUGH OUR ADVERTISING PROGRAMS WAS DUE TO AN INCREASE IN AGGREGATE TRAFFIC,\nCERTAIN MONETIZATION IMPROVEMENTS INCLUDING NEW AD FORMATS, AND THE CONTINUED GLOBAL EXPANSION OF OUR PRODUCTS, AND OUR ADVERTISER AND USER BASE, AS WELL AS AN INCREASE IN THE NUMBER OF GOOGLE NETWORK MEMBERS. THE INCREASE IN THE AVERAGE\nCOST-PER-CLICK PAID BY OUR ADVERTISERS WAS PRIMARILY DRIVEN BY THE INCREASED SPENDING FROM ADVERTISERS AND A GENERAL WEAKENING OF THE U.S DOLLAR COMPARED TO FOREIGN CURRENCIES (PRIMARILY THE EURO, JAPANESE YEN, AND BRITISH POUND), PARTIALLY OFFSET\nBY THE CHANGES IN GEOGRAPHICAL MIX DUE TO TRAFFIC GROWTH IN EMERGING MARKETS, WHERE THE AVERAGE COST-PER-CLICK IS TYPICALLY LOWER, COMPARED TO MORE MATURE MARKETS. IN ADDITION, THE INCREASE IN ADVERTISING REVENUES FOR GOOGLE NETWORK MEMBERS\u0092\nWEBSITES FROM 2010 TO 2011 WAS PARTIALLY OFFSET BY THE LOSS OF A SEARCH PARTNERSHIP AND, TO A LESSER EXTENT, BY A SEARCH QUALITY IMPROVEMENT MADE DURING THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2011.\nTHE INCREASE IN OUR REVENUES FROM 2009 TO 2010 RESULTED PRIMARILY FROM AN INCREASE IN ADVERTISING REVENUES GENERATED BY GOOGLE WEBSITES AND GOOGLE\nNETWORK MEMBERS\u0092 WEBSITES AND, TO A LESSER EXTENT, AN INCREASE IN OTHER REVENUES, LARGELY AS A RESULT OF THE LAUNCH OF OUR MOBILE PHONE BUSINESS IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2010. THE INCREASE IN ADVERTISING REVENUE FOR GOOGLE WEBSITES AND GOOGLE\nNETWORK MEMBERS\u0092 WEBSITES FROM 2009 TO 2010 RESULTED PRIMARILY FROM AN INCREASE IN THE NUMBER OF PAID CLICKS THROUGH OUR ADVERTISING PROGRAMS AND, TO A LESSER EXTENT, AN INCREASE IN THE AVERAGE COST-PER-CLICK PAID BY OUR ADVERTISERS. THE\nINCREASE IN THE NUMBER OF PAID CLICKS GENERATED THROUGH OUR ADVERTISING PROGRAMS WAS DUE TO AN INCREASE IN AGGREGATE TRAFFIC, CERTAIN MONETIZATION IMPROVEMENTS, INCLUDING NEW AD FORMATS, AND THE CONTINUED GLOBAL EXPANSION OF OUR PRODUCTS, AND OUR\nADVERTISER AND USER BASE, AS WELL AS AN INCREASE IN THE NUMBER OF GOOGLE NETWORK MEMBERS. THE INCREASE IN THE AVERAGE COST-PER-CLICK PAID BY OUR ADVERTISERS WAS PRIMARILY DRIVEN BY THE INCREASED SPENDING FROM ADVERTISERS, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY THE\nCHANGES IN GEOGRAPHICAL MIX DUE TO TRAFFIC GROWTH IN EMERGING MARKETS, WHERE THE AVERAGE COST-PER-CLICK IS TYPICALLY LOWER, COMPARED TO MORE MATURE MARKETS.\n30\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nIMPROVEMENTS IN OUR ABILITY TO ULTIMATELY MONETIZE INCREASED TRAFFIC PRIMARILY RELATE TO ENHANCING\nTHE END USER EXPERIENCE, INCLUDING PROVIDING END USERS WITH ADS THAT ARE MORE RELEVANT TO THEIR SEARCH QUERIES OR TO THE CONTENT ON THE GOOGLE NETWORK MEMBERS\u0092 WEBSITES THEY VISIT. FOR INSTANCE, THESE IMPROVEMENTS INCLUDE INCREASING SITE\nLINKS TO BE FULL SIZE LINKS WITH THE URL (UNIFORM RESOURCE LOCATOR), MOVING A PORTION OF THE FIRST LINE OF THE AD TO THE HEADING TO BETTER PROMOTE THE CONTENT OF THE AD, PROVIDING AN OPTION TO PREVIEW THE AD, AND MOVING THE AD\u0092S URL\nTO A SEPARATE LINE BELOW THE HEADING FOR GREATER PAGE FORMAT CONSISTENCY.\nAGGREGATE PAID CLICKS ON GOOGLE WEBSITES AND GOOGLE NETWORK\nMEMBERS\u0092 WEBSITES INCREASED APPROXIMATELY 25% FROM 2010 TO 2011 AND APPROXIMATELY 16% FROM 2009 TO 2010. AVERAGE COST-PER-CLICK ON GOOGLE WEBSITES AND GOOGLE NETWORK MEMBERS\u0092 WEBSITES INCREASED APPROXIMATELY 3% FROM 2010 TO 2011 AND 5%\nFROM 2009 TO 2010. THE RATE OF CHANGE IN AGGREGATE PAID CLICKS AND AVERAGE COST-PER-CLICK, AND THEIR CORRELATION WITH THE RATE OF CHANGE IN REVENUES, HAS FLUCTUATED AND MAY FLUCTUATE IN THE FUTURE BECAUSE OF VARIOUS FACTORS, INCLUDING THE REVENUE\nGROWTH RATES ON OUR WEBSITES COMPARED TO THOSE OF OUR GOOGLE NETWORK MEMBERS, ADVERTISER COMPETITION FOR KEYWORDS, CHANGES IN FOREIGN CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATES, SEASONALITY, THE FEES ADVERTISERS ARE WILLING TO PAY BASED ON HOW THEY MANAGE THEIR\nADVERTISING COSTS, CHANGES IN ADVERTISING QUALITY OR FORMATS, AND GENERAL ECONOMIC CONDITIONS. IN ADDITION, TRAFFIC GROWTH IN EMERGING MARKETS COMPARED TO MORE MATURE MARKETS AND ACROSS VARIOUS ADVERTISING VERTICALS AND CHANNELS ALSO CONTRIBUTES TO\nTHESE FLUCTUATIONS. CHANGES IN AGGREGATE PAID CLICKS AND AVERAGE COST-PER-CLICK MAY NOT BE INDICATIVE OF OUR PERFORMANCE OR ADVERTISER EXPERIENCES IN ANY SPECIFIC GEOGRAPHIC MARKET, VERTICAL, OR INDUSTRY.\nWE BELIEVE THAT THE INCREASE IN THE NUMBER OF PAID CLICKS ON GOOGLE WEBSITES AND GOOGLE NETWORK MEMBERS\u0092 WEBSITES IS SUBSTANTIALLY THE RESULT\nOF OUR COMMITMENT TO IMPROVING THE RELEVANCE AND QUALITY OF BOTH OUR SEARCH RESULTS AND THE ADVERTISEMENTS DISPLAYED, WHICH WE BELIEVE RESULTS IN A BETTER USER EXPERIENCE, WHICH IN TURN RESULTS IN MORE SEARCHES, ADVERTISERS, AND GOOGLE NETWORK\nMEMBERS AND OTHER PARTNERS.\nREVENUES BY GEOGRAPHY\nTHE FOLLOWING TABLE PRESENTS OUR DOMESTIC AND INTERNATIONAL REVENUES AS A PERCENTAGE OF CONSOLIDATED REVENUES, DETERMINED BASED ON THE BILLING ADDRESSES OF OUR CUSTOMERS.\nYEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31,\n2009\n2010\n2011\nUNITED STATES\n47%\n48%\n46%\nUNITED KINGDOM\n13%\n11%\n11%\nREST OF THE WORLD\n40%\n41%\n43%\nTHE GROWTH IN INTERNATIONAL REVENUES (OTHER THAN THE UNITED KINGDOM) AS A PERCENTAGE OF CONSOLIDATED REVENUES FROM\n2010 TO 2011 RESULTED LARGELY FROM INCREASED ACCEPTANCE OF OUR ADVERTISING PROGRAMS, OUR CONTINUED PROGRESS IN DEVELOPING LOCALIZED VERSIONS OF OUR PRODUCTS FOR THESE INTERNATIONAL MARKETS, AND, TO A LESSER EXTENT, A GENERAL WEAKENING OF THE U.S\nDOLLAR COMPARED TO FOREIGN CURRENCIES (PRIMARILY THE EURO AND JAPANESE YEN).\nTHE GROWTH IN INTERNATIONAL REVENUES (OTHER THAN THE\nUNITED KINGDOM) AS A PERCENTAGE OF CONSOLIDATED REVENUES FROM 2009 TO 2010 RESULTED LARGELY FROM INCREASED ACCEPTANCE OF OUR ADVERTISING PROGRAMS AND OUR CONTINUED PROGRESS IN DEVELOPING LOCALIZED VERSIONS OF OUR PRODUCTS FOR THESE INTERNATIONAL\nMARKETS. THE GROWTH IN REVENUES FROM THE UNITED STATES AS A PERCENTAGE OF CONSOLIDATED REVENUES FROM 2009 TO 2010 RESULTED LARGELY FROM THE RECOVERY OF CERTAIN KEY VERTICALS SUCH AS RETAIL, TRAVEL, FINANCE, AND INSURANCE. THE DECLINE IN REVENUES\nFROM THE UNITED KINGDOM AS A PERCENTAGE OF CONSOLIDATED REVENUES FROM 2009 TO 2010 RESULTED PRIMARILY FROM A LESS ROBUST ECONOMIC RECOVERY RELATIVE TO THE UNITED STATES AND THE REST OF THE WORLD, AS WELL AS A DECREASE IN HEDGING GAINS RECOGNIZED\nDURING 2010.\nTHE GENERAL WEAKENING OF THE U.S. DOLLAR RELATIVE TO CERTAIN FOREIGN CURRENCIES (PRIMARILY THE EURO, JAPANESE YEN, AND\nBRITISH POUND) FROM 2010 TO 2011 HAD A FAVORABLE IMPACT ON OUR INTERNATIONAL REVENUES. HAD FOREIGN\n31\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nEXCHANGE RATES REMAINED CONSTANT IN THESE PERIODS, OUR REVENUES FROM THE UNITED KINGDOM WOULD HAVE BEEN $129 MILLION, OR 3.2%, LOWER AND OUR REVENUES FROM THE REST OF THE WORLD WOULD HAVE BEEN\nAPPROXIMATELY $834 MILLION, OR 5.1%, LOWER IN 2011. THIS IS BEFORE CONSIDERATION OF HEDGING GAINS OF $9 MILLION AND $34 MILLION RECOGNIZED TO REVENUES FROM THE UNITED KINGDOM AND THE REST OF THE WORLD IN 2011.\nTHE GENERAL STRENGTHENING OF THE U.S. DOLLAR RELATIVE TO CERTAIN FOREIGN CURRENCIES (PRIMARILY THE EURO) FROM 2009 TO 2010 HAD AN UNFAVORABLE\nIMPACT ON OUR INTERNATIONAL REVENUES. HAD FOREIGN EXCHANGE RATES REMAINED CONSTANT IN THESE PERIODS, OUR REVENUES FROM THE UNITED KINGDOM WOULD HAVE BEEN APPROXIMATELY $10 MILLION, OR 0.3% HIGHER, AND OUR REVENUES FROM THE REST OF THE WORLD WOULD\nHAVE BEEN APPROXIMATELY $25 MILLION, OR 0.2% HIGHER IN 2010. THIS IS BEFORE CONSIDERATION OF HEDGING GAINS OF $42 MILLION AND $161 MILLION RECOGNIZED TO REVENUES FROM THE UNITED KINGDOM AND THE REST OF THE WORLD IN 2010.\nALTHOUGH WE EXPECT TO CONTINUE TO MAKE INVESTMENTS IN INTERNATIONAL MARKETS, THESE INVESTMENTS MAY NOT RESULT IN AN INCREASE IN OUR INTERNATIONAL\nREVENUES AS A PERCENTAGE OF TOTAL REVENUES IN 2012 OR THEREAFTER. SEE NOTE 16 OF NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS INCLUDED IN ITEM 8 OF THIS ANNUAL REPORT ON FORM 10-K FOR ADDITIONAL INFORMATION ABOUT GEOGRAPHIC AREAS.\nCOSTS AND EXPENSES\nCOST OF REVENUES\nCOST OF REVENUES CONSISTS PRIMARILY OF TRAFFIC ACQUISITION COSTS. TRAFFIC ACQUISITION COSTS CONSIST OF AMOUNTS ULTIMATELY PAID TO\nOUR GOOGLE NETWORK MEMBERS UNDER ADSENSE ARRANGEMENTS AND TO CERTAIN OTHER PARTNERS (OUR DISTRIBUTION PARTNERS) WHO DISTRIBUTE OUR TOOLBAR AND OTHER PRODUCTS (COLLECTIVELY REFERRED TO AS ACCESS POINTS) OR OTHERWISE DIRECT SEARCH QUERIES TO OUR\nWEBSITE (COLLECTIVELY REFERRED TO AS DISTRIBUTION ARRANGEMENTS). THESE AMOUNTS ARE PRIMARILY BASED ON THE REVENUE SHARE AND FIXED FEE ARRANGEMENTS WITH OUR GOOGLE NETWORK MEMBERS AND DISTRIBUTION PARTNERS.\nCERTAIN DISTRIBUTION ARRANGEMENTS REQUIRE US TO PAY OUR PARTNERS BASED ON A FEE PER ACCESS POINT DELIVERED AND NOT EXCLUSIVELY\u0097OR AT\nALL\u0097BASED ON REVENUE SHARE. THESE FEES ARE NON-REFUNDABLE. FURTHER, THESE ARRANGEMENTS ARE TERMINABLE AT WILL, ALTHOUGH UNDER THE TERMS OF CERTAIN CONTRACTS WE OR OUR DISTRIBUTION PARTNERS MAY BE SUBJECT TO PENALTIES IN THE EVENT OF EARLY\nTERMINATION. WE RECOGNIZE FEES UNDER THESE ARRANGEMENTS OVER THE ESTIMATED USEFUL LIVES OF THE ACCESS POINTS (APPROXIMATELY TWO YEARS) TO THE EXTENT WE CAN REASONABLY ESTIMATE THOSE LIVES AND THEY ARE LONGER THAN ONE YEAR, OR BASED ON ANY\nCONTRACTUAL REVENUE SHARE, IF GREATER. OTHERWISE, THE FEES ARE CHARGED TO EXPENSE AS INCURRED. THE ESTIMATED USEFUL LIFE OF THE ACCESS POINTS IS BASED ON THE HISTORICAL AVERAGE PERIOD OF TIME THEY GENERATE TRAFFIC AND REVENUES.\nCOST OF REVENUES ALSO INCLUDES THE EXPENSES ASSOCIATED WITH THE OPERATION OF OUR DATA CENTERS, INCLUDING DEPRECIATION, LABOR, ENERGY, AND BANDWIDTH\nCOSTS, CREDIT CARD AND OTHER TRANSACTION FEES RELATED TO PROCESSING CUSTOMER TRANSACTIONS INCLUDING GOOGLE CHECKOUT TRANSACTIONS, AMORTIZATION OF ACQUIRED INTANGIBLE ASSETS, AS WELL AS CONTENT ACQUISITION COSTS.

HOWEVER, OUR INTENT IS TO PERMANENTLY REINVEST THESE FUNDS OUTSIDE OF THE U.S. AND OUR CURRENT PLANS\nDO NOT DEMONSTRATE A NEED TO REPATRIATE THEM TO FUND OUR U.S. OPERATIONS.\nOUR PRINCIPAL SOURCES OF LIQUIDITY ARE OUR CASH, CASH\nEQUIVALENTS, AND MARKETABLE SECURITIES, AS WELL AS THE CASH FLOW THAT WE GENERATE FROM OUR OPERATIONS.

WE BELIEVE THAT OUR SOURCES OF FUNDING WILL BE\nSUFFICIENT TO SATISFY OUR CURRENTLY ANTICIPATED CASH REQUIREMENTS THROUGH AT LEAST THE NEXT 12 MONTHS.

IN ADDITION, WE MAY MAKE ACQUISITIONS OR LICENSE\nPRODUCTS AND TECHNOLOGIES COMPLEMENTARY TO OUR BUSINESS AND MAY NEED TO RAISE ADDITIONAL CAPITAL THROUGH FUTURE DEBT OR EQUITY FINANCING TO PROVIDE FOR GREATER FLEXIBILITY TO FUND ANY SUCH ACQUISITIONS AND LICENSING ACTIVITIES.

AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2011, THE TOTAL CARRYING VALUE AND ESTIMATED FAIR VALUE OF THESE NOTES WERE $3.0 BILLION AND $3.2 BILLION. THE ESTIMATED FAIR VALUE WAS BASED ON QUOTED PRICES FOR OUR PUBLICLY-TRADED\nDEBT AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2011. WE ARE NOT SUBJECT TO ANY FINANCIAL COVENANTS UNDER THE NOTES. DURING 2011, WE PAID $35 MILLION IN INTEREST PAYMENTS RELATED TO THESE NOTES.\nIN AUGUST 2011, WE ENTERED INTO A MERGER AGREEMENT WITH MOTOROLA, A PROVIDER OF INNOVATIVE TECHNOLOGIES, PRODUCTS AND SERVICES THAT ENABLE A RANGE OF MOBILE AND WIRELINE DIGITAL COMMUNICATION, INFORMATION AND\nENTERTAINMENT EXPERIENCES, UNDER WHICH WE WILL ACQUIRE MOTOROLA FOR $40 PER SHARE IN CASH, OR A TOTAL OF APPROXIMATELY $12.5 BILLION. THE COMPLETION OF THIS TRANSACTION IS SUBJECT TO CUSTOMARY CLOSING CONDITIONS, INCLUDING THE RECEIPT OF CERTAIN\nREGULATORY APPROVALS.

IN ADDITION, THE DECREASE IN CASH FROM CHANGES IN WORKING CAPITAL ACTIVITIES PRIMARILY CONSISTED OF AN INCREASE OF $1,129 MILLION IN ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE DUE TO THE GROWTH IN\nFEES BILLED TO OUR ADVERTISERS AND AN INCREASE OF $414 MILLION IN PREPAID REVENUE SHARE, EXPENSES AND OTHER ASSETS. THESE INCREASES WERE PARTIALLY OFFSET BY AN INCREASE IN ACCRUED EXPENSES AND OTHER LIABILITIES OF $745 MILLION, AN INCREASE IN\nACCOUNTS PAYABLE OF $272 MILLION, AN INCREASE IN ACCRUED REVENUE SHARE OF $214 MILLION, AN INCREASE IN DEFERRED REVENUE OF $111 MILLION, AND A NET INCREASE IN INCOME TAX PAYABLE AND DEFERRED INCOME TAXES OF $102 MILLION, WHICH INCLUDES THE SAME $94\nMILLION OF EXCESS TAX BENEFITS FROM STOCK-BASED AWARD ACTIVITIES INCLUDED UNDER ADJUSTMENTS FOR NON-CASH ITEMS. THE INCREASE IN ACCRUED EXPENSE AND OTHER LIABILITIES, ACCOUNTS PAYABLE, ACCRUED REVENUE SHARE, AND DEFERRED REVENUES ARE PRIMARILY A\nRESULT OF THE GROWTH IN OUR BUSINESS AND HEADCOUNT. THE INCREASE IN NET INCOME TAXES PAYABLE AND DEFERRED INCOME TAXES WAS PRIMARILY A RESULT OF ADDITIONAL TAX OBLIGATIONS ACCRUED, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY THE RELEASE OF CERTAIN TAX RESERVES AS A RESULT\nOF THE SETTLEMENT OF OUR TAX AUDITS FOR OUR 2005 AND 2006 TAX YEARS.\nCASH PROVIDED BY OPERATING ACTIVITIES IN 2009 WAS $9,316 MILLION,\nAND CONSISTED OF NET INCOME OF $6,520 MILLION, ADJUSTMENTS FOR NON-CASH ITEMS OF $2,310 MILLION, AND CASH PROVIDED BY WORKING CAPITAL AND OTHER ACTIVITIES OF $486 MILLION.

THESE INCREASES WERE PARTIALLY OFFSET BY AN INCREASE OF $504 MILLION IN ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE DUE TO\nTHE GROWTH IN FEES BILLED TO OUR ADVERTISERS. THE INCREASE IN NET INCOME TAXES PAYABLE AND DEFERRED INCOME TAXES WAS PRIMARILY A RESULT OF ADDITIONAL TAX OBLIGATIONS ACCRUED, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY AN INCREASE IN THE AMOUNT OF ESTIMATED INCOME TAXES WE\nPAID DURING THE YEAR. THE INCREASE IN ACCRUED REVENUE SHARE WAS DUE TO THE GROWTH IN OUR ADSENSE AND DISTRIBUTION PROGRAMS AND THE TIMING OF PAYMENTS MADE TO OUR PARTNERS.\nAS WE EXPAND OUR BUSINESS INTERNATIONALLY, WE HAVE OFFERED PAYMENT TERMS TO CERTAIN ADVERTISERS THAT ARE STANDARD IN THEIR LOCALES BUT LONGER THAN TERMS WE WOULD GENERALLY OFFER TO OUR DOMESTIC ADVERTISERS. THIS\nMAY INCREASE OUR WORKING CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS AND MAY HAVE A NEGATIVE EFFECT ON CASH PROVIDED BY OUR OPERATING ACTIVITIES.\nCASH USED IN\nINVESTING ACTIVITIES IN 2011 OF $19,041 MILLION WAS PRIMARILY ATTRIBUTABLE TO NET PURCHASES OF MARKETABLE SECURITIES OF $12,926 MILLION, CAPITAL EXPENDITURES OF $3,438 MILLION RELATED PRINCIPALLY TO OUR FACILITIES, DATA CENTERS, AND RELATED\nEQUIPMENT, AND CASH CONSIDERATION USED IN ACQUISITIONS AND OTHER INVESTMENTS OF $2,328 MILLION, INCLUDING $676 MILLION PAID IN CONNECTION WITH THE ACQUISITION OF ITA.

HOWEVER,\nTHE AMOUNT OF OUR CAPITAL EXPENDITURES HAS FLUCTUATED AND MAY CONTINUE TO FLUCTUATE ON A QUARTERLY BASIS.\nIN ADDITION, WE EXPECT TO\nSPEND A SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT OF CASH ON ACQUISITIONS AND OTHER INVESTMENTS FROM TIME TO TIME. THESE ACQUISITIONS GENERALLY ENHANCE THE BREADTH AND DEPTH OF OUR EXPERTISE IN ENGINEERING AND OTHER FUNCTIONAL AREAS, OUR TECHNOLOGIES, AND OUR PRODUCT\nOFFERINGS.\nCASH PROVIDED BY FINANCING ACTIVITIES IN 2011 OF $807 MILLION WAS PRIMARILY DRIVEN BY NET PROCEEDS OF $726 MILLION OF DEBT\nISSUED AND EXCESS TAX BENEFITS FROM STOCK-BASED AWARD ACTIVITIES OF $86 MILLION.\nCASH PROVIDED BY FINANCING ACTIVITIES IN 2010 OF\n$3,050 MILLION WAS PRIMARILY DRIVEN BY $3,463 MILLION OF NET CASH PROCEEDS FROM THE ISSUANCE OF COMMERCIAL PAPER AND A PROMISSORY NOTE.

WE ARE COMMITTED TO PAY A PORTION OF THE RELATED OPERATING EXPENSES UNDER CERTAIN OF THESE LEASE AGREEMENTS. THESE OPERATING EXPENSES ARE NOT INCLUDED IN THE ABOVE TABLE.

CERTAIN LEASES HAVE ADJUSTMENTS FOR MARKET PROVISIONS.\n42\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nPURCHASE OBLIGATIONS\nPURCHASE OBLIGATIONS REPRESENT NON-CANCELABLE CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS AT DECEMBER 31, 2011. THESE CONTRACTS ARE PRIMARILY RELATED TO DISTRIBUTION ARRANGEMENTS, VIDEO AND OTHER CONTENT LICENSING REVENUE SHARING\nARRANGEMENTS, AS WELL AS DATA CENTER OPERATIONS AND FACILITY BUILD-OUTS. IN ADDITION, WE HAD $2.8 BILLION OF OPEN PURCHASE ORDERS FOR WHICH WE HAVE NOT RECEIVED THE RELATED SERVICES OR GOODS AT DECEMBER 31, 2011.

AT THIS TIME, WE ARE UNABLE TO MAKE A REASONABLY RELIABLE ESTIMATE OF THE TIMING OF PAYMENTS IN INDIVIDUAL YEARS BEYOND 12 MONTHS DUE TO UNCERTAINTIES IN THE TIMING OF TAX AUDIT OUTCOMES. AS A RESULT,\nTHIS AMOUNT IS NOT INCLUDED IN THE ABOVE TABLE.\nOFF-BALANCE SHEET ENTITIES\nAT DECEMBER 31, 2011, WE DID NOT HAVE ANY OFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS, AS DEFINED IN ITEM 303(A)(4)(II) OF REGULATION S-K PROMULGATED BY THE SEC, THAT HAVE OR ARE REASONABLY LIKELY TO HAVE A CURRENT OR\nFUTURE EFFECT ON OUR FINANCIAL CONDITION, CHANGES IN OUR FINANCIAL CONDITION, REVENUES, OR EXPENSES, RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, LIQUIDITY, CAPITAL EXPENDITURES, OR CAPITAL RESOURCES THAT IS MATERIAL TO INVESTORS.\nCRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES\nWE\nPREPARE OUR CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS IN ACCORDANCE WITH ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES GENERALLY ACCEPTED IN THE U.S. (U.S. GAAP). IN DOING SO, WE HAVE TO MAKE ESTIMATES AND ASSUMPTIONS THAT AFFECT OUR REPORTED AMOUNTS OF ASSETS, LIABILITIES,\nREVENUES, AND EXPENSES, AS WELL AS RELATED DISCLOSURE OF CONTINGENT ASSETS AND LIABILITIES. IN SOME CASES, WE COULD REASONABLY HAVE USED DIFFERENT ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES. IN SOME CASES, CHANGES IN THE ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES ARE REASONABLY\nLIKELY TO OCCUR FROM PERIOD TO PERIOD. ACCORDINGLY, ACTUAL RESULTS COULD DIFFER MATERIALLY FROM OUR ESTIMATES. TO THE EXTENT THAT THERE ARE MATERIAL DIFFERENCES BETWEEN THESE ESTIMATES AND ACTUAL RESULTS, OUR FINANCIAL CONDITION OR RESULTS OF\nOPERATIONS WILL BE AFFECTED. WE BASE OUR ESTIMATES ON PAST EXPERIENCE AND OTHER ASSUMPTIONS THAT WE BELIEVE ARE REASONABLE UNDER THE CIRCUMSTANCES, AND WE EVALUATE THESE ESTIMATES ON AN ONGOING BASIS. WE REFER TO ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES OF THIS TYPE AS\nCRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES, WHICH WE DISCUSS FURTHER BELOW. WE HAVE REVIEWED OUR CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES WITH THE AUDIT COMMITTEE OF OUR BOARD OF DIRECTORS.\nINCOME TAXES\nWE ARE SUBJECT\nTO INCOME TAXES IN THE U.S. AND NUMEROUS FOREIGN JURISDICTIONS. SIGNIFICANT JUDGMENT IS REQUIRED IN EVALUATING OUR UNCERTAIN TAX POSITIONS AND DETERMINING OUR PROVISION FOR INCOME TAXES.\n43\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nALTHOUGH WE BELIEVE WE HAVE ADEQUATELY RESERVED FOR OUR UNCERTAIN TAX POSITIONS, NO ASSURANCE CAN BE\nGIVEN THAT THE FINAL TAX OUTCOME OF THESE MATTERS WILL NOT BE DIFFERENT. WE ADJUST THESE RESERVES IN LIGHT OF CHANGING FACTS AND CIRCUMSTANCES, SUCH AS THE CLOSING OF A TAX AUDIT OR THE REFINEMENT OF AN ESTIMATE. TO THE EXTENT THAT THE FINAL TAX\nOUTCOME OF THESE MATTERS IS DIFFERENT THAN THE AMOUNTS RECORDED, SUCH DIFFERENCES WILL IMPACT THE PROVISION FOR INCOME TAXES IN THE PERIOD IN WHICH SUCH DETERMINATION IS MADE. THE PROVISION FOR INCOME TAXES INCLUDES THE IMPACT OF RESERVE PROVISIONS\nAND CHANGES TO RESERVES THAT ARE CONSIDERED APPROPRIATE, AS WELL AS THE RELATED NET INTEREST.\nOUR EFFECTIVE TAX RATES HAVE DIFFERED\nFROM THE STATUTORY RATE PRIMARILY DUE TO THE TAX IMPACT OF FOREIGN OPERATIONS, STATE TAXES, CERTAIN BENEFITS REALIZED RELATED TO STOCK-BASED AWARD ACTIVITIES, AND RESEARCH AND EXPERIMENTATION TAX CREDITS. THE EFFECTIVE TAX RATES WERE 22.2%, 21.2%,\nAND 21.0% FOR 2009, 2010, AND 2011. OUR FUTURE EFFECTIVE TAX RATES COULD BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED BY EARNINGS BEING LOWER THAN ANTICIPATED IN COUNTRIES THAT HAVE LOWER STATUTORY RATES AND HIGHER THAN ANTICIPATED IN COUNTRIES THAT HAVE HIGHER STATUTORY\nRATES, THE NET GAINS AND LOSSES RECOGNIZED BY LEGAL ENTITIES ON CERTAIN HEDGES AND RELATED HEDGED INTERCOMPANY AND OTHER TRANSACTIONS UNDER OUR FOREIGN EXCHANGE RISK MANAGEMENT PROGRAM, CHANGES IN THE VALUATION OF OUR DEFERRED TAX ASSETS OR\nLIABILITIES, OR CHANGES IN TAX LAWS, REGULATIONS, OR ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES, AS WELL AS CERTAIN DISCRETE ITEMS. IN ADDITION, WE ARE SUBJECT TO THE CONTINUOUS EXAMINATION OF OUR INCOME TAX RETURNS BY THE IRS AND OTHER TAX AUTHORITIES. WE REGULARLY\nASSESS THE LIKELIHOOD OF ADVERSE OUTCOMES RESULTING FROM THESE EXAMINATIONS TO DETERMINE THE ADEQUACY OF OUR PROVISION FOR INCOME TAXES.\nLOSS CONTINGENCIES\nWE ARE\nREGULARLY SUBJECT TO CLAIMS, SUITS, GOVERNMENT INVESTIGATIONS, AND OTHER PROCEEDINGS INVOLVING COMPETITION AND ANTITRUST, INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY, PRIVACY, TAX, LABOR AND EMPLOYMENT, COMMERCIAL DISPUTES, CONTENT GENERATED BY OUR USERS, GOODS AND\nSERVICES OFFERED BY ADVERTISERS OR PUBLISHERS USING OUR PLATFORMS, AND OTHER MATTERS. CERTAIN OF THESE MATTERS INCLUDE SPECULATIVE CLAIMS FOR SUBSTANTIAL OR INDETERMINATE AMOUNTS OF DAMAGES. WE RECORD A LIABILITY WHEN WE BELIEVE THAT IT IS BOTH\nPROBABLE THAT A LOSS HAS BEEN INCURRED, AND THE AMOUNT CAN BE REASONABLY ESTIMATED. WE EVALUATE, ON A MONTHLY BASIS, DEVELOPMENTS IN OUR LEGAL MATTERS THAT COULD AFFECT THE AMOUNT OF LIABILITY THAT HAS BEEN PREVIOUSLY ACCRUED, AND MAKE ADJUSTMENTS\nAS APPROPRIATE. SIGNIFICANT JUDGMENT IS REQUIRED TO DETERMINE BOTH LIKELIHOOD OF THERE BEING AND THE ESTIMATED AMOUNT OF A LOSS RELATED TO SUCH MATTERS. UNTIL THE FINAL RESOLUTION OF SUCH MATTERS, THERE MAY BE AN EXPOSURE TO LOSS IN EXCESS OF THE\nAMOUNT RECORDED, AND SUCH AMOUNTS COULD BE MATERIAL. SHOULD ANY OF OUR ESTIMATES AND ASSUMPTIONS CHANGE OR PROVE TO HAVE BEEN INCORRECT, IT COULD HAVE A MATERIAL IMPACT ON OUR BUSINESS, CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL POSITION, RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, OR CASH\nFLOWS. SEE NOTE 12 OF NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS INCLUDED IN ITEM 8 OF THIS ANNUAL REPORT ON FORM 10-K FOR ADDITIONAL INFORMATION REGARDING CONTINGENCIES.\nSTOCK-BASED COMPENSATION\nOUR STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION EXPENSE FOR STOCK OPTIONS IS ESTIMATED AT THE GRANT DATE BASED ON THE AWARD\u0092S FAIR VALUE AS CALCULATED BY THE\nBLACK-SCHOLES-MERTON (BSM) OPTION PRICING MODEL AND IS RECOGNIZED AS EXPENSE OVER THE REQUISITE SERVICE PERIOD. THE BSM MODEL REQUIRES VARIOUS HIGHLY JUDGMENTAL ASSUMPTIONS INCLUDING EXPECTED VOLATILITY AND EXPECTED TERM. IF ANY OF THE ASSUMPTIONS\nUSED IN THE BSM MODEL CHANGES SIGNIFICANTLY, STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION EXPENSE MAY DIFFER MATERIALLY IN THE FUTURE FROM THAT RECORDED IN THE CURRENT PERIOD. IN ADDITION, WE ARE REQUIRED TO ESTIMATE THE EXPECTED FORFEITURE RATE AND ONLY RECOGNIZE\nEXPENSE FOR THOSE SHARES EXPECTED TO VEST. WE ESTIMATE THE FORFEITURE RATE BASED ON HISTORICAL EXPERIENCE AND OUR EXPECTATIONS REGARDING FUTURE PRE-VESTING TERMINATION BEHAVIOR OF EMPLOYEES. TO THE EXTENT OUR ACTUAL FORFEITURE RATE IS DIFFERENT FROM\nOUR ESTIMATE, STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION EXPENSE IS ADJUSTED ACCORDINGLY.\nIMPAIRMENT OF MARKETABLE AND NON-MARKETABLE SECURITIES\nWE PERIODICALLY REVIEW OUR MARKETABLE SECURITIES AND OUR NON-MARKETABLE EQUITY SECURITIES FOR IMPAIRMENT. IF WE CONCLUDE THAT ANY OF\nTHESE INVESTMENTS ARE IMPAIRED, WE DETERMINE WHETHER SUCH IMPAIRMENT IS OTHER-THAN-TEMPORARY. FACTORS WE CONSIDER TO MAKE SUCH DETERMINATION INCLUDE THE DURATION AND SEVERITY OF THE IMPAIRMENT,\n44\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nTHE REASON FOR THE DECLINE IN VALUE, THE POTENTIAL RECOVERY PERIOD, AND OUR INTENT TO SELL, OR WHETHER IT IS MORE LIKELY THAN NOT THAT WE WILL BE REQUIRED TO SELL, THE INVESTMENT BEFORE RECOVERY.\nIF ANY IMPAIRMENT IS CONSIDERED OTHER-THAN-TEMPORARY, WE WILL WRITE DOWN THE ASSET TO ITS FAIR VALUE AND TAKE A CORRESPONDING CHARGE TO OUR CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF INCOME.\nRECENT ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS\nIN JUNE 2011, THE FINANCIAL ACCOUNTING STANDARDS BOARD (FASB)\nISSUED AN AMENDMENT TO AN EXISTING ACCOUNTING STANDARD WHICH REQUIRES COMPANIES TO PRESENT NET INCOME AND OTHER COMPREHENSIVE INCOME IN ONE CONTINUOUS STATEMENT OR IN TWO SEPARATE, BUT CONSECUTIVE, STATEMENTS. IN ADDITION, IN DECEMBER\n2011, THE FASB ISSUED AN AMENDMENT TO AN EXISTING ACCOUNTING STANDARD WHICH DEFERS THE REQUIREMENT TO PRESENT COMPONENTS OF RECLASSIFICATIONS OF OTHER COMPREHENSIVE INCOME ON THE FACE OF THE INCOME STATEMENT. WE ADOPTED BOTH STANDARDS IN THE\nFOURTH QUARTER OF 2011.\nIN SEPTEMBER 2011, THE FASB ISSUED AN AMENDMENT TO AN EXISTING ACCOUNTING STANDARD, WHICH PROVIDES ENTITIES AN\nOPTION TO PERFORM A QUALITATIVE ASSESSMENT TO DETERMINE WHETHER FURTHER IMPAIRMENT TESTING ON GOODWILL IS NECESSARY. SPECIFICALLY, AN ENTITY HAS THE OPTION TO FIRST ASSESS QUALITATIVE FACTORS TO DETERMINE WHETHER IT IS NECESSARY TO\nPERFORM THE CURRENT TWO-STEP TEST. IF AN ENTITY BELIEVES, AS A RESULT OF ITS QUALITATIVE ASSESSMENT, THAT IT IS MORE-LIKELY-THAN-NOT THAT THE FAIR VALUE OF A REPORTING UNIT IS LESS THAN ITS CARRYING AMOUNT, THE QUANTITATIVE IMPAIRMENT\nTEST IS REQUIRED. OTHERWISE, NO FURTHER TESTING IS REQUIRED. THIS STANDARD IS EFFECTIVE FOR ANNUAL AND INTERIM GOODWILL IMPAIRMENT TESTS PERFORMED FOR FISCAL YEARS BEGINNING AFTER DECEMBER 15, 2011. WE ADOPTED THIS STANDARD IN\nTHE FIRST QUARTER OF 2012 AND THE ADOPTION WILL NOT HAVE A MATERIAL IMPACT ON OUR FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.\nIN MAY 2011, THE FASB ISSUED A\nNEW ACCOUNTING STANDARD UPDATE, WHICH AMENDS THE FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENT GUIDANCE AND INCLUDES SOME ENHANCED DISCLOSURE REQUIREMENTS. THE MOST SIGNIFICANT CHANGE IN DISCLOSURES IS AN EXPANSION OF THE INFORMATION REQUIRED FOR LEVEL 3 MEASUREMENTS\nBASED ON UNOBSERVABLE INPUTS. THE STANDARD IS EFFECTIVE FOR FISCAL YEARS BEGINNING AFTER DECEMBER 15, 2011. WE ADOPTED THIS STANDARD IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2012 AND THE ADOPTION WILL NOT HAVE A MATERIAL IMPACT ON OUR FINANCIAL\nSTATEMENTS AND DISCLOSURES.","14355":"ITEM 7.\nMANAGEMENT\u0092S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nFORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS\nIN\nADDITION TO CURRENT AND HISTORICAL INFORMATION, THIS ANNUAL REPORT ON FORM 10-K CONTAINS FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS WITHIN THE MEANING OF THE PRIVATE SECURITIES LITIGATION REFORM ACT OF 1995.

AS PART OF THIS REVIEW, WE HAVE PURSUED A\nWIDE RANGE OF DISCUSSIONS WITH POTENTIAL PARTNERS. WE ARE IN DISCUSSIONS REGARDING THE POSSIBILITY OF RESTRUCTURING OUR HOLDINGS IN ALIBABA GROUP AND YAHOO JAPAN. WHILE WE CONTINUE TO PURSUE THESE DISCUSSIONS, THERE IS NO ASSURANCE THAT ANY\nTRANSACTION WILL BE ACHIEVED.\nSEARCH AGREEMENT WITH MICROSOFT CORPORATION\nON DECEMBER 4, 2009, WE ENTERED INTO A SEARCH AND ADVERTISING SERVICES AND SALES AGREEMENT (THE \u0093SEARCH AGREEMENT\u0094) WITH MICROSOFT CORPORATION (\u0093MICROSOFT\u0094), WHICH PROVIDES FOR\nMICROSOFT TO BE THE EXCLUSIVE ALGORITHMIC AND PAID SEARCH SERVICES PROVIDER ON YAHOO!

PROPERTIES. WE ARE ALSO ENTITLED TO RECEIVE 88 PERCENT OF THE REVENUE GENERATED FROM MICROSOFT\u0092S SERVICES ON AFFILIATE SITES AFTER THE AFFILIATE\u0092S SHARE OF REVENUE. IN THE TRANSITIONED MARKETS, FOR\nSEARCH REVENUE GENERATED FROM MICROSOFT\u0092S SERVICES ON YAHOO!

IN THE FOURTH QUARTER OF 2011, MICROSOFT AGREED TO EXTEND THE RPS GUARANTEE IN THE U.S. AND CANADA THROUGH MARCH 2013. THE\nRPS GUARANTEE IS CALCULATED BASED ON THE DIFFERENCE IN REVENUE PER SEARCH BETWEEN THE PRE-TRANSITION AND POST-TRANSITION PERIODS. WE RECORD THE RPS GUARANTEE AS SEARCH REVENUE IN THE QUARTER THE AMOUNT BECOMES FIXED, WHICH IS TYPICALLY THE QUARTER\nIN WHICH THE ASSOCIATED SHORTFALL IN REVENUE PER SEARCH OCCURRED.\nUNDER THE SEARCH AGREEMENT, MICROSOFT AGREED TO REIMBURSE US FOR CERTAIN\nTRANSITION COSTS UP TO AN AGGREGATE TOTAL OF $150 MILLION DURING THE FIRST THREE YEARS OF THE SEARCH AGREEMENT. DURING THE THIRD QUARTER OF 2011, OUR CUMULATIVE TRANSITION COSTS EXCEEDED MICROSOFT\u0092S $150 MILLION REIMBURSEMENT CAP UNDER THE\nSEARCH AGREEMENT. TRANSITION COSTS WE INCUR IN EXCESS OF THE $150 MILLION REIMBURSEMENT CAP ARE NOT SUBJECT TO REIMBURSEMENT. OUR RESULTS FOR THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2011 REFLECT TRANSITION COST REIMBURSEMENTS FROM MICROSOFT UNDER THE\nSEARCH AGREEMENT OF $26 MILLION.

THE 2009 TRANSITION COST REIMBURSEMENTS WERE RECORDED IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2010 AFTER REGULATORY CLEARANCE IN THE U.S. AND EUROPE WAS RECEIVED, IMPLEMENTATION OF THE SEARCH\nAGREEMENT COMMENCED, AND MICROSOFT BECAME OBLIGATED TO MAKE SUCH PAYMENTS.\nFROM FEBRUARY 23, 2010 UNTIL THE APPLICABLE SERVICES ARE\nFULLY TRANSITIONED TO MICROSOFT IN ALL MARKETS, MICROSOFT WILL ALSO REIMBURSE US FOR THE COSTS OF OPERATING ALGORITHMIC AND PAID SEARCH SERVICES SUBJECT TO SPECIFIED EXCLUSIONS AND LIMITATIONS.

THE DECLINE FOR THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2010 WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO REIMBURSEMENTS RECORDED FROM MICROSOFT FOR\nINFORMATION TECHNOLOGY COSTS, FOR WHICH THERE WERE NO SIMILAR REIMBURSEMENTS IN 2009. FOR THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2010, THE NET IMPACT OF THE REIMBURSEMENTS BY MICROSOFT FOR OUR COST OF RUNNING SEARCH WAS A REDUCTION IN INFORMATION\nTECHNOLOGY EXPENSE OF $95 MILLION COMPARED TO 2009.\nDEPRECIATION AND AMORTIZATION EXPENSES\n. DEPRECIATION AND AMORTIZATION EXPENSES\nDECREASED $31 MILLION FOR THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2011, COMPARED TO 2010. EXCLUDING THE IMPACT OF MICROSOFT REIMBURSEMENTS,\n43\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nDEPRECIATION AND AMORTIZATION EXPENSE DECREASED $34 MILLION FOR YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2011, COMPARED TO 2010. THE DECREASE WAS PRIMARILY DRIVEN BY A DECREASE IN DEPRECIATION AND\nAMORTIZATION EXPENSE FOR FULLY DEPRECIATED OR AMORTIZED ASSETS ACQUIRED IN PRIOR YEARS. THE DECLINE IN DEPRECIATION AND AMORTIZATION EXPENSE WAS OFFSET BY DECREASED MICROSOFT REIMBURSEMENTS OF $4 MILLION DURING THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2011,\nCOMPARED TO 2010.\nDEPRECIATION AND AMORTIZATION EXPENSES DECREASED $82 MILLION FOR THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2010, COMPARED TO 2009.\nEXCLUDING THE IMPACT OF MICROSOFT REIMBURSEMENTS, DEPRECIATION AND AMORTIZATION EXPENSE DECREASED $56 MILLION FOR YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2010, COMPARED TO 2009. THE DECLINE WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO DECREASED AMORTIZATION EXPENSE FOR INTANGIBLE\nASSETS ASSOCIATED WITH DIVESTED BUSINESS LINES AS WELL AS FULLY AMORTIZED INTANGIBLE ASSETS ACQUIRED IN PRIOR YEARS. THE DECREASE IN DEPRECIATION AND AMORTIZATION EXPENSES WAS OFFSET BY INCREASED MICROSOFT REIMBURSEMENTS OF $26 MILLION DURING THE\nYEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2010, FOR WHICH THERE WERE NO SIMILAR REIMBURSEMENTS IN 2009.\nTAC.\nTAC DECREASED $1,133 MILLION AND $41\nMILLION FOR THE YEARS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2011 AND DECEMBER 31, 2010, RESPECTIVELY, COMPARED TO 2010 AND 2009, RESPECTIVELY. THE DECREASE YEAR-OVER-YEAR IN BOTH YEARS IS PRIMARILY DUE TO THE CHANGE IN THE RECORDING OF TAC IN THE FOURTH\nQUARTER OF 2010 DUE TO THE SEARCH AGREEMENT WITH MICROSOFT AS WE NO LONGER INCUR TAC FOR TRANSITIONED MARKETS. WE NOW RECEIVE AN 88 PERCENT REVENUE SHARE IN THE TRANSITIONED MARKETS AS MICROSOFT IS THE PRIMARY OBLIGOR TO THE ADVERTISERS. IN\nADDITION, THE DECREASE IN TAC FOR THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2011, COMPARED TO 2010, WAS DUE TO THE LOSS OF AN AFFILIATE IN THE ASIA PACIFIC REGION DURING LATE 2010. THE DECREASE FOR THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2010, COMPARED TO 2009, WAS\nOFFSET BY INCREASES IN TAC DUE TO A NEW AFFILIATE IN THE ASIA PACIFIC SEGMENT ADDED IN THE FOURTH QUARTER OF 2009 AS WELL AS INCREASES IN REVENUE FROM AFFILIATE SITES.\nFACILITIES AND OTHER EXPENSES\n. FACILITIES AND OTHER EXPENSES DECREASED $117 MILLION YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2011, COMPARED TO 2010. EXCLUDING THE IMPACT OF MICROSOFT REIMBURSEMENTS,\nFACILITIES AND OTHER EXPENSES DECREASED $161 MILLION, PRIMARILY DUE TO DECREASES IN MARKETING-RELATED EXPENSES. MARKETING-RELATED EXPENSES DECREASED DURING THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2011 COMPARED TO 2010 DUE TO THE LAUNCH OF VARIOUS 2010\nMARKETING CAMPAIGNS, INCLUDING OUR GLOBAL BRANDING CAMPAIGN, FOR WHICH THERE WERE NO SIMILAR CAMPAIGNS IN 2011. THE DECLINE IN FACILITIES AND OTHER EXPENSES WAS OFFSET BY DECREASED MICROSOFT REIMBURSEMENTS OF $44 MILLION DURING THE YEAR ENDED\nDECEMBER 31, 2011, COMPARED TO 2010. THE DECREASE IN MICROSOFT REIMBURSEMENTS FOR THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2011 WAS DUE TO THE TRANSITION OF PAID SEARCH TO MICROSOFT PLATFORMS.\nFACILITIES AND OTHER EXPENSES DECREASED $133 MILLION FOR THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2010, COMPARED TO 2009. EXCLUDING THE IMPACT OF MICROSOFT REIMBURSEMENTS, FACILITIES AND OTHER EXPENSES\nDECREASED $61 MILLION. THE DECREASE IS MAINLY DUE TO A REDUCTION IN RESTRUCTURING CHARGES OF $69 MILLION, A REDUCTION IN THIRD-PARTY SERVICE-PROVIDER EXPENSES OF $45 MILLION, AND DECREASES IN LEGAL SETTLEMENTS OF $21 MILLION, OFFSET BY\nINCREASES IN MARKETING EXPENSES OF $33 MILLION. FOR THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2010, WE RECORDED TOTAL COST REIMBURSEMENTS FROM MICROSOFT OF $93 MILLION FOR OTHER COSTS, FOR WHICH THERE WERE NO SIMILAR REIMBURSEMENTS IN 2009. FOR THE YEAR\nENDED DECEMBER 31, 2010, THE NET IMPACT OF THE REIMBURSEMENTS BY MICROSOFT FOR OUR COST OF RUNNING SEARCH AND TRANSITION COSTS INCURRED IN 2009 WAS A REDUCTION IN FACILITIES AND OTHER EXPENSES OF $72 MILLION COMPARED TO 2009. THIRD-PARTY\nSERVICE-PROVIDER EXPENSES DECREASED PRIMARILY DUE TO LOWER ADVISORY AND CONSULTING COSTS. MARKETING-RELATED EXPENSES INCREASED DURING THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2010 COMPARED TO 2009 DUE TO ADDITIONAL 2010 MARKETING CAMPAIGNS INCLUDING OUR\nGLOBAL BRANDING CAMPAIGN.\nWE CURRENTLY EXPECT OUR OPERATING COSTS TO INCREASE FOR THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2012, COMPARED TO THE SAME PERIOD OF\n2011, REFLECTING OUR PLANNED REINVESTMENTS IN THE BUSINESS AND THE INTEGRATION OF INTERCLICK, INC.\n44\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nRESTRUCTURING CHARGES, NET.\nFOR THE YEARS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2009, 2010, AND 2011, RESTRUCTURING\nCHARGES, NET WAS COMPRISED OF THE FOLLOWING (IN THOUSANDS).\nYEARS ENDED DECEMBER 31,\n2009\n2010\n2011\nEMPLOYEE SEVERANCE PAY AND RELATED COSTS\n$48,696\n$39,652\n$12,965\nNON-CANCELABLE LEASE, CONTRACT TERMINATIONS, AND OTHER CHARGES\n59,285\n19,737\n10,251\nOTHER NON-CASH CHARGES\n7,858\n2,779\n990\nSUB-TOTAL BEFORE ACCELERATIONS (REVERSALS) OF STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION EXPENSE\n115,839\n62,168\n24,206\nACCELERATIONS (REVERSALS) OF STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION EXPENSE\n11,062\n(4,211\n)\n214\nRESTRUCTURING CHARGES, NET\n$126,901\n$57,957\n$24,420\nQ408 RESTRUCTURING PLAN.\nDURING THE FOURTH QUARTER OF 2008, WE IMPLEMENTED CERTAIN COST REDUCTION INITIATIVES,\nINCLUDING A WORKFORCE REDUCTION AND CONSOLIDATION OF CERTAIN REAL ESTATE FACILITIES. WE BEGAN TO CONSOLIDATE AND EXIT SELECTED FACILITIES BEGINNING IN THE FOURTH QUARTER OF 2008 AND CONTINUED THIS PROCESS THROUGH THE SECOND QUARTER OF 2010. WE\nVACATED AND CEASED USE OF THE FACILITIES IDENTIFIED UNDER THE PLAN. NON-CANCELABLE LEASE COSTS WERE DETERMINED BASED ON THE PRESENT VALUE OF REMAINING LEASE PAYMENTS REDUCED BY ESTIMATED SUBLEASE INCOME. PRESENT VALUE COMPUTATIONS USE DISCOUNT RATES\nBASED ON PUBLISHED TREASURY RISK-FREE INTEREST RATES, ADJUSTED FOR OUR CREDIT SPREAD, WHICH IS CONSISTENT WITH OBSERVABLE CREDIT SPREADS OF COMPANIES WITH SIMILAR CREDIT STANDING. THE COST OF EXITING AND TERMINATING OUR FACILITY LEASES WAS\nDETERMINED BY REFERRING TO THE CONTRACTUAL TERMS OF THE AGREEMENTS, BY EVALUATING THE CURRENT REAL ESTATE MARKET CONDITIONS, AND, WHERE APPLICABLE, BY REFERRING TO AMOUNTS IN NEGOTIATION. OUR ABILITY TO GENERATE THE ESTIMATED AMOUNTS OF SUBLEASE\nINCOME, AS WELL AS TO TERMINATE LEASE OBLIGATIONS AT THE ESTIMATED AMOUNTS, IS DEPENDENT UPON THE COMMERCIAL REAL ESTATE MARKET CONDITIONS IN CERTAIN GEOGRAPHIES AT THE TIME WE NEGOTIATE THE LEASE TERMINATION AND SUBLEASE ARRANGEMENTS WITH THIRD\nPARTIES. THESE AMOUNTS REPRESENT OUR BEST ESTIMATE OF THE OBLIGATIONS WE EXPECT TO INCUR AND COULD BE SUBJECT TO ADJUSTMENT AS MARKET CONDITIONS CHANGE. THE FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENT OF THE LIABILITY RELATED TO EXITED FACILITIES INVOLVES THE USE OF\nCERTAIN SIGNIFICANT UNOBSERVABLE INPUTS AND THEREFORE FALLS WITHIN LEVEL 3 OF THE FAIR VALUE HIERARCHY ESTABLISHED BY ACCOUNTING GUIDANCE (DESCRIBED IN NOTE 8\u0097\u0093INVESTMENTS\u0094 IN THE NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS).\nTHE REMAINING LEASE OBLIGATIONS WILL BE SETTLED OVER THE REMAINING LEASE TERMS WHICH EXPIRE THROUGH FISCAL 2017 AND WILL BE ADJUSTED FOR CHANGES IN ESTIMATES OR THE IMPACT OF SUBLEASE CONTRACTS.\nDURING THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2009, WE INCURRED TOTAL PRE-TAX CASH CHARGES FOR SEVERANCE, FACILITY, AND OTHER RESTRUCTURING COSTS OF\nAPPROXIMATELY $57 MILLION RELATED TO THE Q408 RESTRUCTURING PLAN, NET OF REVERSAL FOR ADJUSTMENTS TO ORIGINAL ESTIMATES TOTALING $8 MILLION.

THIS PRIMARILY OCCURS WITH REGARD TO OPTIONS GRANTED OUTSIDE THE U.S.\n\u0095\nOUR EFFECTIVE TAX RATE IN ALL PERIODS IS THE RESULT OF THE MIX OF INCOME EARNED IN VARIOUS TAX JURISDICTIONS THAT APPLY A BROAD RANGE OF INCOME TAX\nRATES. IN 2011, WE RECEIVED TAX RULINGS IN FOREIGN JURISDICTIONS THAT PROVIDED FAVORABLE TAX TREATMENTS.\n\u0095\nIN 2010, WE HAD A FAVORABLE RESOLUTION OF CERTAIN ISSUES IN AN IRS EXAMINATION OF OUR 2005 AND 2006 U.S. FEDERAL INCOME TAX RETURNS RESULTING IN A\nREDUCTION OF RESERVES FOR TAX UNCERTAINTIES AND THE AVAILABILITY OF CAPITAL LOSS CARRYFORWARDS TO OFFSET THE TAX ON THE GAIN FROM THE SALES OF ZIMBRA, INC. AND HOTJOBS. IN 2011, WE REACHED AGREEMENTS WITH CERTAIN STATE TAX AUTHORITIES IN CONNECTION\nWITH ADJUSTMENTS TO INCOME TAX RETURNS FOR YEARS PRIOR TO 2009.\n\u0095\nDURING 2010, IN CONNECTION WITH TAX RESTRUCTURING ACTIVITIES, WE REACHED A FORMAL AGREEMENT WITH THE IRS THROUGH A PRE-FILING AGREEMENT TO TREAT\nCERTAIN INTERCOMPANY BAD DEBTS AS DEDUCTIBLE BUSINESS EXPENSES ON THE 2009 FEDERAL INCOME TAX RETURN.\nOUR GROSS AMOUNT OF\nUNRECOGNIZED TAX BENEFITS AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2011 IS $533 MILLION, OF WHICH $394 MILLION IS RECORDED ON THE CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS. THE GROSS UNRECOGNIZED TAX BENEFITS AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2011 DECREASED BY $64 MILLION FROM THE RECORDED\nBALANCE AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2010 DUE TO FAVORABLE SETTLEMENTS OF TAX AUDITS IN 2011. SINCE THERE CAN BE NO ASSURANCE AS TO THE OUTCOME OF TAX AUDITS CURRENTLY IN PROGRESS, IT IS REASONABLY POSSIBLE THAT OVER THE NEXT TWELVE-MONTH PERIOD WE MAY\nEXPERIENCE AN INCREASE OR DECREASE IN OUR UNRECOGNIZED TAX BENEFITS. IT IS NOT POSSIBLE TO DETERMINE EITHER THE MAGNITUDE OR THE RANGE OF ANY INCREASE OR DECREASE AT THIS TIME.\nDURING THE LAST QUARTER OF 2011, WE COMMENCED DISCUSSIONS WITH THE IRS APPEALS DIVISION TO SETTLE THE CONTESTED ADJUSTMENTS FOR CERTAIN INTERCOMPANY TRANSFER PRICING MATTERS FROM THE 2005 AND 2006 INCOME\nTAX EXAMINATION. WHILE NO AGREEMENT HAS BEEN REACHED, THE DISCUSSIONS ARE PROCEEDING. IF THE MATTER IS RESOLVED ON THE BASIS THAT\n48\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nIS CURRENTLY BEING DISCUSSED WITH THE IRS, THEN THE SETTLEMENT WILL NOT CAUSE US TO HAVE TAX EXPOSURE BEYOND WHAT HAS ALREADY BEEN PROVIDED. IN ADDITION, OUR 2007 AND 2008 U.S. INCOME TAX RETURNS\nARE STILL UNDER IRS EXAMINATION.\nAS OF DECEMBER 31, 2011, WE WERE ALSO UNDER AUDIT BY THE CALIFORNIA FRANCHISE TAX BOARD FOR OUR 2005\nAND 2006 TAX RETURNS. WE BELIEVE OUR EXISTING RESERVES FOR ALL TAX MATTERS ARE ADEQUATE.\nWE ARE IN VARIOUS STAGES OF EXAMINATION AND APPEAL\nIN CONNECTION WITH OUR TAXES IN FOREIGN JURISDICTIONS, WHICH GENERALLY SPAN TAX YEARS 2005 THROUGH 2010. IT IS DIFFICULT TO DETERMINE WHEN THESE EXAMINATIONS WILL BE SETTLED OR WHAT THEIR FINAL OUTCOMES WILL BE. WE BELIEVE THAT WE HAVE ADEQUATELY\nPROVIDED FOR ANY REASONABLY FORESEEABLE ADJUSTMENT AND THAT ANY SETTLEMENT WILL NOT HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL POSITION, RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, OR CASH FLOWS.\nEARNINGS IN EQUITY INTERESTS.\nEARNINGS IN EQUITY INTERESTS FOR THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2011 WERE APPROXIMATELY $477 MILLION, COMPARED TO\n$396 MILLION AND $250 MILLION FOR 2010 AND 2009, RESPECTIVELY. EARNINGS IN EQUITY INTERESTS INCREASED DURING THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2011 COMPARED TO 2010 DUE PRIMARILY TO YAHOO JAPAN AND ALIBABA GROUP\u0092S CONTINUED IMPROVED FINANCIAL\nPERFORMANCE AND THE RECOGNITION OF A DILUTION GAIN OF $25 MILLION, NET OF TAX IN THIRD QUARTER OF 2011, RELATED TO OUR OWNERSHIP INTEREST IN ALIBABA GROUP OFFSET BY $33 MILLION IN NON-CASH LOSSES RELATED TO THE IMPAIRMENT OF ASSETS HELD BY YAHOO\nJAPAN.

IF REQUIRED FOR OUR OPERATIONS IN THE U.S., MOST OF THE CASH HELD ABROAD COULD BE REPATRIATED TO THE U.S. BUT, UNDER\nCURRENT LAW, WOULD BE SUBJECT TO U.S. FEDERAL INCOME TAXES (SUBJECT TO AN ADJUSTMENT FOR FOREIGN TAX CREDITS). CURRENTLY, WE DO NOT ANTICIPATE A NEED TO REPATRIATE THESE FUNDS FOR USE IN OUR U.S. OPERATIONS.\nWE INVEST EXCESS CASH PREDOMINANTLY IN MARKETABLE DEBT SECURITIES, MONEY MARKET FUNDS, AND TIME DEPOSITS THAT ARE LIQUID, HIGHLY RATED, AND THE MAJORITY\nOF WHICH HAVE EFFECTIVE MATURITIES OF LESS THAN ONE YEAR. OUR MARKETABLE DEBT AND EQUITY SECURITIES ARE CLASSIFIED AS AVAILABLE-FOR-SALE AND ARE REPORTED AT FAIR VALUE, WITH UNREALIZED GAINS AND LOSSES, NET OF TAX, RECORDED IN ACCUMULATED OTHER\nCOMPREHENSIVE INCOME. REALIZED GAINS OR LOSSES AND DECLINES IN VALUE JUDGED TO BE OTHER-THAN-TEMPORARY, IF ANY, ON AVAILABLE-FOR-SALE SECURITIES ARE REPORTED IN OTHER INCOME, NET. THE FAIR VALUE FOR SECURITIES IS DETERMINED BASED ON QUOTED MARKET\nPRICES OF THE HISTORICAL UNDERLYING SECURITY OR FROM READILY AVAILABLE PRICING SOURCES FOR THE IDENTICAL UNDERLYING SECURITIES THAT MAY NOT BE ACTIVELY TRADED AS OF THE VALUATION DATE. AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2011, CERTAIN OF OUR MARKETABLE DEBT\nSECURITIES HAD A FAIR\n53\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nVALUE BELOW COST DUE PRIMARILY TO THE CHANGES IN MARKET RATES OF INTEREST AND YIELDS ON THESE SECURITIES.

SEE NOTE 12\u0097\u0093COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES\u0094 IN THE NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR ADDITIONAL INFORMATION.\n(2)\nDURING THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2008, WE ENTERED INTO AN 11 YEAR LEASE AGREEMENT FOR A DATA CENTER IN THE WESTERN U.S. OF THE TOTAL\nEXPECTED MINIMUM LEASE COMMITMENT OF $105 MILLION, $21 MILLION WAS CLASSIFIED AS AN OPERATING LEASE FOR REAL ESTATE AND $84 MILLION WAS CLASSIFIED AS A CAPITAL LEASE FOR EQUIPMENT.\n(3)\nWE ARE OBLIGATED TO MAKE MINIMUM PAYMENTS UNDER CONTRACTS TO PROVIDE SPONSORED SEARCH AND\/OR DISPLAY ADVERTISING SERVICES TO OUR AFFILIATES, WHICH\nREPRESENT TAC.\n(4)\nWE ARE OBLIGATED TO MAKE PAYMENTS UNDER VARIOUS ARRANGEMENTS WITH VENDORS AND OTHER BUSINESS PARTNERS, PRINCIPALLY FOR MARKETING, BANDWIDTH, AND\nCONTENT ARRANGEMENTS.\n(5)\nAS OF DECEMBER 31, 2011, UNRECOGNIZED TAX BENEFITS AND POTENTIAL INTEREST AND PENALTIES RESULTED IN ACCRUED LIABILITIES OF $408 MILLION,\nCLASSIFIED AS DEFERRED AND OTHER LONG-TERM TAX LIABILITIES, NET ON OUR CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS. AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2011, THE SETTLEMENT PERIOD FOR THE $408 MILLION LONG-TERM INCOME TAX LIABILITIES CANNOT BE DETERMINED; HOWEVER, THE\nLIABILITIES ARE NOT EXPECTED TO RESULT IN CASH PAYMENTS OR BECOME DUE WITHIN THE NEXT TWELVE MONTHS.\nINTELLECTUAL\nPROPERTY RIGHTS.\nWE ARE COMMITTED TO MAKE CERTAIN PAYMENTS UNDER VARIOUS INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY ARRANGEMENTS OF UP TO $34 MILLION THROUGH 2023.\nOTHER COMMITMENTS.\nIN THE ORDINARY COURSE OF BUSINESS, WE MAY PROVIDE INDEMNIFICATIONS OF VARYING SCOPE AND TERMS TO CUSTOMERS, VENDORS, LESSORS, JOINT VENTURE AND BUSINESS PARTNERS, PURCHASERS OF\nASSETS OR SUBSIDIARIES AND OTHER PARTIES WITH RESPECT TO CERTAIN MATTERS, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, LOSSES ARISING OUT OF OUR BREACH OF AGREEMENTS OR REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES MADE BY US, SERVICES TO BE PROVIDED BY US, INTELLECTUAL\nPROPERTY INFRINGEMENT CLAIMS MADE BY THIRD PARTIES OR, WITH RESPECT TO THE SALE OF ASSETS OR A SUBSIDIARY, MATTERS RELATED TO OUR CONDUCT OF THE BUSINESS AND TAX MATTERS PRIOR TO THE SALE. IN ADDITION, WE HAVE ENTERED INTO INDEMNIFICATION AGREEMENTS\nWITH OUR DIRECTORS AND CERTAIN OF OUR OFFICERS THAT WILL REQUIRE US, AMONG OTHER THINGS, TO INDEMNIFY THEM AGAINST CERTAIN LIABILITIES THAT MAY ARISE BY REASON OF THEIR STATUS OR SERVICE AS DIRECTORS OR OFFICERS. WE HAVE ALSO AGREED TO INDEMNIFY\nCERTAIN FORMER OFFICERS, DIRECTORS, AND EMPLOYEES OF ACQUIRED COMPANIES IN CONNECTION WITH THE ACQUISITION OF SUCH COMPANIES. WE MAINTAIN DIRECTOR AND OFFICER INSURANCE, WHICH MAY COVER CERTAIN LIABILITIES ARISING FROM OUR OBLIGATION TO INDEMNIFY\nOUR DIRECTORS AND OFFICERS AND FORMER DIRECTORS AND OFFICERS OF ACQUIRED COMPANIES, IN CERTAIN CIRCUMSTANCES. IT IS NOT POSSIBLE TO DETERMINE THE AGGREGATE MAXIMUM POTENTIAL LOSS UNDER THESE INDEMNIFICATION AGREEMENTS DUE TO THE LIMITED HISTORY OF\nPRIOR INDEMNIFICATION CLAIMS AND THE UNIQUE FACTS AND CIRCUMSTANCES INVOLVED IN EACH PARTICULAR AGREEMENT. SUCH INDEMNIFICATION AGREEMENTS MIGHT NOT BE SUBJECT TO MAXIMUM LOSS CLAUSES. HISTORICALLY, WE HAVE NOT INCURRED MATERIAL COSTS AS A RESULT OF\nOBLIGATIONS UNDER THESE AGREEMENTS AND WE HAVE NOT ACCRUED ANY LIABILITIES RELATED TO SUCH INDEMNIFICATION OBLIGATIONS IN OUR CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.\nAS OF DECEMBER 31, 2011, WE DID NOT HAVE ANY RELATIONSHIPS WITH UNCONSOLIDATED ENTITIES OR FINANCIAL PARTNERSHIPS, SUCH AS ENTITIES OFTEN REFERRED TO AS STRUCTURED FINANCE OR SPECIAL PURPOSE\nENTITIES, WHICH WOULD HAVE BEEN ESTABLISHED FOR THE PURPOSE OF FACILITATING OFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS OR OTHER CONTRACTUALLY NARROW OR LIMITED PURPOSES. IN ADDITION, AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2011, WE HAD NO OFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS THAT\nHAVE, OR ARE REASONABLY LIKELY TO HAVE, A CURRENT OR FUTURE MATERIAL EFFECT ON OUR CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL CONDITION, RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, LIQUIDITY, CAPITAL EXPENDITURES, OR CAPITAL RESOURCES.\nCRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES\nOUR DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF OUR FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS IS BASED UPON OUR CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS, WHICH HAVE BEEN PREPARED IN ACCORDANCE WITH U.S. GAAP. THE PREPARATION\nOF THESE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS REQUIRES US TO MAKE ESTIMATES, JUDGMENTS, AND ASSUMPTIONS THAT AFFECT THE REPORTED AMOUNTS OF ASSETS, LIABILITIES, REVENUE AND EXPENSES, AND THE RELATED DISCLOSURE OF CONTINGENT ASSETS AND\n56\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nLIABILITIES. WE BASE OUR ESTIMATES ON HISTORICAL EXPERIENCE AND ON VARIOUS OTHER ASSUMPTIONS THAT WE BELIEVE ARE REASONABLE UNDER THE CIRCUMSTANCES, THE RESULTS OF WHICH FORM THE BASIS FOR MAKING\nJUDGMENTS ABOUT THE CARRYING VALUES OF ASSETS AND LIABILITIES THAT ARE NOT READILY APPARENT FROM OTHER SOURCES. ACTUAL RESULTS MAY DIFFER FROM THESE ESTIMATES.\nAN ACCOUNTING POLICY IS CONSIDERED TO BE CRITICAL IF IT REQUIRES AN ACCOUNTING ESTIMATE TO BE MADE BASED ON ASSUMPTIONS ABOUT MATTERS THAT ARE HIGHLY UNCERTAIN AT THE TIME THE ESTIMATE IS MADE, AND IF\nDIFFERENT ESTIMATES THAT REASONABLY COULD HAVE BEEN USED, OR CHANGES IN THE ACCOUNTING ESTIMATE THAT ARE REASONABLY LIKELY TO OCCUR, COULD MATERIALLY IMPACT THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS. WE BELIEVE THAT THE FOLLOWING CRITICAL ACCOUNTING\nPOLICIES REFLECT THE MORE SIGNIFICANT ESTIMATES AND ASSUMPTIONS USED IN THE PREPARATION OF THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.\nMANAGEMENT\nHAS DISCUSSED THE DEVELOPMENT AND SELECTION OF THESE CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES WITH THE AUDIT COMMITTEE OF OUR BOARD, AND THE AUDIT COMMITTEE HAS REVIEWED THE DISCLOSURE BELOW. IN ADDITION, THERE ARE OTHER ITEMS WITHIN OUR FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nTHAT REQUIRE ESTIMATION, BUT ARE NOT DEEMED CRITICAL AS DEFINED ABOVE. CHANGES IN ESTIMATES USED IN THESE AND OTHER ITEMS COULD HAVE A MATERIAL IMPACT ON OUR CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.\nREVENUE RECOGNITION.\nOUR REVENUE IS GENERATED FROM DISPLAY, SEARCH, AND OTHER. DISPLAY REVENUE IS GENERATED FROM THE DISPLAY OF GRAPHICAL\nADVERTISEMENTS AND SEARCH REVENUE IS GENERATED FROM THE DISPLAY OF TEXT-BASED LINKS TO AN ADVERTISER\u0092S WEBSITE AND FROM REVENUE SHARING ARRANGEMENTS WITH PARTNERS FOR SEARCH TECHNOLOGY AND SERVICES. OTHER REVENUE CONSISTS OF LISTINGS-BASED\nSERVICES REVENUE, TRANSACTION REVENUE, AND FEES REVENUE. WHILE THE MAJORITY OF OUR REVENUE TRANSACTIONS CONTAIN STANDARD BUSINESS TERMS AND CONDITIONS, THERE ARE CERTAIN TRANSACTIONS THAT CONTAIN NON-STANDARD BUSINESS TERMS AND CONDITIONS. IN\nADDITION, WE ENTER INTO CERTAIN SALES TRANSACTIONS THAT INVOLVE MULTIPLE ELEMENTS (ARRANGEMENTS WITH MORE THAN ONE DELIVERABLE). WE ALSO ENTER INTO ARRANGEMENTS TO PURCHASE GOODS AND\/OR SERVICES FROM CERTAIN CUSTOMERS. AS A RESULT, SIGNIFICANT\nCONTRACT INTERPRETATION IS SOMETIMES REQUIRED TO DETERMINE THE APPROPRIATE ACCOUNTING FOR THESE TRANSACTIONS INCLUDING: (1) WHETHER AN ARRANGEMENT EXISTS; (2) WHETHER FEES ARE FIXED OR DETERMINABLE; (3) HOW THE ARRANGEMENT\nCONSIDERATION SHOULD BE ALLOCATED AMONG POTENTIAL MULTIPLE ELEMENTS; (4) ESTABLISHING SELLING PRICES FOR DELIVERABLES CONSIDERING MULTIPLE FACTORS; (5) WHEN TO RECOGNIZE REVENUE ON THE DELIVERABLES; (6) WHETHER ALL ELEMENTS OF THE\nARRANGEMENT HAVE BEEN DELIVERED; (7) WHETHER THE ARRANGEMENT SHOULD BE REPORTED GROSS AS A PRINCIPAL VERSUS NET AS AN AGENT; (8) WHETHER WE RECEIVE A SEPARATELY IDENTIFIABLE BENEFIT FROM THE PURCHASE ARRANGEMENTS WITH CERTAIN CUSTOMERS FOR\nWHICH WE CAN REASONABLY ESTIMATE FAIR VALUE; AND (9) WHETHER THE CONSIDERATION RECEIVED FROM A VENDOR SHOULD BE CHARACTERIZED AS REVENUE OR A REIMBURSEMENT OF COSTS INCURRED. IN ADDITION, OUR REVENUE RECOGNITION POLICY REQUIRES AN ASSESSMENT AS\nTO WHETHER COLLECTION IS REASONABLY ASSURED, WHICH INHERENTLY REQUIRES US TO EVALUATE THE CREDITWORTHINESS OF OUR CUSTOMERS. CHANGES IN JUDGMENTS ON THESE ASSUMPTIONS AND ESTIMATES COULD MATERIALLY IMPACT THE TIMING OR AMOUNT OF REVENUE RECOGNITION.\nINCOME TAXES.\nSIGNIFICANT JUDGMENT IS REQUIRED IN EVALUATING OUR UNCERTAIN TAX POSITIONS AND DETERMINING OUR PROVISION FOR INCOME\nTAXES. SEE NOTE 9\u0097\u0093INCOME TAXES\u0094 IN THE NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR ADDITIONAL INFORMATION. WE ESTABLISH RESERVES FOR TAX-RELATED UNCERTAINTIES BASED ON ESTIMATES OF WHETHER, AND THE EXTENT TO WHICH, ADDITIONAL\nTAXES WILL BE DUE. THESE RESERVES ARE ESTABLISHED WHEN WE BELIEVE THAT CERTAIN POSITIONS MIGHT BE CHALLENGED DESPITE OUR BELIEF THAT OUR TAX RETURN POSITIONS ARE IN ACCORDANCE WITH APPLICABLE TAX LAWS. WE ADJUST THESE RESERVES IN LIGHT OF CHANGING\nFACTS AND CIRCUMSTANCES, SUCH AS THE CLOSING OF A TAX AUDIT, NEW TAX LEGISLATION, OR THE CHANGE OF AN ESTIMATE BASED ON NEW INFORMATION. TO THE EXTENT THAT THE FINAL TAX OUTCOME OF THESE MATTERS IS DIFFERENT THAN THE AMOUNTS RECORDED, SUCH\nDIFFERENCES WILL AFFECT THE PROVISION FOR INCOME TAXES IN THE PERIOD IN WHICH SUCH DETERMINATION IS MADE. THE PROVISION FOR INCOME TAXES INCLUDES THE EFFECT OF RESERVE PROVISIONS AND CHANGES TO RESERVES THAT ARE CONSIDERED APPROPRIATE, AS WELL AS\nTHE RELATED NET INTEREST AND PENALTIES.\nWE RECORD A VALUATION ALLOWANCE AGAINST CERTAIN OF OUR DEFERRED INCOME TAX ASSETS IF IT IS MORE\nLIKELY THAN NOT THAT THOSE ASSETS WILL NOT BE REALIZED. IN EVALUATING OUR ABILITY TO REALIZE OUR DEFERRED INCOME TAX ASSETS WE CONSIDER ALL AVAILABLE POSITIVE AND NEGATIVE EVIDENCE, INCLUDING OUR OPERATING RESULTS, ONGOING TAX PLANNING, AND\nFORECASTS OF\n57\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nFUTURE TAXABLE INCOME ON A JURISDICTION BY JURISDICTION BASIS. IN THE EVENT WE WERE TO DETERMINE THAT WE WOULD BE ABLE TO REALIZE THESE DEFERRED INCOME TAX ASSETS IN THE FUTURE, WE WOULD MAKE AN\nADJUSTMENT TO THE VALUATION ALLOWANCE, WHICH WOULD REDUCE THE PROVISION FOR INCOME TAXES.\nGOODWILL.\nGOODWILL IS NOT AMORTIZED,\nBUT IS TESTED FOR IMPAIRMENT ON AN ANNUAL BASIS AND BETWEEN ANNUAL TESTS IN CERTAIN CIRCUMSTANCES. THE PERFORMANCE OF THE GOODWILL IMPAIRMENT TEST INVOLVES A TWO-STEP PROCESS. THE FIRST STEP INVOLVES COMPARING THE FAIR VALUE OF OUR REPORTING UNITS\nTO THEIR CARRYING VALUES, INCLUDING GOODWILL. IF THE CARRYING VALUE OF THE REPORTING UNIT EXCEEDS ITS FAIR VALUE, THE SECOND STEP OF THE TEST IS PERFORMED BY COMPARING THE CARRYING VALUE OF THE GOODWILL IN THE REPORTING UNIT TO ITS IMPLIED FAIR\nVALUE. AN IMPAIRMENT CHARGE IS RECOGNIZED FOR THE EXCESS OF THE CARRYING VALUE OF GOODWILL OVER ITS IMPLIED FAIR VALUE.\nOUR REPORTING UNITS\nARE BASED ON GEOGRAPHY, EITHER AT THE OPERATING SEGMENT LEVEL OR ONE LEVEL BELOW OPERATING SEGMENTS. THE FAIR VALUES OF OUR REPORTING UNITS ARE ESTIMATED USING AN AVERAGE OF A MARKET APPROACH AND AN INCOME APPROACH AS THIS COMBINATION IS DEEMED TO\nBE THE MOST INDICATIVE OF OUR FAIR VALUE IN AN ORDERLY TRANSACTION BETWEEN MARKET PARTICIPANTS AND IS CONSISTENT WITH THE METHODOLOGY USED FOR THE GOODWILL IMPAIRMENT TEST IN PRIOR YEARS. IN ADDITION, WE ENSURE THAT THE FAIR VALUES ESTIMATED UNDER\nTHESE TWO APPROACHES ARE COMPARABLE WITH EACH OTHER. UNDER THE MARKET APPROACH, WE UTILIZE PUBLICLY-TRADED COMPARABLE COMPANY INFORMATION TO DETERMINE REVENUE AND EARNINGS MULTIPLES THAT ARE USED TO VALUE OUR REPORTING UNITS ADJUSTED FOR AN\nESTIMATED CONTROL PREMIUM. UNDER THE INCOME APPROACH, WE DETERMINE FAIR VALUE BASED ON ESTIMATED FUTURE CASH FLOWS OF EACH REPORTING UNIT DISCOUNTED BY AN ESTIMATED WEIGHTED-AVERAGE COST OF CAPITAL, REFLECTING THE OVERALL LEVEL OF INHERENT RISK OF A\nREPORTING UNIT AND THE RATE OF RETURN AN OUTSIDE INVESTOR WOULD EXPECT TO EARN. DETERMINING THE FAIR VALUE OF A REPORTING UNIT IS JUDGMENTAL IN NATURE AND REQUIRES THE USE OF SIGNIFICANT ESTIMATES AND ASSUMPTIONS, INCLUDING SELECTION OF MARKET\nCOMPARABLES, ESTIMATED FUTURE CASH FLOWS, AND DISCOUNT RATES. THESE COMPONENTS ARE DISCUSSED BELOW.\n\u0095\nMARKET COMPARABLES\nWE SELECT COMPARABLE COMPANIES IN THE SPECIFIC REGIONS IN WHICH OUR REPORTING UNITS OPERATE BASED ON SIMILARITY OF TYPE OF BUSINESS, PRIMARILY THOSE INVOLVED IN ONLINE ADVERTISING, RELATIVE SIZE,\nFINANCIAL PROFILE, AND OTHER CHARACTERISTICS OF THOSE COMPANIES COMPARED TO OUR REPORTING UNITS. TRAILING AND FORWARD REVENUE AND EARNINGS MULTIPLES DERIVED FROM THESE COMPARABLE COMPANIES ARE APPLIED TO FINANCIAL METRICS OF EACH REPORTING UNIT TO\nDETERMINE THEIR ESTIMATED FAIR VALUES, ADJUSTED FOR AN ESTIMATED CONTROL PREMIUM.\n\u0095\nESTIMATED FUTURE CASH FLOWS\nWE BASE CASH FLOW PROJECTIONS FOR EACH REPORTING UNIT USING A FIVE-YEAR FORECAST OF CASH FLOWS AND A TERMINAL VALUE BASED ON THE PERPETUITY GROWTH MODEL. THE FIVE-YEAR FORECAST AND RELATED ASSUMPTIONS\nWERE DERIVED FROM THE MOST RECENT ANNUAL FINANCIAL FORECAST FOR WHICH THE PLANNING PROCESS COMMENCED IN OUR FOURTH QUARTER. KEY ASSUMPTIONS IN ESTIMATING FUTURE CASH FLOWS INCLUDE, AMONG OTHER ITEMS, REVENUE AND OPERATING EXPENSE GROWTH RATES,\nTERMINAL VALUE GROWTH RATE, AND CAPITAL EXPENDITURE AND WORKING CAPITAL LEVELS.\n\u0095\nDISCOUNT RATES\nWE EMPLOY A WEIGHTED AVERAGE COST OF CAPITAL (\u0093WACC\u0094) APPROACH TO DETERMINE THE DISCOUNT RATES USED IN OUR CASH FLOW PROJECTIONS. THE DETERMINATION OF THE DISCOUNT RATES FOR EACH REPORTING UNIT\nINCLUDES FACTORS SUCH AS THE RISK-FREE RATE OF RETURN AND THE RETURN AN OUTSIDE INVESTOR WOULD EXPECT TO EARN BASED ON THE OVERALL LEVEL OF INHERENT RISK. THE DETERMINATION OF EXPECTED RETURNS INCLUDES CONSIDERATION OF THE BETA (A MEASURE OF RISK)\nOF TRADED SECURITIES OF COMPARABLE COMPANIES AND RISK PREMIUMS OF REPORTING UNITS BASED ON INTERNATIONAL COST OF CAPITAL METHODS.\nTHE SUM OF\nTHE FAIR VALUES OF OUR REPORTING UNITS IS RECONCILED TO OUR MARKET CAPITALIZATION AFTER CONSIDERING AN ESTIMATED CONTROL PREMIUM.\nWE\nCONDUCTED OUR ANNUAL GOODWILL IMPAIRMENT TEST AS OF OCTOBER 31, 2011 AND DETERMINED THAT THE FAIR VALUES OF OUR REPORTING UNITS EXCEEDED THEIR CARRYING VALUES AND THEREFORE GOODWILL IN THOSE REPORTING UNITS WAS NOT IMPAIRED.\n58\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nSIGNIFICANT MANAGEMENT JUDGMENT IS INVOLVED IN DETERMINING THESE ESTIMATES AND ASSUMPTIONS. CHANGES IN THESE\nESTIMATES AND ASSUMPTIONS COULD MATERIALLY AFFECT THE DETERMINATION OF FAIR VALUE FOR EACH REPORTING UNIT WHICH COULD TRIGGER FUTURE IMPAIRMENT.\nLONG-LIVED ASSETS\n. WE AMORTIZE LONG-LIVED ASSETS OVER THEIR ESTIMATED USEFUL LIVES. IDENTIFIABLE LONG-LIVED ASSETS ARE REVIEWED FOR IMPAIRMENT WHENEVER EVENTS OR CHANGES IN CIRCUMSTANCES INDICATE\nTHAT THE CARRYING VALUE MAY NOT BE RECOVERABLE. DETERMINATION OF RECOVERABILITY IS BASED ON THE LOWEST LEVEL OF IDENTIFIABLE ESTIMATED UNDISCOUNTED FUTURE CASH FLOWS RESULTING FROM USE OF THE ASSET AND ITS EVENTUAL DISPOSITION. MEASUREMENT OF ANY\nIMPAIRMENT LOSS IS BASED ON THE EXCESS OF THE CARRYING VALUE OF THE ASSET OVER ITS FAIR VALUE. FAIR VALUE IS DETERMINED BASED ON THE LOWEST LEVEL OF IDENTIFIABLE ESTIMATED FUTURE CASH FLOWS USING DISCOUNT RATES DETERMINED BY OUR MANAGEMENT TO BE\nCOMMENSURATE WITH THE RISK INHERENT IN OUR BUSINESS MODEL. OUR ESTIMATES OF FUTURE CASH FLOWS ATTRIBUTABLE TO OUR LONG-LIVED ASSETS REQUIRE SIGNIFICANT JUDGMENT BASED ON OUR HISTORICAL AND ANTICIPATED RESULTS AND ARE SUBJECT TO MANY FACTORS.\nDIFFERENT ASSUMPTIONS AND JUDGMENTS COULD MATERIALLY AFFECT ESTIMATED FUTURE CASH FLOWS RELATING TO OUR LONG-LIVED ASSETS WHICH COULD TRIGGER IMPAIRMENT. NO IMPAIRMENTS OF LONG-LIVED ASSETS WERE IDENTIFIED DURING ANY OF THE PERIODS PRESENTED.\nINVESTMENTS IN EQUITY INTERESTS.\nWE ACCOUNT FOR INVESTMENTS IN THE COMMON STOCK OF ENTITIES IN WHICH WE HAVE THE ABILITY TO EXERCISE\nSIGNIFICANT INFLUENCE BUT DO NOT OWN A MAJORITY EQUITY INTEREST OR OTHERWISE CONTROL USING THE EQUITY METHOD. IN ACCOUNTING FOR THESE INVESTMENTS WE RECORD OUR PROPORTIONATE SHARE OF THE ENTITIES\u0092 NET INCOME OR LOSS, ONE QUARTER IN ARREARS.\nWE REVIEW OUR INVESTMENTS IN EQUITY INTERESTS FOR IMPAIRMENT WHENEVER EVENTS OR CHANGES IN BUSINESS CIRCUMSTANCES INDICATE THAT THE CARRYING\nVALUE OF THE INVESTMENT MAY NOT BE FULLY RECOVERABLE. INVESTMENTS IDENTIFIED AS HAVING AN INDICATION OF IMPAIRMENT ARE SUBJECT TO FURTHER ANALYSIS TO DETERMINE IF THE IMPAIRMENT IS OTHER-THAN-TEMPORARY AND THIS ANALYSIS REQUIRES ESTIMATING THE FAIR\nVALUE OF THE INVESTMENT. THE DETERMINATION OF FAIR VALUE OF THE INVESTMENT INVOLVES CONSIDERING FACTORS SUCH AS THE STOCK PRICES OF PUBLIC COMPANIES IN WHICH WE HAVE AN EQUITY INVESTMENT, CURRENT ECONOMIC AND MARKET CONDITIONS, THE OPERATING\nPERFORMANCE OF THE COMPANIES, INCLUDING CURRENT EARNINGS TRENDS AND FORECASTED CASH FLOWS, AND OTHER COMPANY AND INDUSTRY SPECIFIC INFORMATION. THE FAIR VALUE DETERMINATION, PARTICULARLY FOR INVESTMENTS IN PRIVATELY-HELD COMPANIES, REQUIRES\nSIGNIFICANT JUDGMENT TO DETERMINE APPROPRIATE ESTIMATES AND ASSUMPTIONS. CHANGES IN THESE ESTIMATES AND ASSUMPTIONS COULD AFFECT THE CALCULATION OF THE FAIR VALUE OF THE INVESTMENTS AND THE DETERMINATION OF WHETHER ANY IDENTIFIED IMPAIRMENT IS\nOTHER-THAN-TEMPORARY.\nSTOCK-BASED COMPENSATION EXPENSE.\nWE RECOGNIZE STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION EXPENSE NET OF AN ESTIMATED FORFEITURE\nRATE AND THEREFORE ONLY RECOGNIZE COMPENSATION EXPENSE FOR THOSE SHARES EXPECTED TO VEST OVER THE SERVICE PERIOD OF THE AWARD. CALCULATING STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION EXPENSE REQUIRES THE INPUT OF HIGHLY SUBJECTIVE ASSUMPTIONS, INCLUDING THE EXPECTED\nTERM OF THE STOCK-BASED OPTIONS, STOCK PRICE VOLATILITY, AND THE PRE-VESTING AWARD FORFEITURE RATE. WE ESTIMATE THE EXPECTED LIFE OF OPTIONS GRANTED BASED ON HISTORICAL EXERCISE PATTERNS, WHICH WE BELIEVE ARE REPRESENTATIVE OF FUTURE BEHAVIOR. WE\nESTIMATE THE VOLATILITY OF OUR COMMON STOCK ON THE DATE OF GRANT BASED ON THE IMPLIED VOLATILITY OF PUBLICLY TRADED OPTIONS ON OUR COMMON STOCK, WITH A TERM OF ONE YEAR OR GREATER. WE BELIEVE THAT IMPLIED VOLATILITY CALCULATED BASED ON ACTIVELY\nTRADED OPTIONS ON OUR COMMON STOCK IS A BETTER INDICATOR OF EXPECTED VOLATILITY AND FUTURE STOCK PRICE TRENDS THAN HISTORICAL VOLATILITY.\nTHEREFORE, EXPECTED VOLATILITY FOR THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2011 WAS BASED ON A MARKET-BASED IMPLIED VOLATILITY. THE ASSUMPTIONS USED IN\nCALCULATING THE FAIR VALUE OF STOCK-BASED AWARDS REPRESENT OUR BEST ESTIMATES, BUT THESE ESTIMATES INVOLVE INHERENT UNCERTAINTIES AND THE APPLICATION OF MANAGEMENT JUDGMENT. AS A RESULT, IF FACTORS CHANGE AND WE USE DIFFERENT ASSUMPTIONS, OUR\nSTOCK-BASED COMPENSATION EXPENSE COULD BE MATERIALLY DIFFERENT IN THE FUTURE. IN ADDITION, WE ARE REQUIRED TO ESTIMATE THE EXPECTED PRE-VESTING AWARD FORFEITURE RATE, AS WELL AS THE PROBABILITY THAT PERFORMANCE CONDITIONS THAT AFFECT THE VESTING OF\nCERTAIN AWARDS WILL BE ACHIEVED, AND ONLY RECOGNIZE EXPENSE FOR THOSE SHARES EXPECTED TO VEST. WE ESTIMATE THIS FORFEITURE RATE BASED ON HISTORICAL EXPERIENCE OF OUR STOCK-BASED AWARDS THAT ARE GRANTED AND CANCELLED BEFORE VESTING. IF OUR ACTUAL\nFORFEITURE RATE IS MATERIALLY DIFFERENT FROM OUR ORIGINAL ESTIMATES, THE STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION EXPENSE COULD BE SIGNIFICANTLY\n59\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nDIFFERENT FROM WHAT WE HAVE RECORDED IN THE CURRENT PERIOD. CHANGES IN THE ESTIMATED FORFEITURE RATE CAN HAVE A SIGNIFICANT EFFECT ON REPORTED STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION EXPENSE, AS THE EFFECT OF\nADJUSTING THE FORFEITURE RATE FOR ALL CURRENT AND PREVIOUSLY RECOGNIZED EXPENSE FOR UNVESTED AWARDS IS RECOGNIZED IN THE PERIOD THE FORFEITURE ESTIMATE IS CHANGED. IN ADDITION, BECAUSE MANY OF OUR STOCK-BASED AWARDS HAVE VESTING SCHEDULES OF TWO OR\nTHREE YEARS CLIFF VESTS, A SIGNIFICANT CHANGE IN OUR ACTUAL OR EXPECTED FORFEITURE EXPERIENCE WILL RESULT IN THE ADJUSTMENT OF STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION WHICH WAS RECORDED IN PRIOR YEARS FOR ALL UNVESTED AWARDS. IF THE ACTUAL FORFEITURE RATE IS\nHIGHER THAN THE ESTIMATED FORFEITURE RATE, THEN AN ADJUSTMENT WILL BE MADE TO INCREASE THE ESTIMATED FORFEITURE RATE, WHICH WILL RESULT IN A DECREASE TO THE EXPENSE RECOGNIZED IN THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS. IF THE ACTUAL FORFEITURE RATE\nIS LOWER THAN THE ESTIMATED FORFEITURE RATE, THEN AN ADJUSTMENT WILL BE MADE TO LOWER THE ESTIMATED FORFEITURE RATE, WHICH WILL RESULT IN AN INCREASE TO THE EXPENSE RECOGNIZED IN THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS. SEE\nNOTE 11\u0097\u0093EMPLOYEE BENEFITS\u0094 IN THE NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR ADDITIONAL INFORMATION.\nRECENT\nACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS\nSEE NOTE 1\u0097\u0093THE COMPANY AND SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES\u0094 IN THE NOTES TO THE\nCONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS, WHICH IS INCORPORATED HEREIN BY REFERENCE.","15289":"ITEM 7.    MANAGEMENT\u0092S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS\nOF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nWE BEGIN MANAGEMENT\u0092S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF\nOPERATIONS WITH AN OVERVIEW OF OUR KEY OPERATING BUSINESS SEGMENTS AND SIGNIFICANT TRENDS. THIS OVERVIEW IS FOLLOWED BY A SUMMARY OF OUR CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES THAT WE BELIEVE ARE IMPORTANT TO UNDERSTANDING THE ASSUMPTIONS AND\nJUDGMENTS INCORPORATED IN OUR REPORTED FINANCIAL RESULTS. WE THEN PROVIDE A MORE DETAILED ANALYSIS OF OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION.\nBUSINESS OVERVIEW\nWE ARE THE WORLD\u0092S LARGEST PROVIDER OF ENTERPRISE SOFTWARE AND A\nLEADING PROVIDER OF COMPUTER HARDWARE PRODUCTS AND SERVICES. OUR SOFTWARE, HARDWARE SYSTEMS, AND SERVICES BUSINESSES DEVELOP, MANUFACTURE, MARKET, HOST AND SUPPORT DATABASE AND MIDDLEWARE SOFTWARE, APPLICATIONS SOFTWARE, AND HARDWARE SYSTEMS, WITH\nTHE LATTER CONSISTING PRIMARILY OF COMPUTER SERVER AND STORAGE PRODUCTS. OUR BUSINESSES PROVIDE PRODUCTS AND SERVICES THAT ARE BUILT UPON INDUSTRY STANDARDS, ARE ENGINEERED TO WORK TOGETHER OR INDEPENDENTLY WITHIN EXISTING CUSTOMER INFORMATION\nTECHNOLOGY (IT) ENVIRONMENTS AND RUN SECURELY ON A WIDE RANGE OF CUSTOMER IT ENVIRONMENTS, INCLUDING CLOUD COMPUTING ENVIRONMENTS.\nCLOUD\nCOMPUTING ENVIRONMENTS PROVIDE ON DEMAND ACCESS TO A SHARED POOL OF COMPUTING RESOURCES IN A SCALABLE, SELF-SERVICE MANNER, DELIVERING ADVANTAGES IN SPEED, AGILITY AND EFFICIENCY. CLOUD COMPUTING HAS EVOLVED FROM TECHNOLOGIES AND SERVICES THAT\nORACLE HAS PROVIDED FOR MANY YEARS, INCLUDING CLUSTERING, SERVER VIRTUALIZATION, SERVICE-ORIENTED ARCHITECTURE (SOA), SHARED SERVICES, LARGE-SCALE MANAGEMENT AUTOMATION, AND MORE RECENTLY, ENGINEERED SYSTEMS. OUR SECURE, RELIABLE AND SCALABLE\nPRODUCT OFFERINGS ARE DESIGNED TO IMPROVE BUSINESS EFFICIENCIES AT A LOW TOTAL COST OF OWNERSHIP. WE SEEK TO BE AN INDUSTRY LEADER IN EACH OF THE PRODUCT OFFERING CATEGORIES IN WHICH WE COMPETE AND TO EXPAND INTO NEW AND EMERGING MARKETS.\nWE BELIEVE OUR ABILITY TO OFFER OUR CUSTOMERS CHOICE AND FLEXIBILITY IN THE MANNER IN WHICH THEY DEPLOY OUR PRODUCTS AND SERVICES\u0097WHILE\nMAINTAINING ENTERPRISE-GRADE RELIABILITY, SECURITY AND INTEROPERABILITY BASED UPON INDUSTRY-STANDARDS\u0097IS IMPORTANT TO OUR CORPORATE STRATEGY. ORACLE FUSION APPLICATIONS, FOR EXAMPLE, OFFER CUSTOMERS A CHOICE OF DEPLOYMENT MODELS TO RUN OUR\nSTANDARDS-BASED SOFTWARE APPLICATIONS IN ON-PREMISE OR CLOUD COMPUTING IT ENVIRONMENTS. ORACLE CLOUD, A FAMILY OF OUR CLOUD-BASED SOFTWARE SUBSCRIPTION OFFERINGS, PROVIDES ACCESS TO SELECT ORACLE SOFTWARE APPLICATIONS AND SOFTWARE PLATFORMS ON A\nSUBSCRIPTION BASIS IN A SECURE, STANDARDS-BASED CLOUD COMPUTING ENVIRONMENT. ORACLE CLOUD INCLUDES SOFTWARE APPLICATIONS AS A SERVICE, SUCH AS ORACLE FUSION HUMAN CAPITAL MANAGEMENT CLOUD SERVICE AND ORACLE FUSION CUSTOMER RELATIONSHIP MANAGEMENT\nCLOUD SERVICE, AND SOFTWARE PLATFORM SERVICES SUCH AS ORACLE DATABASE CLOUD SERVICE AND ORACLE JAVA CLOUD SERVICE, AMONG OTHERS.\nWE BELIEVE\nOUR INTERNAL GROWTH AND CONTINUED INNOVATION WITH RESPECT TO OUR SOFTWARE, HARDWARE AND SERVICES BUSINESSES ARE THE FOUNDATION OF OUR LONG-TERM STRATEGIC PLANS. IN EACH OF FISCAL 2012 AND 2011, WE INVESTED $4.5 BILLION AND IN FISCAL 2010 WE INVESTED\n$3.3 BILLION IN RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT TO ENHANCE OUR EXISTING PORTFOLIO OF PRODUCTS AND SERVICES AND TO DEVELOP NEW PRODUCTS AND SERVICES. WE CONTINUE TO FOCUS THE ENGINEERING OF OUR HARDWARE AND SOFTWARE PRODUCTS TO MAKE THEM WORK TOGETHER MORE\nEFFECTIVELY AND DELIVER IMPROVED COMPUTING PERFORMANCE, RELIABILITY, AND SECURITY TO OUR CUSTOMERS. FOR EXAMPLE, ORACLE ENGINEERED SYSTEMS, WHICH INCLUDE OUR ORACLE EXADATA DATABASE MACHINE, ORACLE EXALOGIC ELASTIC CLOUD, AND SPARC SUPERCLUSTER\nPRODUCTS, AMONGST OTHERS, COMBINE CERTAIN OF OUR HARDWARE AND SOFTWARE OFFERINGS TO PROVIDE ENGINEERED SYSTEMS THAT INCREASE COMPUTING PERFORMANCE AND REDUCE STORAGE REQUIREMENTS RELATIVE TO OUR COMPETITORS\u0092 PRODUCTS, CREATING TIME SAVINGS,\nEFFICIENCIES, AND OPERATIONAL COST ADVANTAGES FOR OUR CUSTOMERS.\nWE ALSO BELIEVE THAT AN ACTIVE ACQUISITION PROGRAM IS AN IMPORTANT ELEMENT OF\nOUR CORPORATE STRATEGY AS IT STRENGTHENS OUR COMPETITIVE POSITION, ENHANCES THE PRODUCTS AND SERVICES THAT WE CAN OFFER TO CUSTOMERS, EXPANDS OUR CUSTOMER BASE, PROVIDES GREATER SCALE TO ACCELERATE INNOVATION, GROWS OUR REVENUES AND EARNINGS AND\nINCREASES STOCKHOLDER VALUE. IN RECENT YEARS, WE HAVE INVESTED BILLIONS OF DOLLARS TO ACQUIRE A NUMBER OF COMPANIES, PRODUCTS, SERVICES AND TECHNOLOGIES THAT ADD TO, ARE COMPLEMENTARY TO, OR HAVE OTHERWISE ENHANCED OUR EXISTING OFFERINGS. WE EXPECT\nTO CONTINUE TO ACQUIRE COMPANIES, PRODUCTS, SERVICES AND TECHNOLOGIES TO FURTHER OUR CORPORATE STRATEGY.\n38\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nWE ARE ORGANIZED INTO THREE BUSINESSES\u0097SOFTWARE, HARDWARE SYSTEMS AND SERVICES\u0097WHICH ARE FURTHER\nDIVIDED INTO CERTAIN OPERATING SEGMENTS. PRIOR TO OUR ACQUISITION OF SUN MICROSYSTEMS, INC. (SUN) IN JANUARY 2010, WE DID NOT HAVE A HARDWARE SYSTEMS BUSINESS OR RELATED OPERATING SEGMENTS. EACH OF OUR BUSINESSES AND OPERATING SEGMENTS HAS UNIQUE\nCHARACTERISTICS AND FACES DIFFERENT OPPORTUNITIES AND CHALLENGES. ALTHOUGH WE REPORT OUR ACTUAL RESULTS IN U.S. DOLLARS, WE CONDUCT A SIGNIFICANT NUMBER OF TRANSACTIONS IN CURRENCIES OTHER THAN U.S. DOLLARS. THEREFORE, WE PRESENT CONSTANT CURRENCY\nINFORMATION TO PROVIDE A FRAMEWORK FOR ASSESSING HOW OUR UNDERLYING BUSINESSES PERFORMED EXCLUDING THE EFFECT OF FOREIGN CURRENCY RATE FLUCTUATIONS. AN OVERVIEW OF OUR THREE BUSINESSES AND RELATED OPERATING SEGMENTS FOLLOWS.\nSOFTWARE BUSINESS\nOUR\nSOFTWARE BUSINESS, WHICH REPRESENTED 70%, 68% AND 77% OF OUR TOTAL REVENUES IN FISCAL 2012, 2011 AND 2010, RESPECTIVELY, IS COMPRISED OF TWO OPERATING SEGMENTS: (1) NEW SOFTWARE LICENSES AND (2) SOFTWARE LICENSE UPDATES AND PRODUCT\nSUPPORT. ON A CONSTANT CURRENCY BASIS, WE EXPECT THAT OUR SOFTWARE BUSINESS\u0092 TOTAL REVENUES GENERALLY WILL CONTINUE TO INCREASE DUE TO CONTINUED DEMAND FOR OUR SOFTWARE PRODUCTS AND SOFTWARE LICENSE UPDATES AND PRODUCT SUPPORT OFFERINGS,\nINCLUDING THE HIGH PERCENTAGE OF CUSTOMERS THAT RENEW THEIR SOFTWARE LICENSE UPDATES AND PRODUCT SUPPORT CONTRACTS AND DUE TO OUR ACQUISITIONS, WHICH SHOULD ALLOW US TO GROW OUR PROFITS AND CONTINUE TO MAKE INVESTMENTS IN RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT.\nNEW SOFTWARE LICENSES.\nWE LICENSE OUR DATABASE AND MIDDLEWARE AS WELL AS OUR APPLICATIONS SOFTWARE AND\nPROVIDE SUBSCRIPTION-BASED ACCESS TO SELECT ORACLE SOFTWARE APPLICATIONS AND SOFTWARE PLATFORMS THROUGH A CLOUD-BASED IT ENVIRONMENT TO BUSINESSES OF MANY SIZES, GOVERNMENT AGENCIES, EDUCATIONAL INSTITUTIONS AND RESELLERS. THE GROWTH IN NEW SOFTWARE\nLICENSE REVENUES THAT WE REPORT IS AFFECTED BY THE STRENGTH OF GENERAL ECONOMIC AND BUSINESS CONDITIONS, GOVERNMENTAL BUDGETARY CONSTRAINTS, THE COMPETITIVE POSITION OF OUR SOFTWARE PRODUCTS, OUR ACQUISITIONS AND FOREIGN CURRENCY FLUCTUATIONS. THE\nSUBSTANTIAL MAJORITY OF OUR NEW SOFTWARE LICENSE BUSINESS IS ALSO CHARACTERIZED BY LONG SALES CYCLES. THE TIMING OF A FEW LARGE SOFTWARE LICENSE TRANSACTIONS CAN SUBSTANTIALLY AFFECT OUR QUARTERLY NEW SOFTWARE LICENSE REVENUES. SINCE OUR NEW\nSOFTWARE LICENSE REVENUES IN A PARTICULAR QUARTER CAN BE DIFFICULT TO PREDICT AS A RESULT OF THE TIMING OF A FEW LARGE SOFTWARE LICENSE TRANSACTIONS, WE BELIEVE THAT ANALYSIS OF NEW SOFTWARE LICENSE REVENUES ON A TRAILING 4-QUARTER PERIOD (AS\nPROVIDED IN OUR QUARTERLY REPORTS ON FORM 10-Q) PROVIDES ADDITIONAL VISIBILITY INTO THE UNDERLYING PERFORMANCE OF OUR NEW SOFTWARE LICENSE BUSINESS. NEW SOFTWARE LICENSE REVENUES REPRESENTED 27%, 26% AND 28% OF OUR TOTAL REVENUES IN FISCAL 2012,\n2011 AND 2010, RESPECTIVELY. THE PROPORTION OF OUR NEW SOFTWARE LICENSE REVENUES RELATIVE TO OUR TOTAL REVENUES WAS AFFECTED BY OUR ENTRY INTO THE HARDWARE SYSTEMS BUSINESS AS A RESULT OF OUR ACQUISITION OF SUN IN THE THIRD QUARTER OF FISCAL 2010.\nOUR NEW SOFTWARE LICENSE SEGMENT\u0092S MARGINS HAVE HISTORICALLY TRENDED UPWARD OVER THE COURSE OF THE FOUR QUARTERS WITHIN A PARTICULAR FISCAL YEAR DUE TO THE HISTORICAL UPWARD TREND OF OUR NEW SOFTWARE LICENSE REVENUES OVER THOSE QUARTERLY\nPERIODS AND BECAUSE THE MAJORITY OF OUR COSTS FOR THIS SEGMENT ARE PREDOMINANTLY FIXED IN THE SHORT-TERM. HOWEVER, OUR NEW SOFTWARE LICENSE SEGMENT\u0092S MARGINS HAVE BEEN AND WILL CONTINUE TO BE AFFECTED BY FAIR VALUE ADJUSTMENTS RELATING TO THE\nCLOUD SOFTWARE SUBSCRIPTION OBLIGATIONS THAT WE ASSUMED IN BUSINESS COMBINATIONS (DESCRIBED FURTHER BELOW) AND BY THE AMORTIZATION OF INTANGIBLE ASSETS ASSOCIATED WITH COMPANIES AND TECHNOLOGIES THAT WE HAVE ACQUIRED.\nWE RECORDED ADJUSTMENTS TO REDUCE OBLIGATIONS UNDER OUR ASSUMED CLOUD SOFTWARE SUBSCRIPTION OFFERINGS IN BUSINESS COMBINATIONS TO THEIR ESTIMATED FAIR\nVALUES AT THE ACQUISITION DATES. AS A RESULT, AS REQUIRED BY BUSINESS COMBINATION ACCOUNTING RULES, WE DID NOT RECOGNIZE CLOUD SOFTWARE SUBSCRIPTION REVENUES AS A PART OF OUR NEW SOFTWARE LICENSES REVENUES THAT WOULD HAVE BEEN OTHERWISE RECORDED AS\nREVENUES BY THE ACQUIRED BUSINESSES AS INDEPENDENT ENTITIES IN THE AMOUNT OF $22 MILLION IN FISCAL 2012. TO THE EXTENT UNDERLYING CLOUD SOFTWARE SUBSCRIPTION CONTRACTS ARE RENEWED WITH US FOLLOWING AN ACQUISITION, WE WILL RECOGNIZE THE REVENUES FOR\nTHE FULL VALUE OF THE CLOUD SOFTWARE SUBSCRIPTION CONTRACTS OVER THE CONTRACT PERIODS.\nSOFTWARE LICENSE UPDATES AND PRODUCT\nSUPPORT.\nCUSTOMERS THAT PURCHASE SOFTWARE LICENSE UPDATES AND PRODUCT SUPPORT ARE GRANTED RIGHTS TO UNSPECIFIED PRODUCT UPGRADES AND MAINTENANCE RELEASES ISSUED DURING THE SUPPORT PERIOD, AS WELL AS TECHNICAL SUPPORT\nASSISTANCE. SUBSTANTIALLY ALL OF OUR CUSTOMERS RENEW THEIR SOFTWARE LICENSE UPDATES AND PRODUCT SUPPORT CONTRACTS ANNUALLY. THE GROWTH OF SOFTWARE LICENSE UPDATES AND PRODUCT SUPPORT REVENUES IS PRIMARILY INFLUENCED BY THREE FACTORS: (1) THE\nPERCENTAGE OF OUR SUPPORT CONTRACT CUSTOMER BASE THAT RENEWS ITS SUPPORT CONTRACTS, (2) THE AMOUNT OF NEW SUPPORT CONTRACTS SOLD IN CONNECTION\n39\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nWITH THE SALE OF NEW SOFTWARE LICENSES AND (3) THE AMOUNT OF SUPPORT CONTRACTS ASSUMED FROM COMPANIES WE HAVE ACQUIRED.\nSOFTWARE LICENSE UPDATES AND PRODUCT SUPPORT REVENUES, WHICH REPRESENTED 43%, 42% AND 49% OF OUR TOTAL REVENUES IN FISCAL 2012, 2011 AND 2010, RESPECTIVELY, IS OUR HIGHEST MARGIN BUSINESS UNIT. THE\nPROPORTION OF OUR SOFTWARE LICENSE UPDATES AND PRODUCT SUPPORT REVENUES RELATIVE TO OUR TOTAL REVENUES WAS AFFECTED BY OUR ENTRY INTO THE HARDWARE SYSTEMS BUSINESS AS A RESULT OF OUR ACQUISITION OF SUN IN THE THIRD QUARTER OF FISCAL 2010. MARGINS\nDURING FISCAL 2012 WERE 87% AND ACCOUNTED FOR 72% OF OUR TOTAL MARGINS OVER THE SAME PERIOD. OUR SOFTWARE LICENSE UPDATE AND PRODUCT SUPPORT MARGINS HAVE BEEN AFFECTED BY FAIR VALUE ADJUSTMENTS RELATING TO SOFTWARE SUPPORT OBLIGATIONS ASSUMED IN\nBUSINESS COMBINATIONS (DESCRIBED FURTHER BELOW) AND BY AMORTIZATION OF INTANGIBLE ASSETS. HOWEVER, OVER THE LONGER TERM, WE BELIEVE THAT SOFTWARE LICENSE UPDATES AND PRODUCT SUPPORT REVENUES AND MARGINS WILL GROW FOR THE FOLLOWING REASONS.\n\u0095\nSUBSTANTIALLY ALL OF OUR CUSTOMERS, INCLUDING CUSTOMERS FROM ACQUIRED COMPANIES, RENEW THEIR SUPPORT CONTRACTS WHEN ELIGIBLE FOR RENEWAL;\n\u0095\nSUBSTANTIALLY ALL OF OUR CUSTOMERS PURCHASE SOFTWARE LICENSE UPDATES AND PRODUCT SUPPORT CONTRACTS WHEN THEY BUY NEW SOFTWARE LICENSES, RESULTING IN A\nFURTHER INCREASE IN OUR SUPPORT CONTRACT BASE. EVEN IF NEW SOFTWARE LICENSE REVENUES GROWTH WAS FLAT, SOFTWARE LICENSE UPDATES AND PRODUCT SUPPORT REVENUES WOULD CONTINUE TO GROW IN COMPARISON TO THE CORRESPONDING PRIOR YEAR PERIODS ASSUMING RENEWAL\nAND CANCELLATION RATES AND FOREIGN CURRENCY RATES REMAINED RELATIVELY CONSTANT SINCE SUBSTANTIALLY ALL NEW SOFTWARE LICENSE TRANSACTIONS RESULT IN THE SALE OF SOFTWARE LICENSE UPDATES AND PRODUCT SUPPORT CONTRACTS, WHICH ADD TO OUR SUPPORT CONTRACT\nBASE; AND\n\u0095\nOUR ACQUISITIONS HAVE INCREASED OUR SUPPORT CONTRACT BASE, AS WELL AS THE PORTFOLIO OF PRODUCTS AVAILABLE TO BE LICENSED AND SUPPORTED.\nWE RECORDED ADJUSTMENTS TO REDUCE SUPPORT OBLIGATIONS ASSUMED IN BUSINESS COMBINATIONS TO THEIR ESTIMATED FAIR VALUES AT THE\nACQUISITION DATES. AS A RESULT, AS REQUIRED BY BUSINESS COMBINATION ACCOUNTING RULES, WE DID NOT RECOGNIZE SOFTWARE LICENSE UPDATES AND PRODUCT SUPPORT REVENUES RELATED TO SOFTWARE SUPPORT CONTRACTS THAT WOULD HAVE BEEN OTHERWISE RECORDED BY THE\nACQUIRED BUSINESSES AS INDEPENDENT ENTITIES IN THE AMOUNTS OF $48 MILLION, $80 MILLION AND $86 MILLION IN FISCAL 2012, 2011 AND 2010, RESPECTIVELY. TO THE EXTENT UNDERLYING SUPPORT CONTRACTS ARE RENEWED WITH US FOLLOWING AN ACQUISITION, WE WILL\nRECOGNIZE THE REVENUES FOR THE FULL VALUE OF THE SUPPORT CONTRACTS OVER THE SUPPORT PERIODS, THE MAJORITY OF WHICH ARE ONE YEAR.\nHARDWARE SYSTEMS BUSINESS\nOUR HARDWARE SYSTEMS BUSINESS CONSISTS OF TWO OPERATING SEGMENTS: (1) HARDWARE SYSTEMS PRODUCTS AND (2) HARDWARE SYSTEMS SUPPORT. OUR HARDWARE\nBUSINESS REPRESENTED 17%, 19% AND 9% OF OUR TOTAL REVENUES IN FISCAL 2012, 2011 AND 2010, RESPECTIVELY. WE EXPECT OUR HARDWARE BUSINESS TO HAVE LOWER OPERATING MARGINS AS A PERCENTAGE OF REVENUES THAN OUR SOFTWARE BUSINESS DUE TO THE INCREMENTAL\nCOSTS WE INCUR TO PRODUCE AND DISTRIBUTE THESE PRODUCTS AND TO PROVIDE SUPPORT SERVICES, INCLUDING DIRECT MATERIALS AND LABOR COSTS. WE EXPECT TO MAKE INVESTMENTS IN RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT TO IMPROVE EXISTING HARDWARE PRODUCTS AND SERVICES AND TO\nDEVELOP NEW HARDWARE PRODUCTS AND SERVICES.\nHARDWARE SYSTEMS PRODUCTS.\nWE PROVIDE A COMPLETE SELECTION OF\nHARDWARE SYSTEMS AND RELATED SERVICES INCLUDING SERVERS, STORAGE, NETWORKING, VIRTUALIZATION SOFTWARE, OPERATING SYSTEMS, AND MANAGEMENT SOFTWARE TO SUPPORT DIVERSE IT ENVIRONMENTS, INCLUDING PUBLIC AND PRIVATE CLOUD COMPUTING ENVIRONMENTS. WE\nENGINEER OUR HARDWARE SYSTEMS WITH VIRTUALIZATION AND MANAGEMENT CAPABILITIES TO ENABLE THE RAPID DEPLOYMENT AND EFFICIENT MANAGEMENT OF CLOUD INFRASTRUCTURES. OUR HARDWARE SYSTEMS PRODUCTS CONSIST PRIMARILY OF COMPUTER SERVER, STORAGE AND\nHARDWARE-RELATED SOFTWARE, INCLUDING OUR ORACLE SOLARIS OPERATING SYSTEM. OUR HARDWARE SYSTEMS COMPONENT PRODUCTS ARE DESIGNED TO BE \u0093OPEN,\u0094 OR TO WORK IN CUSTOMER ENVIRONMENTS THAT MAY INCLUDE OTHER ORACLE OR NON-ORACLE HARDWARE OR\nSOFTWARE COMPONENTS. WE HAVE ALSO ENGINEERED OUR HARDWARE SYSTEMS PRODUCTS TO CREATE PERFORMANCE AND OPERATIONAL COST ADVANTAGES FOR CUSTOMERS WHEN OUR HARDWARE AND SOFTWARE PRODUCTS ARE COMBINED AS ORACLE ENGINEERED SYSTEMS.\n40\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nOUR ORACLE ENGINEERED SYSTEMS INCLUDE ORACLE EXADATA DATABASE MACHINE, ORACLE EXALOGIC ELASTIC CLOUD, ORACLE\nEXALYTICS IN-MEMORY MACHINE, SPARC SUPERCLUSTER, ORACLE DATABASE APPLIANCE AND THE ORACLE BIG DATA APPLIANCE. BY COMBINING OUR SERVER AND STORAGE HARDWARE WITH OUR SOFTWARE, OUR OPEN, INTEGRATED PRODUCTS BETTER ADDRESS CUSTOMER ON-PREMISE AND CLOUD\nCOMPUTING REQUIREMENTS FOR PERFORMANCE, SCALABILITY, RELIABILITY, SECURITY, EASE OF MANAGEMENT AND LOWER TOTAL COST OF OWNERSHIP.\nWE OFFER A\nWIDE RANGE OF SERVER SYSTEMS USING OUR SPARC MICROPROCESSOR. OUR SPARC SERVERS ARE DIFFERENTIATED BY THEIR RELIABILITY, SECURITY, SCALABILITY AND CUSTOMER ENVIRONMENTS THAT THEY TARGET (GENERAL PURPOSE OR SPECIALIZED SYSTEMS). OUR MIDSIZE AND LARGE\nSERVERS ARE DESIGNED TO OFFER GREATER PERFORMANCE AND LOWER TOTAL COST OF OWNERSHIP THAN MAINFRAME SYSTEMS FOR BUSINESS CRITICAL APPLICATIONS AND FOR CUSTOMERS HAVING MORE COMPUTATIONALLY INTENSIVE NEEDS. OUR SPARC SERVERS RUN THE ORACLE SOLARIS\nOPERATING SYSTEM AND ARE DESIGNED FOR THE MOST DEMANDING MISSION CRITICAL ENTERPRISE ENVIRONMENTS AT ANY SCALE.\nWE ALSO OFFER ENTERPRISE X86\nSERVERS. THESE X86 SERVERS ARE PRIMARILY BASED ON MICROPROCESSOR PLATFORMS FROM INTEL CORPORATION AND ARE ALSO COMPATIBLE WITH ORACLE SOLARIS, ORACLE LINUX, MICROSOFT WINDOWS AND OTHER OPERATING SYSTEMS.\nOUR NETRA LINE OF SERVERS ARE AIMED AT THE UNIQUE NEEDS OF ORIGINAL EQUIPMENT MANUFACTURERS (OEMS) AND NETWORK EQUIPMENT PROVIDERS. RACK-OPTIMIZED SYSTEMS\nAND OUR BLADE PRODUCT OFFERINGS COMBINE HIGH-DENSITY HARDWARE ARCHITECTURE AND SYSTEM MANAGEMENT SOFTWARE THAT OEMS FIND PARTICULARLY USEFUL IN BUILDING THEIR OWN SOLUTION ARCHITECTURES.\nOUR STORAGE PRODUCTS ARE DESIGNED TO SECURELY MANAGE, PROTECT, ARCHIVE AND RESTORE CUSTOMERS\u0092 MISSION CRITICAL DATA ASSETS AND CONSIST OF TAPE, DISK, HARDWARE-RELATED SOFTWARE INCLUDING FILE SYSTEMS\nSOFTWARE, BACK-UP AND ARCHIVE SOFTWARE AND STORAGE MANAGEMENT SOFTWARE AND NETWORKING FOR MAINFRAME AND OPEN SYSTEMS ENVIRONMENTS.\nTHE\nMAJORITY OF OUR HARDWARE SYSTEMS PRODUCTS ARE SOLD THROUGH INDIRECT CHANNELS, INCLUDING INDEPENDENT DISTRIBUTORS AND VALUE ADDED RESELLERS.\nTO\nPRODUCE OUR HARDWARE PRODUCTS, WE RELY ON BOTH OUR INTERNAL MANUFACTURING OPERATIONS AS WELL AS THIRD PARTY MANUFACTURING PARTNERS. OUR INTERNAL MANUFACTURING OPERATIONS CONSIST PRIMARILY OF FINAL ASSEMBLY, TEST AND QUALITY CONTROL OF ENTERPRISE AND\nDATA CENTER SERVERS AND STORAGE SYSTEMS. FOR ALL OTHER MANUFACTURING, WE RELY ON THIRD PARTY MANUFACTURING PARTNERS. WE DISTRIBUTE MOST OF OUR HARDWARE PRODUCTS EITHER FROM OUR FACILITIES OR PARTNER FACILITIES. WE STRIVE TO REDUCE COSTS BY\nSIMPLIFYING OUR MANUFACTURING PROCESSES THROUGH INCREASED STANDARDIZATION OF COMPONENTS ACROSS PRODUCT TYPES AND A \u0093BUILD-TO-ORDER\u0094 MANUFACTURING PROCESS IN WHICH PRODUCTS GENERALLY ARE BUILT ONLY AFTER CUSTOMERS HAVE PLACED FIRM ORDERS.\nIN ADDITION, WE SEEK TO ENHANCE HARDWARE SYSTEMS SUPPORT PROCESSES THAT ARE DESIGNED TO PROACTIVELY IDENTIFY AND SOLVE QUALITY ISSUES AND TO INCREASE THE AMOUNT OF NEW HARDWARE SYSTEMS SUPPORT CONTRACTS SOLD IN CONNECTION WITH THE SALES OF NEW\nHARDWARE PRODUCTS.\nOUR HARDWARE SYSTEMS PRODUCTS REVENUES, COST OF HARDWARE SYSTEMS PRODUCTS AND OPERATING MARGINS THAT WE REPORT ARE AFFECTED\nBY THE STRENGTH OF GENERAL ECONOMIC AND BUSINESS CONDITIONS, GOVERNMENTAL BUDGETARY CONSTRAINTS, OUR STRATEGY FOR AND THE COMPETITIVE POSITION OF OUR HARDWARE SYSTEMS PRODUCTS, OUR ACQUISITIONS AND FOREIGN CURRENCY RATE FLUCTUATIONS. IN ADDITION,\nOUR OPERATING MARGINS FOR OUR HARDWARE SYSTEMS PRODUCTS SEGMENT HAVE BEEN AND WILL BE AFFECTED BY THE AMORTIZATION OF INTANGIBLE ASSETS.\nWE\nHAVE LIMITED EXPERIENCE IN PREDICTING OUR QUARTERLY HARDWARE SYSTEMS PRODUCTS REVENUES. THE TIMING OF CUSTOMER ORDERS AND DELAYS IN OUR ABILITY TO TIMELY MANUFACTURE OR DELIVER A FEW LARGE TRANSACTIONS COULD SUBSTANTIALLY AFFECT THE AMOUNT OF\nHARDWARE SYSTEMS PRODUCTS REVENUES, EXPENSES AND OPERATING MARGINS THAT WE REPORT.\nHARDWARE SYSTEMS\nSUPPORT.\nOUR HARDWARE SYSTEMS SUPPORT OFFERINGS PROVIDE CUSTOMERS WITH SOFTWARE UPDATES FOR THE SOFTWARE COMPONENTS THAT ARE ESSENTIAL TO THE FUNCTIONALITY OF OUR SERVER AND STORAGE PRODUCTS, SUCH AS ORACLE SOLARIS,\nAND CAN INCLUDE PRODUCT REPAIRS, MAINTENANCE SERVICES AND TECHNICAL SUPPORT SERVICES. TYPICALLY, OUR HARDWARE SYSTEMS SUPPORT CONTRACT ARRANGEMENTS ARE INVOICED TO THE CUSTOMER AT THE BEGINNING OF THE SUPPORT PERIOD AND ARE ONE YEAR IN DURATION. OUR\nHARDWARE SYSTEMS SUPPORT REVENUES THAT WE REPORT ARE INFLUENCED BY A\n41\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nNUMBER OF FACTORS, INCLUDING THE VOLUME OF PURCHASES OF HARDWARE PRODUCTS, THE MIX OF HARDWARE PRODUCTS PURCHASED AND THE PERCENTAGE OF OUR HARDWARE SYSTEMS SUPPORT CONTRACT CUSTOMER BASE THAT\nRENEWS ITS SUPPORT CONTRACTS. ALL OF THESE FACTORS ARE HEAVILY INFLUENCED BY OUR CUSTOMERS\u0092 DECISIONS TO EITHER MAINTAIN OR UPGRADE THEIR EXISTING HARDWARE SYSTEMS\u0092 INFRASTRUCTURE TO NEWLY DEVELOPED TECHNOLOGIES THAT ARE AVAILABLE.\nOUR HARDWARE SYSTEMS SUPPORT MARGINS HAVE BEEN AND WILL BE AFFECTED BY OUR ACQUISITIONS AND RELATED ACCOUNTING INCLUDING FAIR VALUE\nADJUSTMENTS RELATING TO HARDWARE SYSTEMS SUPPORT OBLIGATIONS ASSUMED AND BY THE AMORTIZATION OF INTANGIBLE ASSETS. AS REQUIRED BY BUSINESS COMBINATION ACCOUNTING RULES, WE RECORDED ADJUSTMENTS TO REDUCE OUR HARDWARE SYSTEMS SUPPORT REVENUES FOR\nCONTRACTS ASSUMED FROM OUR ACQUISITIONS TO THEIR ESTIMATED FAIR VALUES. THESE AMOUNTS WOULD HAVE BEEN RECORDED AS HARDWARE SYSTEMS SUPPORT REVENUES BY THE ACQUIRED BUSINESSES AS INDEPENDENT ENTITIES IN THE AMOUNTS OF $30 MILLION, $148 MILLION AND\n$128 MILLION FOR FISCAL 2012, 2011 AND 2010, RESPECTIVELY.\nTO THE EXTENT UNDERLYING HARDWARE SYSTEMS SUPPORT CONTRACTS ARE RENEWED WITH US\nFOLLOWING AN ACQUISITION, WE WILL RECOGNIZE THE REVENUES FOR THE FULL VALUES OF THE HARDWARE SYSTEMS SUPPORT CONTRACTS OVER THE SUPPORT PERIODS.\nSERVICES BUSINESS\nOUR SERVICES BUSINESS IS COMPRISED OF THE REMAINDER OF OUR\nOPERATING SEGMENTS AND OFFERS CONSULTING SERVICES, MANAGED CLOUD SERVICES AND EDUCATION SERVICES. OUR SERVICES BUSINESS, WHICH REPRESENTED 13% OF OUR TOTAL REVENUES IN EACH OF FISCAL 2012 AND 2011 AND 14% OF OUR TOTAL REVENUES IN FISCAL 2010, HAS\nLOWER MARGINS THAN OUR SOFTWARE AND HARDWARE BUSINESSES. THE PROPORTION OF OUR SERVICES REVENUES RELATIVE TO OUR TOTAL REVENUES WAS AFFECTED BY OUR ENTRY INTO THE HARDWARE SYSTEMS BUSINESS AS A RESULT OF OUR ACQUISITION OF SUN IN THE THIRD QUARTER\nOF FISCAL 2010. OUR SERVICES REVENUES ARE IMPACTED BY CERTAIN OF OUR ACQUISITIONS, GENERAL ECONOMIC CONDITIONS, PERSONNEL REDUCTIONS IN OUR CUSTOMERS\u0092 IT DEPARTMENTS, TIGHTER CONTROLS OVER DISCRETIONARY SPENDING AND THE GROWTH IN OUR SOFTWARE\nAND HARDWARE SYSTEMS PRODUCTS REVENUES.\nOUR CONSULTING LINE OF BUSINESS PRIMARILY PROVIDES SERVICES TO CUSTOMERS IN BUSINESS AND IT STRATEGY\nALIGNMENT, ENTERPRISE ARCHITECTURE PLANNING AND DESIGN, INITIAL PRODUCT IMPLEMENTATION AND INTEGRATION AND ONGOING PRODUCT ENHANCEMENTS AND UPGRADES. THE AMOUNT OF CONSULTING REVENUES RECOGNIZED TENDS TO LAG THE AMOUNT OF OUR SOFTWARE AND HARDWARE\nSYSTEMS PRODUCTS REVENUES BY SEVERAL QUARTERS SINCE CONSULTING SERVICES, IF PURCHASED, ARE TYPICALLY SEGMENTABLE FROM THE PRODUCTS WITH WHICH THEY RELATE AND ARE PERFORMED AFTER THE CUSTOMER\u0092S PURCHASE OF THE PRODUCTS. OUR SERVICES REVENUES AS\nTHEY RELATE TO CONSULTING SERVICES ARE DEPENDENT UPON GENERAL ECONOMIC CONDITIONS AND THE LEVEL OF OUR PRODUCT REVENUES, IN PARTICULAR THE NEW SOFTWARE LICENSE SALES OF OUR APPLICATION PRODUCTS. TO THE EXTENT WE ARE ABLE TO GROW OUR PRODUCTS\nREVENUES, IN PARTICULAR OUR SOFTWARE APPLICATION PRODUCT REVENUES, WE WOULD ALSO GENERALLY EXPECT TO BE ABLE TO EVENTUALLY GROW OUR CONSULTING REVENUES.\nORACLE MANAGED CLOUD SERVICES PROVIDE COMPREHENSIVE SOFTWARE AND HARDWARE MANAGEMENT AND MAINTENANCE SERVICES\u0097INCLUDING DEPLOYMENT, MANAGEMENT, MONITORING, PATCHING, SECURITY AND UPGRADE\nSERVICES\u0097FOR CUSTOMERS HOSTED AT OUR ORACLE DATA CENTER FACILITIES, SELECT PARTNER DATA CENTERS, OR PHYSICALLY ON-PREMISE AT CUSTOMER FACILITIES. ADDITIONALLY, WE PROVIDE SUPPORT SERVICES, BOTH ON-PREMISE AND REMOTE, TO ORACLE CUSTOMERS TO\nENABLE INCREASED PERFORMANCE AND HIGHER AVAILABILITY OF THEIR PRODUCTS AND SERVICES. WE BELIEVE THAT OUR MANAGED CLOUD SERVICES OFFERINGS PROVIDE OUR CUSTOMERS WITH GREATER VALUE AND CHOICE THROUGH INCREASED BUSINESS PERFORMANCE, REDUCED RISK, A\nPREDICTABLE COST AND MORE FLEXIBILITY IN TERMS OF SERVICE IN ORDER TO MAXIMIZE THE PERFORMANCE OF THEIR ORACLE SOFTWARE AND HARDWARE PRODUCTS AND SERVICES.\nEDUCATION SERVICES PROVIDE TRAINING TO CUSTOMERS, PARTNERS AND EMPLOYEES AS A PART OF OUR MISSION TO FURTHER THE ADOPTION AND USAGE OF OUR SOFTWARE AND HARDWARE PRODUCTS BY OUR CUSTOMERS AND CREATE\nOPPORTUNITIES TO GROW OUR PRODUCTS REVENUES.\nACQUISITIONS\nAN ACTIVE ACQUISITION PROGRAM IS ANOTHER IMPORTANT ELEMENT OF OUR CORPORATE STRATEGY. IN RECENT YEARS, WE HAVE INVESTED BILLIONS OF DOLLARS TO ACQUIRE A NUMBER OF COMPLEMENTARY COMPANIES, PRODUCTS,\nSERVICES AND TECHNOLOGIES INCLUDING TALEO CORPORATION (TALEO) AND RIGHTNOW TECHNOLOGIES, INC (RIGHTNOW) IN FISCAL 2012,\n42\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nAND ART TECHNOLOGY GROUP, INC. (ATG) AND PHASE FORWARD INCORPORATED (PHASE FORWARD) IN FISCAL 2011, AMONG OTHERS. WE BELIEVE OUR ACQUISITION PROGRAM STRENGTHENS OUR COMPETITIVE POSITION, ENHANCES\nTHE PRODUCTS AND SERVICES THAT WE CAN OFFER TO CUSTOMERS, EXPANDS OUR CUSTOMER BASE, PROVIDES GREATER SCALE TO ACCELERATE INNOVATION, GROWS OUR REVENUES AND EARNINGS AND INCREASES STOCKHOLDER VALUE. WE EXPECT TO CONTINUE TO ACQUIRE COMPANIES,\nPRODUCTS, SERVICES AND TECHNOLOGIES IN FURTHERANCE OF OUR CORPORATE STRATEGY. NOTE 2 OF NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS INCLUDED ELSEWHERE IN THIS ANNUAL REPORT PROVIDES ADDITIONAL INFORMATION RELATED TO OUR RECENT ACQUISITIONS.\nWE BELIEVE WE CAN FUND OUR FUTURE ACQUISITIONS WITH OUR INTERNALLY AVAILABLE CASH, CASH EQUIVALENTS AND MARKETABLE SECURITIES, CASH GENERATED\nFROM OPERATIONS, ADDITIONAL BORROWINGS OR FROM THE ISSUANCE OF ADDITIONAL SECURITIES. WE ESTIMATE THE FINANCIAL IMPACT OF ANY POTENTIAL ACQUISITION WITH REGARD TO EARNINGS, OPERATING MARGIN, CASH FLOW AND RETURN ON INVESTED CAPITAL TARGETS BEFORE\nDECIDING TO MOVE FORWARD WITH AN ACQUISITION.\nCRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES\nOUR CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS ARE PREPARED IN ACCORDANCE WITH U.S. GENERALLY ACCEPTED ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES (GAAP) AS SET FORTH IN THE FINANCIAL\nACCOUNTING STANDARDS BOARD\u0092S (FASB) ACCOUNTING STANDARDS CODIFICATION (CODIFICATION) AND CONSIDER THE VARIOUS STAFF ACCOUNTING BULLETINS AND OTHER APPLICABLE GUIDANCE ISSUED BY THE SEC. GAAP, AS SET FORTH WITHIN THE CODIFICATION, REQUIRES US TO\nMAKE CERTAIN ESTIMATES, JUDGMENTS AND ASSUMPTIONS. WE BELIEVE THAT THE ESTIMATES, JUDGMENTS AND ASSUMPTIONS UPON WHICH WE RELY ARE REASONABLE BASED UPON INFORMATION AVAILABLE TO US AT THE TIME THAT THESE ESTIMATES, JUDGMENTS AND ASSUMPTIONS ARE\nMADE. THESE ESTIMATES, JUDGMENTS AND ASSUMPTIONS CAN AFFECT THE REPORTED AMOUNTS OF ASSETS AND LIABILITIES AS OF THE DATE OF THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AS WELL AS THE REPORTED AMOUNTS OF REVENUES AND EXPENSES DURING THE PERIODS PRESENTED. TO THE\nEXTENT THERE ARE DIFFERENCES BETWEEN THESE ESTIMATES, JUDGMENTS OR ASSUMPTIONS AND ACTUAL RESULTS, OUR FINANCIAL STATEMENTS WILL BE AFFECTED. THE ACCOUNTING POLICIES THAT REFLECT OUR MORE SIGNIFICANT ESTIMATES, JUDGMENTS AND ASSUMPTIONS AND WHICH WE\nBELIEVE ARE THE MOST CRITICAL TO AID IN FULLY UNDERSTANDING AND EVALUATING OUR REPORTED FINANCIAL RESULTS INCLUDE THE FOLLOWING.\n\u0095\nREVENUE RECOGNITION\n\u0095\nBUSINESS COMBINATIONS\n\u0095\nGOODWILL AND INTANGIBLE ASSETS\u0097IMPAIRMENT ASSESSMENTS\n\u0095\nACCOUNTING FOR INCOME TAXES\n\u0095\nLEGAL AND OTHER CONTINGENCIES\n\u0095\nSTOCK-BASED COMPENSATION\n\u0095\nALLOWANCES FOR DOUBTFUL ACCOUNTS\nIN MANY CASES, THE ACCOUNTING TREATMENT OF A PARTICULAR TRANSACTION IS SPECIFICALLY DICTATED BY GAAP AND DOES NOT REQUIRE MANAGEMENT\u0092S JUDGMENT IN ITS APPLICATION. THERE ARE ALSO AREAS IN WHICH\nMANAGEMENT\u0092S JUDGMENT IN SELECTING AMONG AVAILABLE ALTERNATIVES WOULD NOT PRODUCE A MATERIALLY DIFFERENT RESULT. OUR SENIOR MANAGEMENT HAS REVIEWED THE BELOW CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND RELATED DISCLOSURES WITH THE FINANCE AND AUDIT\nCOMMITTEE OF THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS.\nREVENUE RECOGNITION\nOUR SOURCES OF REVENUES INCLUDE: (1) SOFTWARE, WHICH INCLUDES NEW SOFTWARE LICENSE REVENUES EARNED FROM GRANTING LICENSES TO USE OUR SOFTWARE PRODUCTS AND FEES FROM CLOUD SOFTWARE SUBSCRIPTION\nOFFERINGS, AND SOFTWARE LICENSE UPDATES AND PRODUCT SUPPORT REVENUES; (2) HARDWARE SYSTEMS, WHICH INCLUDES THE SALE OF HARDWARE SYSTEMS PRODUCTS INCLUDING COMPUTER SERVERS AND STORAGE PRODUCTS, AND HARDWARE SYSTEMS SUPPORT REVENUES; AND\n(3) SERVICES, WHICH INCLUDES SOFTWARE AND HARDWARE RELATED SERVICES INCLUDING CONSULTING, MANAGED CLOUD SERVICES AND EDUCATION REVENUES. REVENUE GENERALLY IS RECOGNIZED NET OF ANY TAXES COLLECTED FROM CUSTOMERS AND SUBSEQUENTLY REMITTED TO\nGOVERNMENTAL AUTHORITIES.\n43\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nREVENUE RECOGNITION FOR SOFTWARE PRODUCTS AND SOFTWARE RELATED SERVICES (SOFTWARE ELEMENTS)\nNEW SOFTWARE LICENSE REVENUES PRIMARILY REPRESENT FEES EARNED FROM GRANTING CUSTOMERS LICENSES TO USE OUR DATABASE, MIDDLEWARE AND\nAPPLICATIONS SOFTWARE AND EXCLUDE REVENUES DERIVED FROM SOFTWARE LICENSE UPDATES, WHICH ARE INCLUDED IN SOFTWARE LICENSE UPDATES AND PRODUCT SUPPORT REVENUES. THE BASIS FOR OUR NEW SOFTWARE LICENSE REVENUE RECOGNITION IS SUBSTANTIALLY GOVERNED BY\nTHE ACCOUNTING GUIDANCE CONTAINED IN ASC 985-605,\nSOFTWARE-REVENUE RECOGNITION\n, WE EXERCISE JUDGMENT AND USE ESTIMATES IN CONNECTION WITH THE DETERMINATION OF THE AMOUNT OF SOFTWARE AND SERVICES REVENUES TO BE RECOGNIZED IN EACH ACCOUNTING\nPERIOD.\nFOR SOFTWARE LICENSE ARRANGEMENTS THAT DO NOT REQUIRE SIGNIFICANT MODIFICATION OR CUSTOMIZATION OF THE UNDERLYING SOFTWARE, WE\nRECOGNIZE NEW SOFTWARE LICENSE REVENUES WHEN: (1) WE ENTER INTO A LEGALLY BINDING ARRANGEMENT WITH A CUSTOMER FOR THE LICENSE OF SOFTWARE; (2) WE DELIVER THE PRODUCTS; (3) THE SALE PRICE IS FIXED OR DETERMINABLE AND FREE OF\nCONTINGENCIES OR SIGNIFICANT UNCERTAINTIES; AND (4) COLLECTION IS PROBABLE. REVENUES THAT ARE NOT RECOGNIZED AT THE TIME OF SALE BECAUSE THE FOREGOING CONDITIONS ARE NOT MET, ARE RECOGNIZED WHEN THOSE CONDITIONS ARE SUBSEQUENTLY MET.\nSUBSTANTIALLY ALL OF OUR SOFTWARE LICENSE ARRANGEMENTS DO NOT INCLUDE ACCEPTANCE PROVISIONS. HOWEVER, IF ACCEPTANCE PROVISIONS EXIST AS PART\nOF PUBLIC POLICY, FOR EXAMPLE, IN AGREEMENTS WITH GOVERNMENT ENTITIES WHERE ACCEPTANCE PERIODS ARE REQUIRED BY LAW, OR WITHIN PREVIOUSLY EXECUTED TERMS AND CONDITIONS THAT ARE REFERENCED IN THE CURRENT AGREEMENT AND ARE SHORT-TERM IN NATURE, WE\nGENERALLY RECOGNIZE REVENUES UPON DELIVERY PROVIDED THE ACCEPTANCE TERMS ARE PERFUNCTORY AND ALL OTHER REVENUE RECOGNITION CRITERIA HAVE BEEN MET. IF ACCEPTANCE PROVISIONS ARE NOT PERFUNCTORY (FOR EXAMPLE, ACCEPTANCE PROVISIONS THAT ARE LONG-TERM IN\nNATURE OR ARE NOT INCLUDED AS STANDARD TERMS OF AN ARRANGEMENT), REVENUES ARE RECOGNIZED UPON THE EARLIER OF RECEIPT OF WRITTEN CUSTOMER ACCEPTANCE OR EXPIRATION OF THE ACCEPTANCE PERIOD.\nTHE VAST MAJORITY OF OUR SOFTWARE LICENSE ARRANGEMENTS INCLUDE SOFTWARE LICENSE UPDATES AND PRODUCT SUPPORT CONTRACTS, WHICH ARE ENTERED INTO AT THE CUSTOMER\u0092S OPTION AND ARE RECOGNIZED RATABLY OVER\nTHE TERM OF THE ARRANGEMENT, TYPICALLY ONE YEAR. SOFTWARE LICENSE UPDATES PROVIDE CUSTOMERS WITH RIGHTS TO UNSPECIFIED SOFTWARE PRODUCT UPGRADES, MAINTENANCE RELEASES AND PATCHES RELEASED DURING THE TERM OF THE SUPPORT PERIOD. PRODUCT SUPPORT\nINCLUDES INTERNET ACCESS TO TECHNICAL CONTENT, AS WELL AS INTERNET AND TELEPHONE ACCESS TO TECHNICAL SUPPORT PERSONNEL. SOFTWARE LICENSE UPDATES AND PRODUCT SUPPORT CONTRACTS ARE GENERALLY PRICED AS A PERCENTAGE OF THE NET NEW SOFTWARE LICENSE FEES.\nSUBSTANTIALLY ALL OF OUR CUSTOMERS RENEW THEIR SOFTWARE LICENSE UPDATES AND PRODUCT SUPPORT CONTRACTS ANNUALLY.\nREVENUE RECOGNITION FOR\nMULTIPLE-ELEMENT ARRANGEMENTS\n\u0097\nSOFTWARE PRODUCTS AND SOFTWARE RELATED SERVICES (SOFTWARE ARRANGEMENTS)\nWE OFTEN ENTER INTO\nARRANGEMENTS WITH CUSTOMERS THAT PURCHASE BOTH SOFTWARE RELATED PRODUCTS AND SOFTWARE RELATED SERVICES FROM US AT THE SAME TIME, OR WITHIN CLOSE PROXIMITY OF ONE ANOTHER (REFERRED TO AS SOFTWARE RELATED MULTIPLE-ELEMENT ARRANGEMENTS). SUCH SOFTWARE\nRELATED MULTIPLE-ELEMENT ARRANGEMENTS INCLUDE THE SALE OF OUR SOFTWARE PRODUCTS, SOFTWARE LICENSE UPDATES AND PRODUCT SUPPORT CONTRACTS AND OTHER SOFTWARE RELATED SERVICES WHEREBY SOFTWARE LICENSE DELIVERY IS FOLLOWED BY THE SUBSEQUENT OR\nCONTEMPORANEOUS DELIVERY OF THE OTHER ELEMENTS. FOR THOSE SOFTWARE RELATED MULTIPLE-ELEMENT ARRANGEMENTS, WE HAVE APPLIED THE RESIDUAL METHOD TO DETERMINE THE AMOUNT OF SOFTWARE LICENSE REVENUES TO BE RECOGNIZED PURSUANT TO ASC 985-605. UNDER THE\nRESIDUAL METHOD, IF FAIR VALUE EXISTS FOR UNDELIVERED ELEMENTS IN A MULTIPLE-ELEMENT ARRANGEMENT, SUCH FAIR VALUE OF THE UNDELIVERED ELEMENTS IS DEFERRED WITH THE REMAINING PORTION OF THE ARRANGEMENT CONSIDERATION RECOGNIZED UPON DELIVERY OF THE\nSOFTWARE LICENSE OR SERVICES ARRANGEMENT. WE ALLOCATE THE FAIR VALUE OF EACH ELEMENT OF A SOFTWARE RELATED MULTIPLE-ELEMENT ARRANGEMENT BASED UPON ITS FAIR VALUE AS DETERMINED BY OUR VENDOR SPECIFIC OBJECTIVE EVIDENCE (VSOE\u0097DESCRIBED FURTHER\nBELOW), WITH ANY REMAINING AMOUNT ALLOCATED TO THE SOFTWARE LICENSE.\nREVENUE RECOGNITION FOR HARDWARE SYSTEMS PRODUCTS, HARDWARE SYSTEMS\nRELATED SERVICES AND CLOUD SOFTWARE SUBSCRIPTION OFFERINGS (NONSOFTWARE ELEMENTS)\nREVENUES FROM THE SALE OF HARDWARE SYSTEMS PRODUCTS\nREPRESENT AMOUNTS EARNED PRIMARILY FROM THE SALE OF COMPUTER SERVERS AND STORAGE PRODUCTS. OUR REVENUE RECOGNITION POLICY FOR THESE NONSOFTWARE DELIVERABLES AND\n44\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nOTHER NONSOFTWARE DELIVERABLES INCLUDING HARDWARE SYSTEMS RELATED SERVICES AND CLOUD SOFTWARE SUBSCRIPTION OFFERINGS IS BASED UPON THE ACCOUNTING GUIDANCE CONTAINED IN ASC 605,\nREVENUE\nRECOGNITION\n, AND WE EXERCISE JUDGMENT AND USE ESTIMATES IN CONNECTION WITH THE DETERMINATION OF THE AMOUNT OF HARDWARE SYSTEMS PRODUCTS, HARDWARE SYSTEMS RELATED SERVICES REVENUES AND CLOUD SOFTWARE SUBSCRIPTION REVENUES TO BE RECOGNIZED IN EACH\nACCOUNTING PERIOD.\nREVENUES FROM THE SALES OF OUR NONSOFTWARE ELEMENTS ARE RECOGNIZED WHEN: (1) PERSUASIVE EVIDENCE OF AN ARRANGEMENT\nEXISTS; (2) WE DELIVER THE PRODUCTS AND PASSAGE OF THE TITLE TO THE BUYER OCCURS; (3) THE SALE PRICE IS FIXED OR DETERMINABLE; AND (4) COLLECTION IS REASONABLY ASSURED. REVENUES THAT ARE NOT RECOGNIZED AT THE TIME OF SALE BECAUSE THE\nFOREGOING CONDITIONS ARE NOT MET ARE RECOGNIZED WHEN THOSE CONDITIONS ARE SUBSEQUENTLY MET. WHEN APPLICABLE, WE REDUCE REVENUES FOR ESTIMATED RETURNS OR CERTAIN OTHER INCENTIVE PROGRAMS WHERE WE HAVE THE ABILITY TO SUFFICIENTLY ESTIMATE THE EFFECTS\nOF THESE ITEMS. WHERE AN ARRANGEMENT IS SUBJECT TO ACCEPTANCE CRITERIA AND THE ACCEPTANCE PROVISIONS ARE NOT PERFUNCTORY (FOR EXAMPLE, ACCEPTANCE PROVISIONS THAT ARE LONG-TERM IN NATURE OR ARE NOT INCLUDED AS STANDARD TERMS OF AN ARRANGEMENT),\nREVENUES ARE RECOGNIZED UPON THE EARLIER OF RECEIPT OF WRITTEN CUSTOMER ACCEPTANCE OR EXPIRATION OF THE ACCEPTANCE PERIOD.\nOUR HARDWARE\nSYSTEMS SUPPORT OFFERINGS GENERALLY PROVIDE CUSTOMERS WITH SOFTWARE UPDATES FOR THE SOFTWARE COMPONENTS THAT ARE ESSENTIAL TO THE FUNCTIONALITY OF OUR SERVER AND STORAGE PRODUCTS AND CAN ALSO INCLUDE PRODUCT REPAIRS, MAINTENANCE SERVICES AND\nTECHNICAL SUPPORT SERVICES. HARDWARE SYSTEMS SUPPORT CONTRACTS ARE GENERALLY PRICED AS A PERCENTAGE OF THE NET HARDWARE SYSTEMS PRODUCTS FEES. HARDWARE SYSTEMS SUPPORT CONTRACTS ARE ENTERED INTO AT THE CUSTOMER\u0092S OPTION AND ARE RECOGNIZED\nRATABLY OVER THE CONTRACTUAL TERM OF THE ARRANGEMENTS, WHICH ARE TYPICALLY ONE YEAR.\nOUR CLOUD SOFTWARE SUBSCRIPTION OFFERINGS GENERALLY\nPROVIDE CUSTOMERS ACCESS TO CERTAIN OF OUR SOFTWARE WITHIN A CLOUD-BASED IT ENVIRONMENT THAT WE MANAGE AND OFFER TO CUSTOMERS ON A SUBSCRIPTION BASIS. REVENUES FOR OUR CLOUD SOFTWARE SUBSCRIPTION OFFERINGS ARE RECOGNIZED RATABLY OVER THE CONTRACT\nTERM COMMENCING WITH THE DATE OUR SERVICE IS MADE AVAILABLE TO CUSTOMERS AND ALL OTHER REVENUE RECOGNITION CRITERIA HAVE BEEN SATISFIED.\nREVENUE RECOGNITION FOR MULTIPLE-ELEMENT ARRANGEMENTS\n\u0097\nHARDWARE SYSTEMS PRODUCTS AND HARDWARE SYSTEMS RELATED SERVICES (NONSOFTWARE\nARRANGEMENTS)\nWE ENTER INTO ARRANGEMENTS WITH CUSTOMERS THAT PURCHASE BOTH NONSOFTWARE RELATED PRODUCTS AND SERVICES FROM US AT THE SAME\nTIME, OR WITHIN CLOSE PROXIMITY OF ONE ANOTHER (REFERRED TO AS NONSOFTWARE MULTIPLE-ELEMENT ARRANGEMENTS). EACH ELEMENT WITHIN A NONSOFTWARE MULTIPLE-ELEMENT ARRANGEMENT IS ACCOUNTED FOR AS A SEPARATE UNIT OF ACCOUNTING PROVIDED THE FOLLOWING\nCRITERIA ARE MET: THE DELIVERED PRODUCTS OR SERVICES HAVE VALUE TO THE CUSTOMER ON A STANDALONE BASIS; AND FOR AN ARRANGEMENT THAT INCLUDES A GENERAL RIGHT OF RETURN RELATIVE TO THE DELIVERED PRODUCTS OR SERVICES, DELIVERY OR PERFORMANCE OF THE\nUNDELIVERED PRODUCT OR SERVICE IS CONSIDERED PROBABLE AND IS SUBSTANTIALLY CONTROLLED BY US. WE CONSIDER A DELIVERABLE TO HAVE STANDALONE VALUE IF THE PRODUCT OR SERVICE IS SOLD SEPARATELY BY US OR ANOTHER VENDOR OR COULD BE RESOLD BY THE CUSTOMER.\nFURTHER, OUR REVENUE ARRANGEMENTS GENERALLY DO NOT INCLUDE A GENERAL RIGHT OF RETURN RELATIVE TO THE DELIVERED PRODUCTS. WHERE THE AFOREMENTIONED CRITERIA FOR A SEPARATE UNIT OF ACCOUNTING ARE NOT MET, THE DELIVERABLE IS COMBINED WITH THE\nUNDELIVERED ELEMENT(S) AND TREATED AS A SINGLE UNIT OF ACCOUNTING FOR THE PURPOSES OF ALLOCATION OF THE ARRANGEMENT CONSIDERATION AND REVENUE RECOGNITION. FOR THOSE UNITS OF ACCOUNTING THAT INCLUDE MORE THAN ONE DELIVERABLE BUT ARE TREATED AS A\nSINGLE UNIT OF ACCOUNTING, WE GENERALLY RECOGNIZE REVENUES OVER THE DELIVERY PERIOD. FOR THE PURPOSES OF REVENUE CLASSIFICATION OF THE ELEMENTS THAT ARE ACCOUNTED FOR AS A SINGLE UNIT OF ACCOUNTING, WE ALLOCATE REVENUE TO THE RESPECTIVE REVENUE LINE\nITEMS WITHIN OUR CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF OPERATIONS BASED ON A RATIONAL AND CONSISTENT METHODOLOGY UTILIZING OUR BEST ESTIMATE OF RELATIVE SELLING PRICES OF SUCH ELEMENTS.\nFOR OUR NONSOFTWARE MULTIPLE-ELEMENT ARRANGEMENTS, WE ALLOCATE REVENUE TO EACH ELEMENT BASED ON A SELLING PRICE HIERARCHY AT THE ARRANGEMENT\u0092S INCEPTION. THE SELLING PRICE FOR EACH ELEMENT IS BASED\nUPON THE FOLLOWING SELLING PRICE HIERARCHY: VSOE IF AVAILABLE, THIRD PARTY EVIDENCE (TPE) IF VSOE IS NOT AVAILABLE, OR ESTIMATED SELLING PRICE (ESP) IF NEITHER VSOE NOR TPE ARE AVAILABLE (A DESCRIPTION AS TO HOW WE DETERMINE VSOE, TPE AND ESP IS\nPROVIDED BELOW). IF A TANGIBLE HARDWARE SYSTEMS PRODUCT INCLUDES SOFTWARE, WE DETERMINE WHETHER THE TANGIBLE HARDWARE SYSTEMS PRODUCT AND THE SOFTWARE WORK TOGETHER TO DELIVER THE PRODUCT\u0092S ESSENTIAL FUNCTIONALITY AND, IF\n45\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nSO, THE ENTIRE PRODUCT IS TREATED AS A NONSOFTWARE DELIVERABLE. THE TOTAL ARRANGEMENT CONSIDERATION IS ALLOCATED TO EACH SEPARATE UNIT OF ACCOUNTING FOR EACH OF THE NONSOFTWARE DELIVERABLES USING\nTHE RELATIVE SELLING PRICES OF EACH UNIT BASED ON THE AFOREMENTIONED SELLING PRICE HIERARCHY. WE LIMIT THE AMOUNT OF REVENUE RECOGNIZED FOR DELIVERED ELEMENTS TO AN AMOUNT THAT IS NOT CONTINGENT UPON FUTURE DELIVERY OF ADDITIONAL PRODUCTS OR\nSERVICES OR MEETING OF ANY SPECIFIED PERFORMANCE CONDITIONS.\nWHEN POSSIBLE, WE ESTABLISH VSOE OF SELLING PRICE FOR DELIVERABLES IN NONSOFTWARE\nMULTIPLE-ELEMENT ARRANGEMENTS USING THE PRICE CHARGED FOR A DELIVERABLE WHEN SOLD SEPARATELY AND FOR SOFTWARE LICENSE UPDATES AND PRODUCT SUPPORT AND HARDWARE SYSTEMS SUPPORT, BASED ON THE RENEWAL RATES OFFERED TO CUSTOMERS. TPE IS ESTABLISHED BY\nEVALUATING SIMILAR AND INTERCHANGEABLE COMPETITOR PRODUCTS OR SERVICES IN STANDALONE ARRANGEMENTS WITH SIMILARLY SITUATED CUSTOMERS. IF WE ARE UNABLE TO DETERMINE THE SELLING PRICE BECAUSE VSOE OR TPE DOES NOT EXIST, WE DETERMINE ESP FOR THE\nPURPOSES OF ALLOCATING THE ARRANGEMENT BY REVIEWING HISTORICAL TRANSACTIONS, INCLUDING TRANSACTIONS WHEREBY THE DELIVERABLE WAS SOLD ON A STANDALONE BASIS AND CONSIDERING SEVERAL OTHER EXTERNAL AND INTERNAL FACTORS INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO,\nPRICING PRACTICES INCLUDING DISCOUNTING, MARGIN OBJECTIVES, COMPETITION, THE GEOGRAPHIES IN WHICH WE OFFER OUR PRODUCTS AND SERVICES, THE TYPE OF CUSTOMER (I.E. DISTRIBUTOR, VALUE ADDED RESELLER, GOVERNMENT AGENCY AND DIRECT END USER, AMONG OTHERS)\nAND THE STAGE OF THE PRODUCT LIFECYCLE. THE DETERMINATION OF ESP IS MADE THROUGH CONSULTATION WITH AND APPROVAL BY OUR MANAGEMENT, TAKING INTO CONSIDERATION OUR PRICING MODEL AND GO-TO-MARKET STRATEGY. AS OUR, OR OUR COMPETITORS\u0092, PRICING AND\nGO-TO-MARKET STRATEGIES EVOLVE, WE MAY MODIFY OUR PRICING PRACTICES IN THE FUTURE, WHICH COULD RESULT IN CHANGES TO OUR DETERMINATION OF VSOE, TPE AND ESP. AS A RESULT, OUR FUTURE REVENUE RECOGNITION FOR MULTIPLE-ELEMENT ARRANGEMENTS COULD DIFFER\nMATERIALLY FROM OUR RESULTS IN THE CURRENT PERIOD. SELLING PRICES ARE ANALYZED ON AN ANNUAL BASIS OR MORE FREQUENTLY IF WE EXPERIENCE SIGNIFICANT CHANGES IN OUR SELLING PRICES.\nREVENUE RECOGNITION POLICIES APPLICABLE TO BOTH SOFTWARE AND NONSOFTWARE ELEMENTS\nREVENUE RECOGNITION FOR MULTIPLE-ELEMENT ARRANGEMENTS\u0097ARRANGEMENTS WITH SOFTWARE AND NONSOFTWARE ELEMENTS\nWE ALSO ENTER INTO MULTIPLE-ELEMENT ARRANGEMENTS THAT MAY INCLUDE A COMBINATION OF OUR VARIOUS SOFTWARE RELATED AND NONSOFTWARE RELATED PRODUCTS AND\nSERVICES OFFERINGS INCLUDING HARDWARE SYSTEMS PRODUCTS, HARDWARE SYSTEMS SUPPORT, NEW SOFTWARE LICENSES, SOFTWARE LICENSE UPDATES AND PRODUCT SUPPORT, CLOUD SOFTWARE SUBSCRIPTION, CONSULTING, MANAGED CLOUD SERVICES AND EDUCATION. IN SUCH\nARRANGEMENTS, WE FIRST ALLOCATE THE TOTAL ARRANGEMENT CONSIDERATION BASED ON THE RELATIVE SELLING PRICES OF THE SOFTWARE GROUP OF ELEMENTS AS A WHOLE AND TO THE NONSOFTWARE ELEMENTS. WE THEN FURTHER ALLOCATE CONSIDERATION WITHIN THE SOFTWARE GROUP\nTO THE RESPECTIVE ELEMENTS WITHIN THAT GROUP FOLLOWING THE GUIDANCE IN ASC 985-605 AND OUR POLICIES AS DESCRIBED ABOVE. AFTER THE ARRANGEMENT CONSIDERATION HAS BEEN ALLOCATED TO THE ELEMENTS, WE ACCOUNT FOR EACH RESPECTIVE ELEMENT IN THE ARRANGEMENT\nAS DESCRIBED ABOVE.\nOTHER REVENUE RECOGNITION POLICIES APPLICABLE TO SOFTWARE AND NONSOFTWARE ELEMENTS\nMANY OF OUR SOFTWARE ARRANGEMENTS INCLUDE CONSULTING IMPLEMENTATION SERVICES SOLD SEPARATELY UNDER CONSULTING ENGAGEMENT CONTRACTS AND ARE INCLUDED AS A\nPART OF OUR SERVICES BUSINESS. CONSULTING REVENUES FROM THESE ARRANGEMENTS ARE GENERALLY ACCOUNTED FOR SEPARATELY FROM NEW SOFTWARE LICENSE REVENUES BECAUSE THE ARRANGEMENTS QUALIFY AS SERVICES TRANSACTIONS AS DEFINED IN ASC 985-605. THE MORE\nSIGNIFICANT FACTORS CONSIDERED IN DETERMINING WHETHER THE REVENUES SHOULD BE ACCOUNTED FOR SEPARATELY INCLUDE THE NATURE OF SERVICES (I.E. CONSIDERATION OF WHETHER THE SERVICES ARE ESSENTIAL TO THE FUNCTIONALITY OF THE LICENSED PRODUCT), DEGREE OF\nRISK, AVAILABILITY OF SERVICES FROM OTHER VENDORS, TIMING OF PAYMENTS AND IMPACT OF MILESTONES OR ACCEPTANCE CRITERIA ON THE REALIZABILITY OF THE SOFTWARE LICENSE FEE. REVENUES FOR CONSULTING SERVICES ARE GENERALLY RECOGNIZED AS THE SERVICES ARE\nPERFORMED. IF THERE IS A SIGNIFICANT UNCERTAINTY ABOUT THE PROJECT COMPLETION OR RECEIPT OF PAYMENT FOR THE CONSULTING SERVICES, REVENUES ARE DEFERRED UNTIL THE UNCERTAINTY IS SUFFICIENTLY RESOLVED. WE ESTIMATE THE PROPORTIONAL PERFORMANCE ON\nCONTRACTS WITH FIXED OR \u0093NOT TO EXCEED\u0094 FEES ON A MONTHLY BASIS UTILIZING HOURS INCURRED TO DATE AS A PERCENTAGE OF TOTAL ESTIMATED HOURS TO COMPLETE THE PROJECT. IF WE DO NOT HAVE A SUFFICIENT BASIS TO MEASURE PROGRESS TOWARDS COMPLETION,\nREVENUES ARE RECOGNIZED WHEN WE RECEIVE FINAL ACCEPTANCE FROM THE CUSTOMER THAT THE SERVICES HAVE BEEN COMPLETED. WHEN TOTAL COST ESTIMATES EXCEED REVENUES, WE ACCRUE FOR THE ESTIMATED LOSSES IMMEDIATELY USING COST ESTIMATES THAT ARE BASED UPON AN\nAVERAGE FULLY\n46\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nBURDENED DAILY RATE APPLICABLE TO THE CONSULTING ORGANIZATION DELIVERING THE SERVICES. THE COMPLEXITY OF THE ESTIMATION PROCESS AND FACTORS RELATING TO THE ASSUMPTIONS, RISKS AND UNCERTAINTIES\nINHERENT WITH THE APPLICATION OF THE PROPORTIONAL PERFORMANCE METHOD OF ACCOUNTING AFFECTS THE AMOUNTS OF REVENUES AND RELATED EXPENSES REPORTED IN OUR CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS. A NUMBER OF INTERNAL AND EXTERNAL FACTORS CAN AFFECT OUR\nESTIMATES, INCLUDING LABOR RATES, UTILIZATION AND EFFICIENCY VARIANCES AND SPECIFICATION AND TESTING REQUIREMENT CHANGES.\nOUR MANAGED CLOUD\nSERVICES ARE OFFERED AS STANDALONE ARRANGEMENTS OR AS A PART OF ARRANGEMENTS TO CUSTOMERS BUYING NEW SOFTWARE LICENSES OR HARDWARE SYSTEMS PRODUCTS AND SERVICES. ORACLE MANAGED CLOUD SERVICES ARE DESIGNED TO PROVIDE COMPREHENSIVE SOFTWARE AND\nHARDWARE MANAGEMENT AND MAINTENANCE SERVICES FOR CUSTOMERS HOSTED AT OUR ORACLE DATA CENTER FACILITIES, SELECT PARTNER DATA CENTERS OR PHYSICALLY ON-PREMISE AT CUSTOMER FACILITIES. ADDITIONALLY, WE PROVIDE SUPPORT SERVICES, BOTH ON-PREMISE AND\nREMOTE, TO ORACLE CUSTOMERS TO ENABLE INCREASED PERFORMANCE AND HIGHER AVAILABILITY OF THEIR PRODUCTS AND SERVICES. DEPENDING UPON THE NATURE OF THE ARRANGEMENT, REVENUES FROM MANAGED CLOUD SERVICES ARE RECOGNIZED AS SERVICES ARE PERFORMED OR\nRATABLY OVER THE TERM OF THE SERVICE PERIOD, WHICH IS GENERALLY ONE YEAR OR LESS.\nEDUCATION REVENUES ARE ALSO A PART OF OUR SERVICES BUSINESS\nAND INCLUDE INSTRUCTOR-LED, MEDIA-BASED AND INTERNET-BASED TRAINING IN THE USE OF OUR SOFTWARE AND HARDWARE PRODUCTS. EDUCATION REVENUES ARE RECOGNIZED AS THE CLASSES OR OTHER EDUCATION OFFERINGS ARE DELIVERED.\nIF AN ARRANGEMENT CONTAINS MULTIPLE ELEMENTS AND DOES NOT QUALIFY FOR SEPARATE ACCOUNTING FOR THE PRODUCT AND SERVICE TRANSACTIONS, THEN NEW SOFTWARE\nLICENSE REVENUES AND\/OR HARDWARE SYSTEMS PRODUCTS REVENUES, INCLUDING THE COSTS OF HARDWARE SYSTEMS PRODUCTS, ARE GENERALLY RECOGNIZED TOGETHER WITH THE SERVICES BASED ON CONTRACT ACCOUNTING USING EITHER THE PERCENTAGE-OF-COMPLETION OR\nCOMPLETED-CONTRACT METHOD. CONTRACT ACCOUNTING IS APPLIED TO ANY BUNDLED SOFTWARE, HARDWARE SYSTEMS AND SERVICES ARRANGEMENTS: (1) THAT INCLUDE MILESTONES OR CUSTOMER SPECIFIC ACCEPTANCE CRITERIA THAT MAY AFFECT COLLECTION OF THE SOFTWARE\nLICENSE OR HARDWARE SYSTEMS PRODUCT FEES; (2) WHERE CONSULTING SERVICES INCLUDE SIGNIFICANT MODIFICATION OR CUSTOMIZATION OF THE SOFTWARE OR HARDWARE SYSTEMS PRODUCT OR ARE OF A SPECIALIZED NATURE AND GENERALLY PERFORMED ONLY BY ORACLE;\n(3) WHERE SIGNIFICANT CONSULTING SERVICES ARE PROVIDED FOR IN THE SOFTWARE LICENSE CONTRACT OR HARDWARE SYSTEMS PRODUCT CONTRACT WITHOUT ADDITIONAL CHARGE OR ARE SUBSTANTIALLY DISCOUNTED; OR (4) WHERE THE SOFTWARE LICENSE OR HARDWARE\nSYSTEMS PRODUCT PAYMENT IS TIED TO THE PERFORMANCE OF CONSULTING SERVICES. FOR THE PURPOSES OF REVENUE CLASSIFICATION OF THE ELEMENTS THAT ARE ACCOUNTED FOR AS A SINGLE UNIT OF ACCOUNTING, WE ALLOCATE REVENUES TO SOFTWARE AND NONSOFTWARE ELEMENTS\nBASED ON A RATIONAL AND CONSISTENT METHODOLOGY UTILIZING OUR BEST ESTIMATE OF THE RELATIVE SELLING PRICE OF SUCH ELEMENTS.\nWE ALSO EVALUATE\nARRANGEMENTS WITH GOVERNMENTAL ENTITIES CONTAINING \u0093FISCAL FUNDING\u0094 OR \u0093TERMINATION FOR CONVENIENCE\u0094 PROVISIONS, WHEN SUCH PROVISIONS ARE REQUIRED BY LAW, TO DETERMINE THE PROBABILITY OF POSSIBLE CANCELLATION. WE CONSIDER\nMULTIPLE FACTORS, INCLUDING THE HISTORY WITH THE CUSTOMER IN SIMILAR TRANSACTIONS, THE \u0093ESSENTIAL USE\u0094 OF THE SOFTWARE OR HARDWARE SYSTEMS PRODUCTS AND THE PLANNING, BUDGETING AND APPROVAL PROCESSES UNDERTAKEN BY THE GOVERNMENTAL ENTITY.\nIF WE DETERMINE UPON EXECUTION OF THESE ARRANGEMENTS THAT THE LIKELIHOOD OF CANCELLATION IS REMOTE, WE THEN RECOGNIZE REVENUES ONCE ALL OF THE CRITERIA DESCRIBED ABOVE HAVE BEEN MET. IF SUCH A DETERMINATION CANNOT BE MADE, REVENUES ARE RECOGNIZED\nUPON THE EARLIER OF CASH RECEIPT OR APPROVAL OF THE APPLICABLE FUNDING PROVISION BY THE GOVERNMENTAL ENTITY.\nWE ASSESS WHETHER FEES ARE FIXED\nOR DETERMINABLE AT THE TIME OF SALE AND RECOGNIZE REVENUES IF ALL OTHER REVENUE RECOGNITION REQUIREMENTS ARE MET. OUR STANDARD PAYMENT TERMS ARE NET 30 DAYS. HOWEVER, PAYMENT TERMS MAY VARY BASED ON THE COUNTRY IN WHICH THE AGREEMENT IS EXECUTED.\nPAYMENTS THAT ARE DUE WITHIN SIX MONTHS ARE GENERALLY DEEMED TO BE FIXED OR DETERMINABLE BASED ON OUR SUCCESSFUL COLLECTION HISTORY ON SUCH ARRANGEMENTS, AND THEREBY SATISFY THE REQUIRED CRITERIA FOR REVENUE RECOGNITION.\nWHILE MOST OF OUR ARRANGEMENTS FOR SALES WITHIN OUR BUSINESSES INCLUDE SHORT-TERM PAYMENT TERMS, WE HAVE A STANDARD PRACTICE OF PROVIDING LONG-TERM\nFINANCING TO CREDITWORTHY CUSTOMERS THROUGH OUR FINANCING DIVISION. SINCE FISCAL 1989, WHEN OUR FINANCING DIVISION WAS FORMED, WE HAVE ESTABLISHED A HISTORY OF COLLECTION, WITHOUT CONCESSIONS, ON THESE RECEIVABLES WITH PAYMENT TERMS THAT GENERALLY\nEXTEND UP TO FIVE YEARS FROM THE CONTRACT DATE. PROVIDED ALL OTHER REVENUE RECOGNITION CRITERIA HAVE BEEN MET, WE RECOGNIZE NEW SOFTWARE LICENSE REVENUES AND HARDWARE SYSTEMS PRODUCTS REVENUES FOR THESE ARRANGEMENTS UPON DELIVERY, NET OF ANY PAYMENT\nDISCOUNTS\n47\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nFROM FINANCING TRANSACTIONS. WE HAVE GENERALLY SOLD RECEIVABLES FINANCED THROUGH OUR FINANCING DIVISION ON A NON-RECOURSE BASIS TO THIRD PARTY FINANCING INSTITUTIONS WITHIN 90 DAYS OF THE\nCONTRACTS\u0092 DATES OF EXECUTION AND WE CLASSIFY THE PROCEEDS FROM THESE SALES AS CASH FLOWS FROM OPERATING ACTIVITIES IN OUR CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF CASH FLOWS. WE ACCOUNT FOR THE SALES OF THESE RECEIVABLES AS \u0093TRUE SALES\u0094 AS DEFINED\nIN ASC 860,\nTRANSFERS AND SERVICING\n, AS WE ARE CONSIDERED TO HAVE SURRENDERED CONTROL OF THESE FINANCING RECEIVABLES.\nIN ADDITION, WE\nENTER INTO ARRANGEMENTS WITH LEASING COMPANIES FOR THE SALE OF OUR HARDWARE SYSTEMS PRODUCTS. THESE LEASING COMPANIES, IN TURN, LEASE OUR PRODUCTS TO END-USERS. THE LEASING COMPANIES GENERALLY HAVE NO RECOURSE TO US IN THE EVENT OF DEFAULT BY THE\nEND-USER AND WE RECOGNIZE REVENUE UPON DELIVERY, IF ALL THE OTHER REVENUE RECOGNITION CRITERIA HAVE BEEN MET.\nOUR CUSTOMERS INCLUDE SEVERAL OF\nOUR SUPPLIERS AND OCCASIONALLY, WE HAVE PURCHASED GOODS OR SERVICES FOR OUR OPERATIONS FROM THESE VENDORS AT OR ABOUT THE SAME TIME THAT WE HAVE SOLD OUR PRODUCTS TO THESE SAME COMPANIES (CONCURRENT TRANSACTIONS). SOFTWARE LICENSE AGREEMENTS OR\nSALES OF HARDWARE SYSTEMS THAT OCCUR WITHIN A THREE-MONTH TIME PERIOD FROM THE DATE WE HAVE PURCHASED GOODS OR SERVICES FROM THAT SAME CUSTOMER ARE REVIEWED FOR APPROPRIATE ACCOUNTING TREATMENT AND DISCLOSURE. WHEN WE ACQUIRE GOODS OR SERVICES FROM\nA CUSTOMER, WE NEGOTIATE THE PURCHASE SEPARATELY FROM ANY SALES TRANSACTION, AT TERMS WE CONSIDER TO BE AT ARM\u0092S LENGTH AND SETTLE THE PURCHASE IN CASH. WE RECOGNIZE NEW SOFTWARE LICENSE REVENUES OR HARDWARE SYSTEMS PRODUCT REVENUES FROM\nCONCURRENT TRANSACTIONS IF ALL OF OUR REVENUE RECOGNITION CRITERIA ARE MET AND THE GOODS AND SERVICES ACQUIRED ARE NECESSARY FOR OUR CURRENT OPERATIONS.\nBUSINESS COMBINATIONS\nWE APPLY THE PROVISIONS OF ASC 805,\nBUSINESS\nCOMBINATIONS\n, IN THE ACCOUNTING FOR OUR ACQUISITIONS. IT REQUIRES US TO RECOGNIZE SEPARATELY FROM GOODWILL THE ASSETS ACQUIRED AND THE LIABILITIES ASSUMED AT THEIR ACQUISITION DATE FAIR VALUES. GOODWILL AS OF THE ACQUISITION DATE IS MEASURED AS\nTHE EXCESS OF CONSIDERATION TRANSFERRED AND THE NET OF THE ACQUISITION DATE FAIR VALUES OF THE ASSETS ACQUIRED AND THE LIABILITIES ASSUMED. WHILE WE USE OUR BEST ESTIMATES AND ASSUMPTIONS TO ACCURATELY VALUE ASSETS ACQUIRED AND LIABILITIES ASSUMED\nAT THE ACQUISITION DATE, OUR ESTIMATES ARE INHERENTLY UNCERTAIN AND SUBJECT TO REFINEMENT. AS A RESULT, DURING THE MEASUREMENT PERIOD, WHICH MAY BE UP TO ONE YEAR FROM THE ACQUISITION DATE, WE RECORD ADJUSTMENTS TO THE ASSETS ACQUIRED AND\nLIABILITIES ASSUMED WITH THE CORRESPONDING OFFSET TO GOODWILL. UPON THE CONCLUSION OF THE MEASUREMENT PERIOD OR FINAL DETERMINATION OF THE VALUES OF ASSETS ACQUIRED OR LIABILITIES ASSUMED, WHICHEVER COMES FIRST, ANY SUBSEQUENT ADJUSTMENTS ARE\nRECORDED TO OUR CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF OPERATIONS.\nACCOUNTING FOR BUSINESS COMBINATIONS REQUIRES OUR MANAGEMENT TO MAKE SIGNIFICANT\nESTIMATES AND ASSUMPTIONS, ESPECIALLY AT THE ACQUISITION DATE INCLUDING OUR ESTIMATES FOR INTANGIBLE ASSETS, CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS ASSUMED, RESTRUCTURING LIABILITIES, PRE-ACQUISITION CONTINGENCIES AND CONTINGENT CONSIDERATION, WHERE APPLICABLE.\nALTHOUGH WE BELIEVE THE ASSUMPTIONS AND ESTIMATES WE HAVE MADE IN THE PAST HAVE BEEN REASONABLE AND APPROPRIATE, THEY ARE BASED IN PART ON HISTORICAL EXPERIENCE AND INFORMATION OBTAINED FROM THE MANAGEMENT OF THE ACQUIRED COMPANIES AND ARE\nINHERENTLY UNCERTAIN.\nEXAMPLES OF CRITICAL ESTIMATES IN VALUING CERTAIN OF THE INTANGIBLE ASSETS WE HAVE ACQUIRED INCLUDE BUT ARE NOT LIMITED\nTO.\n\u0095\nFUTURE EXPECTED CASH FLOWS FROM SOFTWARE LICENSE SALES, HARDWARE SYSTEMS PRODUCT SALES, SUPPORT AGREEMENTS, CONSULTING CONTRACTS, OTHER CUSTOMER\nCONTRACTS, ACQUIRED DEVELOPED TECHNOLOGIES AND PATENTS;\n\u0095\nEXPECTED COSTS TO DEVELOP THE IN-PROCESS RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT INTO COMMERCIALLY VIABLE PRODUCTS AND ESTIMATED CASH FLOWS FROM THE PROJECTS WHEN\nCOMPLETED;\n\u0095\nTHE ACQUIRED COMPANY\u0092S BRAND AND COMPETITIVE POSITION, AS WELL AS ASSUMPTIONS ABOUT THE PERIOD OF TIME THE ACQUIRED BRAND WILL CONTINUE TO BE USED\nIN THE COMBINED COMPANY\u0092S PRODUCT PORTFOLIO; AND\n\u0095\nDISCOUNT RATES.\nUNANTICIPATED EVENTS AND CIRCUMSTANCES MAY OCCUR THAT MAY AFFECT THE ACCURACY OR VALIDITY OF SUCH ASSUMPTIONS, ESTIMATES OR ACTUAL RESULTS.\n48\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nWE ESTIMATE THE FAIR VALUES OF CLOUD SOFTWARE SUBSCRIPTION, SOFTWARE LICENSE UPDATES AND PRODUCT SUPPORT AND\nHARDWARE SYSTEMS SUPPORT OBLIGATIONS ASSUMED. THE ESTIMATED FAIR VALUES OF THESE PERFORMANCE OBLIGATIONS ARE DETERMINED UTILIZING A COST BUILD-UP APPROACH. THE COST BUILD-UP APPROACH DETERMINES FAIR VALUE BY ESTIMATING THE COSTS RELATED TO\nFULFILLING THE OBLIGATIONS PLUS A NORMAL PROFIT MARGIN. THE ESTIMATED COSTS TO FULFILL THE OBLIGATIONS ARE BASED ON THE HISTORICAL DIRECT COSTS RELATED TO PROVIDING THE SERVICES INCLUDING THE CORRECTION OF ANY ERRORS IN THE PRODUCTS ACQUIRED. THE\nSUM OF THESE COSTS AND OPERATING PROFIT APPROXIMATES, IN THEORY, THE AMOUNT THAT WE WOULD BE REQUIRED TO PAY A THIRD PARTY TO ASSUME THE PERFORMANCE OBLIGATIONS. WE DO NOT INCLUDE ANY COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH SELLING EFFORTS OR RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT\nOR THE RELATED FULFILLMENT MARGINS ON THESE COSTS. PROFIT ASSOCIATED WITH ANY SELLING EFFORTS IS EXCLUDED BECAUSE THE ACQUIRED ENTITIES WOULD HAVE CONCLUDED THOSE SELLING EFFORTS ON THE PERFORMANCE OBLIGATIONS PRIOR TO THE ACQUISITION DATE. WE ALSO\nDO NOT INCLUDE THE ESTIMATED RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT COSTS IN OUR FAIR VALUE DETERMINATIONS, AS THESE COSTS ARE NOT DEEMED TO REPRESENT A LEGAL OBLIGATION AT THE TIME OF ACQUISITION. AS A RESULT, WE DID NOT RECOGNIZE NEW SOFTWARE LICENSES REVENUES\nRELATED TO CLOUD SOFTWARE SUBSCRIPTION CONTRACTS IN THE AMOUNT OF $22 MILLION THAT WOULD HAVE BEEN OTHERWISE RECORDED BY THE ACQUIRED BUSINESSES AS INDEPENDENT ENTITIES IN FISCAL 2012. WE DID NOT RECOGNIZE SOFTWARE LICENSE UPDATES AND PRODUCT\nSUPPORT REVENUES RELATED TO SUPPORT CONTRACTS IN THE AMOUNTS OF $48 MILLION, $80 MILLION AND $86 MILLION THAT WOULD HAVE BEEN OTHERWISE RECORDED BY THE ACQUIRED BUSINESSES AS INDEPENDENT ENTITIES IN FISCAL 2012, 2011 AND 2010, RESPECTIVELY. IN\nADDITION, WE DID NOT RECOGNIZE HARDWARE SYSTEMS SUPPORT REVENUES RELATED TO HARDWARE SYSTEMS SUPPORT CONTRACTS THAT WOULD HAVE OTHERWISE BEEN RECORDED BY THE ACQUIRED BUSINESSES AS INDEPENDENT ENTITIES IN THE AMOUNTS OF $30 MILLION, $148 MILLION AND\n$128 MILLION FOR FISCAL 2012, 2011 AND 2010, RESPECTIVELY. HISTORICALLY, SUBSTANTIALLY ALL OF OUR CUSTOMERS, INCLUDING CUSTOMERS FROM ACQUIRED COMPANIES, RENEW THEIR SOFTWARE LICENSE UPDATES AND PRODUCT SUPPORT CONTRACTS WHEN THE CONTRACTS ARE\nELIGIBLE FOR RENEWAL AND WE STRIVE TO RENEW CLOUD SOFTWARE SUBSCRIPTION AND HARDWARE SYSTEMS SUPPORT CONTRACTS. TO THE EXTENT CLOUD SOFTWARE SUBSCRIPTION, SOFTWARE SUPPORT OR HARDWARE SYSTEMS SUPPORT CONTRACTS ARE RENEWED, WE WILL RECOGNIZE THE\nREVENUES FOR THE FULL VALUES OF THE CONTRACTS OVER THE CONTRACTS\u0092 PERIODS, WHICH ARE GENERALLY ONE YEAR IN DURATION.\nIN CONNECTION WITH A\nBUSINESS COMBINATION, WE ESTIMATE COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH RESTRUCTURING PLANS COMMITTED TO BY OUR MANAGEMENT. RESTRUCTURING COSTS ARE TYPICALLY COMPRISED OF EMPLOYEE SEVERANCE COSTS, COSTS OF CONSOLIDATING DUPLICATE FACILITIES AND CONTRACT TERMINATION\nCOSTS. RESTRUCTURING EXPENSES ARE BASED UPON PLANS THAT HAVE BEEN COMMITTED TO BY OUR MANAGEMENT, BUT MAY BE REFINED IN SUBSEQUENT PERIODS. WE ACCOUNT FOR COSTS TO EXIT OR RESTRUCTURE CERTAIN ACTIVITIES OF AN ACQUIRED COMPANY SEPARATELY FROM THE\nBUSINESS COMBINATION. THESE COSTS ARE ACCOUNTED FOR AS ONE-TIME TERMINATION AND EXIT COSTS PURSUANT TO ASC 420,\nEXIT OR DISPOSAL COST OBLIGATIONS\n. A LIABILITY FOR A COST ASSOCIATED WITH AN EXIT OR DISPOSAL ACTIVITY IS RECOGNIZED AND MEASURED\nAT ITS FAIR VALUE IN OUR CONSOLIDATED STATEMENT OF OPERATIONS IN THE PERIOD IN WHICH THE LIABILITY IS INCURRED. WHEN ESTIMATING THE FAIR VALUE OF FACILITY RESTRUCTURING ACTIVITIES, ASSUMPTIONS ARE APPLIED REGARDING ESTIMATED SUB-LEASE PAYMENTS TO BE\nRECEIVED, WHICH CAN DIFFER MATERIALLY FROM ACTUAL RESULTS. THIS MAY REQUIRE US TO REVISE OUR INITIAL ESTIMATES WHICH MAY MATERIALLY AFFECT OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL POSITION IN THE PERIOD THE REVISION IS MADE.\nFOR A GIVEN ACQUISITION, WE MAY IDENTIFY CERTAIN PRE-ACQUISITION CONTINGENCIES AS OF THE ACQUISITION DATE AND MAY EXTEND OUR REVIEW AND EVALUATION OF\nTHESE PRE-ACQUISITION CONTINGENCIES THROUGHOUT THE MEASUREMENT PERIOD IN ORDER TO OBTAIN SUFFICIENT INFORMATION TO ASSESS WHETHER WE INCLUDE THESE CONTINGENCIES AS A PART OF THE FAIR VALUE ESTIMATES OF ASSETS ACQUIRED AND LIABILITIES ASSUMED AND, IF\nSO, TO DETERMINE THEIR ESTIMATED AMOUNTS.\nIF WE CANNOT REASONABLY DETERMINE THE FAIR VALUE OF A PRE-ACQUISITION CONTINGENCY (NON-INCOME TAX\nRELATED) BY THE END OF THE MEASUREMENT PERIOD, WHICH IS GENERALLY THE CASE GIVEN THE NATURE OF SUCH MATTERS, WE WILL RECOGNIZE AN ASSET OR A LIABILITY FOR SUCH PRE-ACQUISITION CONTINGENCY IF: (I) IT IS PROBABLE THAT AN ASSET EXISTED OR A\nLIABILITY HAD BEEN INCURRED AT THE ACQUISITION DATE AND (II) THE AMOUNT OF THE ASSET OR LIABILITY CAN BE REASONABLY ESTIMATED. SUBSEQUENT TO THE MEASUREMENT PERIOD, CHANGES IN OUR ESTIMATES OF SUCH CONTINGENCIES WILL AFFECT EARNINGS AND COULD\nHAVE A MATERIAL EFFECT ON OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL POSITION.\nIN ADDITION, UNCERTAIN TAX POSITIONS AND TAX RELATED VALUATION\nALLOWANCES ASSUMED IN CONNECTION WITH A BUSINESS COMBINATION ARE INITIALLY ESTIMATED AS OF THE ACQUISITION DATE. WE REEVALUATE THESE ITEMS QUARTERLY BASED UPON FACTS AND CIRCUMSTANCES THAT EXISTED AS OF THE ACQUISITION DATE WITH ANY ADJUSTMENTS TO\nOUR PRELIMINARY ESTIMATES BEING RECORDED TO GOODWILL PROVIDED THAT WE ARE WITHIN THE MEASUREMENT PERIOD. SUBSEQUENT TO THE MEASUREMENT PERIOD OR OUR FINAL DETERMINATION OF THE TAX ALLOWANCE\u0092S OR CONTINGENCY\u0092S ESTIMATED VALUE, WHICHEVER\nCOMES FIRST,\n49\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nCHANGES TO THESE UNCERTAIN TAX POSITIONS AND TAX RELATED VALUATION ALLOWANCES WILL AFFECT OUR PROVISION FOR INCOME TAXES IN OUR CONSOLIDATED STATEMENT OF OPERATIONS AND COULD HAVE A MATERIAL\nIMPACT ON OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL POSITION.\nGOODWILL AND INTANGIBLE ASSETS\u0097IMPAIRMENT ASSESSMENTS\nWE REVIEW GOODWILL FOR IMPAIRMENT ANNUALLY AND WHENEVER EVENTS OR CHANGES IN CIRCUMSTANCES INDICATE ITS CARRYING VALUE MAY NOT BE\nRECOVERABLE IN ACCORDANCE WITH ASC 350,\nINTANGIBLES\u0097GOODWILL AND OTHER\n. EFFECTIVE FISCAL 2012, WE OPTED TO PERFORM A QUALITATIVE ASSESSMENT TO TEST A REPORTING UNIT\u0092S GOODWILL FOR IMPAIRMENT. BASED ON OUR QUALITATIVE ASSESSMENT, IF\nWE DETERMINE THAT THE FAIR VALUE OF A REPORTING UNIT IS MORE LIKELY THAN NOT (I.E., A LIKELIHOOD OF MORE THAN 50 PERCENT) TO BE LESS THAN ITS CARRYING AMOUNT, THE TWO STEP IMPAIRMENT TEST WILL BE PERFORMED. IN THE FIRST STEP, WE COMPARE THE FAIR\nVALUE OF EACH REPORTING UNIT TO ITS CARRYING VALUE. IF THE FAIR VALUE OF THE REPORTING UNIT EXCEEDS THE CARRYING VALUE OF THE NET ASSETS ASSIGNED TO THAT UNIT, GOODWILL IS NOT CONSIDERED IMPAIRED AND WE ARE NOT REQUIRED TO PERFORM FURTHER TESTING.\nIF THE CARRYING VALUE OF THE NET ASSETS ASSIGNED TO THE REPORTING UNIT EXCEEDS THE FAIR VALUE OF THE REPORTING UNIT, THEN WE MUST PERFORM THE SECOND STEP OF THE IMPAIRMENT TEST IN ORDER TO DETERMINE THE IMPLIED FAIR VALUE OF THE REPORTING\nUNIT\u0092S GOODWILL. IF THE CARRYING VALUE OF A REPORTING UNIT\u0092S GOODWILL EXCEEDS ITS IMPLIED FAIR VALUE, THEN WE WOULD RECORD AN IMPAIRMENT LOSS EQUAL TO THE DIFFERENCE. OUR REPORTING UNITS ARE CONSISTENT WITH OUR OPERATING SEGMENTS\nIDENTIFIED IN NOTE 16 OF NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS INCLUDED ELSEWHERE IN THIS ANNUAL REPORT.\nDETERMINING THE FAIR VALUE OF A\nREPORTING UNIT INVOLVES THE USE OF SIGNIFICANT ESTIMATES AND ASSUMPTIONS. THESE ESTIMATES AND ASSUMPTIONS INCLUDE REVENUE GROWTH RATES AND OPERATING MARGINS USED TO CALCULATE PROJECTED FUTURE CASH FLOWS, RISK-ADJUSTED DISCOUNT RATES, FUTURE ECONOMIC\nAND MARKET CONDITIONS AND DETERMINATION OF APPROPRIATE MARKET COMPARABLES. WE BASE OUR FAIR VALUE ESTIMATES ON ASSUMPTIONS WE BELIEVE TO BE REASONABLE BUT THAT ARE UNPREDICTABLE AND INHERENTLY UNCERTAIN. ACTUAL FUTURE RESULTS MAY DIFFER FROM THOSE\nESTIMATES. IN ADDITION, WE MAKE CERTAIN JUDGMENTS AND ASSUMPTIONS IN ALLOCATING SHARED ASSETS AND LIABILITIES TO DETERMINE THE CARRYING VALUES FOR EACH OF OUR REPORTING UNITS. OUR MOST RECENT ANNUAL GOODWILL IMPAIRMENT ANALYSIS, WHICH WAS PERFORMED\nDURING THE FOURTH QUARTER OF FISCAL 2012, DID NOT RESULT IN A GOODWILL IMPAIRMENT CHARGE, NOR DID WE RECORD ANY GOODWILL IMPAIRMENT IN FISCAL 2011 OR 2010.\nWE MAKE JUDGMENTS ABOUT THE RECOVERABILITY OF PURCHASED FINITE LIVED INTANGIBLE ASSETS WHENEVER EVENTS OR CHANGES IN CIRCUMSTANCES INDICATE THAT AN IMPAIRMENT MAY EXIST. EACH PERIOD WE EVALUATE THE\nESTIMATED REMAINING USEFUL LIVES OF PURCHASED INTANGIBLE ASSETS AND WHETHER EVENTS OR CHANGES IN CIRCUMSTANCES WARRANT A REVISION TO THE REMAINING PERIODS OF AMORTIZATION. RECOVERABILITY OF FINITE LIVED INTANGIBLE ASSETS IS MEASURED BY COMPARISON OF\nTHE CARRYING AMOUNT OF THE ASSET TO THE FUTURE UNDISCOUNTED CASH FLOWS THE ASSET IS EXPECTED TO GENERATE. WE REVIEW INDEFINITE LIVED INTANGIBLE ASSETS FOR IMPAIRMENT ANNUALLY AND WHENEVER EVENTS OR CHANGES IN CIRCUMSTANCES INDICATE THE CARRYING\nVALUE MAY NOT BE RECOVERABLE. RECOVERABILITY OF INDEFINITE LIVED INTANGIBLE ASSETS IS MEASURED BY COMPARISON OF THE CARRYING AMOUNT OF THE ASSET TO ITS FAIR VALUE. IF THE ASSET IS CONSIDERED TO BE IMPAIRED, THE AMOUNT OF ANY IMPAIRMENT IS MEASURED\nAS THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE CARRYING VALUE AND THE FAIR VALUE OF THE IMPAIRED ASSET.\nASSUMPTIONS AND ESTIMATES ABOUT FUTURE VALUES AND\nREMAINING USEFUL LIVES OF OUR INTANGIBLE AND OTHER LONG-LIVED ASSETS ARE COMPLEX AND SUBJECTIVE. THEY CAN BE AFFECTED BY A VARIETY OF FACTORS, INCLUDING EXTERNAL FACTORS SUCH AS INDUSTRY AND ECONOMIC TRENDS AND INTERNAL FACTORS SUCH AS CHANGES IN\nOUR BUSINESS STRATEGY AND OUR INTERNAL FORECASTS. ALTHOUGH WE BELIEVE THE HISTORICAL ASSUMPTIONS AND ESTIMATES WE HAVE MADE ARE REASONABLE AND APPROPRIATE, DIFFERENT ASSUMPTIONS AND ESTIMATES COULD MATERIALLY IMPACT OUR REPORTED FINANCIAL RESULTS.\nWE DID NOT RECOGNIZE ANY INTANGIBLE ASSET IMPAIRMENT CHARGES IN FISCAL 2012, 2011 OR 2010.\nACCOUNTING FOR INCOME TAXES\nSIGNIFICANT JUDGMENT IS REQUIRED IN DETERMINING OUR WORLDWIDE INCOME TAX PROVISION. IN THE ORDINARY COURSE OF A GLOBAL BUSINESS, THERE\nARE MANY TRANSACTIONS AND CALCULATIONS WHERE THE ULTIMATE TAX OUTCOME IS UNCERTAIN. SOME OF THESE UNCERTAINTIES ARISE AS A CONSEQUENCE OF REVENUE SHARING AND COST REIMBURSEMENT ARRANGEMENTS AMONG RELATED ENTITIES, THE PROCESS OF IDENTIFYING ITEMS OF\nREVENUES AND EXPENSES THAT QUALIFY FOR PREFERENTIAL TAX TREATMENT AND SEGREGATION OF FOREIGN AND DOMESTIC EARNINGS AND EXPENSES TO AVOID DOUBLE TAXATION. ALTHOUGH WE\n50\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nBELIEVE THAT OUR ESTIMATES ARE REASONABLE, THE FINAL TAX OUTCOME OF THESE MATTERS COULD BE DIFFERENT FROM THAT WHICH IS REFLECTED IN OUR HISTORICAL INCOME TAX PROVISIONS AND ACCRUALS. SUCH\nDIFFERENCES COULD HAVE A MATERIAL EFFECT ON OUR INCOME TAX PROVISION AND NET INCOME IN THE PERIOD IN WHICH SUCH DETERMINATION IS MADE.\nOUR\nEFFECTIVE TAX RATE INCLUDES THE IMPACT OF CERTAIN UNDISTRIBUTED FOREIGN EARNINGS FOR WHICH NO U.S. TAXES HAVE BEEN PROVIDED BECAUSE SUCH EARNINGS ARE PLANNED TO BE INDEFINITELY REINVESTED OUTSIDE THE UNITED STATES. REMITTANCES OF FOREIGN EARNINGS TO\nTHE UNITED STATES ARE PLANNED BASED ON PROJECTED CASH FLOW, WORKING CAPITAL AND INVESTMENT NEEDS OF OUR FOREIGN AND DOMESTIC OPERATIONS. BASED ON THESE ASSUMPTIONS, WE ESTIMATE THE AMOUNT THAT WILL BE DISTRIBUTED TO THE UNITED STATES AND PROVIDE\nU.S. FEDERAL TAXES ON THESE AMOUNTS. MATERIAL CHANGES IN OUR ESTIMATES AS TO HOW MUCH OF OUR FOREIGN EARNINGS WILL BE DISTRIBUTED TO THE UNITED STATES OR TAX LEGISLATION THAT LIMITS OR RESTRICTS THE AMOUNT OF UNDISTRIBUTED FOREIGN EARNINGS THAT WE\nCONSIDER INDEFINITELY REINVESTED OUTSIDE THE UNITED STATES COULD MATERIALLY IMPACT OUR INCOME TAX PROVISION AND EFFECTIVE TAX RATE.\nWE RECORD\nA VALUATION ALLOWANCE TO REDUCE OUR DEFERRED TAX ASSETS TO THE AMOUNT THAT IS MORE LIKELY THAN NOT TO BE REALIZED. IN ORDER FOR US TO REALIZE OUR DEFERRED TAX ASSETS, WE MUST BE ABLE TO GENERATE SUFFICIENT TAXABLE INCOME IN THOSE JURISDICTIONS WHERE\nTHE DEFERRED TAX ASSETS ARE LOCATED. WE CONSIDER FUTURE GROWTH, FORECASTED EARNINGS, FUTURE TAXABLE INCOME, THE MIX OF EARNINGS IN THE JURISDICTIONS IN WHICH WE OPERATE, HISTORICAL EARNINGS, TAXABLE INCOME IN PRIOR YEARS, IF CARRYBACK IS PERMITTED\nUNDER THE LAW AND PRUDENT AND FEASIBLE TAX PLANNING STRATEGIES IN DETERMINING THE NEED FOR A VALUATION ALLOWANCE. IN THE EVENT WE WERE TO DETERMINE THAT WE WOULD NOT BE ABLE TO REALIZE ALL OR PART OF OUR NET DEFERRED TAX ASSETS IN THE FUTURE, AN\nADJUSTMENT TO THE DEFERRED TAX ASSETS VALUATION ALLOWANCE WOULD BE CHARGED TO EARNINGS IN THE PERIOD IN WHICH WE MAKE SUCH A DETERMINATION, OR GOODWILL WOULD BE ADJUSTED AT OUR FINAL DETERMINATION OF THE VALUATION ALLOWANCE RELATED TO AN ACQUISITION\nWITHIN THE MEASUREMENT PERIOD. IF WE LATER DETERMINE THAT IT IS MORE LIKELY THAN NOT THAT THE NET DEFERRED TAX ASSETS WOULD BE REALIZED, WE WOULD REVERSE THE APPLICABLE PORTION OF THE PREVIOUSLY PROVIDED VALUATION ALLOWANCE AS AN ADJUSTMENT TO\nEARNINGS AT SUCH TIME.\nWE CALCULATE OUR CURRENT AND DEFERRED TAX PROVISION BASED ON ESTIMATES AND ASSUMPTIONS THAT COULD DIFFER FROM THE\nACTUAL RESULTS REFLECTED IN INCOME TAX RETURNS FILED DURING THE SUBSEQUENT YEAR. ADJUSTMENTS BASED ON FILED RETURNS ARE GENERALLY RECORDED IN THE PERIOD WHEN THE TAX RETURNS ARE FILED AND THE GLOBAL TAX IMPLICATIONS ARE KNOWN, WHICH CAN MATERIALLY\nIMPACT OUR EFFECTIVE TAX RATE.\nTHE AMOUNT OF INCOME TAX WE PAY IS SUBJECT TO ONGOING AUDITS BY FEDERAL, STATE AND FOREIGN TAX AUTHORITIES,\nWHICH OFTEN RESULT IN PROPOSED ASSESSMENTS. OUR ESTIMATE OF THE POTENTIAL OUTCOME FOR ANY UNCERTAIN TAX ISSUE IS HIGHLY JUDGMENTAL. A DESCRIPTION OF OUR ACCOUNTING POLICIES ASSOCIATED WITH TAX RELATED CONTINGENCIES ASSUMED AS A PART OF A BUSINESS\nCOMBINATION IS PROVIDED UNDER \u0093BUSINESS COMBINATIONS\u0094 ABOVE. FOR THOSE TAX RELATED CONTINGENCIES THAT ARE NOT A PART OF A BUSINESS COMBINATION, WE ACCOUNT FOR THESE UNCERTAIN TAX ISSUES PURSUANT TO ASC 740,\nINCOME TAXES\n, WHICH\nCONTAINS A TWO-STEP APPROACH TO RECOGNIZING AND MEASURING UNCERTAIN TAX POSITIONS TAKEN OR EXPECTED TO BE TAKEN IN A TAX RETURN. THE FIRST STEP IS TO DETERMINE IF THE WEIGHT OF AVAILABLE EVIDENCE INDICATES THAT IT IS MORE LIKELY THAN NOT THAT THE\nTAX POSITION WILL BE SUSTAINED ON AUDIT, INCLUDING RESOLUTION OF ANY RELATED APPEALS OR LITIGATION PROCESSES. THE SECOND STEP IS TO MEASURE THE TAX BENEFIT AS THE LARGEST AMOUNT THAT IS MORE THAN 50% LIKELY TO BE REALIZED UPON ULTIMATE SETTLEMENT.\nALTHOUGH WE BELIEVE WE HAVE ADEQUATELY RESERVED FOR OUR UNCERTAIN TAX POSITIONS, NO ASSURANCE CAN BE GIVEN WITH RESPECT TO THE FINAL OUTCOME OF THESE MATTERS. WE ADJUST RESERVES FOR OUR UNCERTAIN TAX POSITIONS DUE TO CHANGING FACTS AND\nCIRCUMSTANCES, SUCH AS THE CLOSING OF A TAX AUDIT, JUDICIAL RULINGS, REFINEMENT OF ESTIMATES OR REALIZATION OF EARNINGS OR DEDUCTIONS THAT DIFFER FROM OUR ESTIMATES. TO THE EXTENT THAT THE FINAL OUTCOME OF THESE MATTERS IS DIFFERENT THAN THE AMOUNTS\nRECORDED, SUCH DIFFERENCES GENERALLY WILL IMPACT OUR PROVISION FOR INCOME TAXES IN THE PERIOD IN WHICH SUCH A DETERMINATION IS MADE. OUR PROVISIONS FOR INCOME TAXES INCLUDE THE IMPACT OF RESERVE PROVISIONS AND CHANGES TO RESERVES THAT ARE CONSIDERED\nAPPROPRIATE AND ALSO INCLUDE THE RELATED INTEREST AND PENALTIES.\nIN ADDITION, AS A PART OF OUR ACCOUNTING FOR BUSINESS COMBINATIONS,\nINTANGIBLE ASSETS ARE RECOGNIZED AT FAIR VALUES AND GOODWILL IS MEASURED AS THE EXCESS OF CONSIDERATION TRANSFERRED OVER THE NET ESTIMATED FAIR VALUES OF ASSETS ACQUIRED. IMPAIRMENT CHARGES ASSOCIATED WITH GOODWILL ARE GENERALLY NOT TAX DEDUCTIBLE\nAND WILL RESULT IN AN INCREASED EFFECTIVE INCOME TAX RATE IN THE PERIOD THAT ANY IMPAIRMENT IS RECORDED. AMORTIZATION EXPENSES ASSOCIATED WITH ACQUIRED INTANGIBLE ASSETS ARE GENERALLY NOT TAX DEDUCTIBLE PURSUANT TO OUR EXISTING TAX STRUCTURE;\nHOWEVER, DEFERRED TAXES HAVE BEEN RECORDED FOR NON-DEDUCTIBLE AMORTIZATION EXPENSES AS A PART OF THE ACCOUNTING FOR BUSINESS COMBINATIONS. WE HAVE TAKEN INTO ACCOUNT THE ALLOCATION OF THESE IDENTIFIED INTANGIBLES AMONG DIFFERENT TAXING\nJURISDICTIONS, INCLUDING THOSE WITH NOMINAL OR ZERO PERCENT TAX RATES, IN ESTABLISHING THE RELATED DEFERRED TAX LIABILITIES.\n51\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nLEGAL AND OTHER CONTINGENCIES\nWE ARE CURRENTLY INVOLVED IN VARIOUS CLAIMS AND LEGAL PROCEEDINGS. QUARTERLY, WE REVIEW THE STATUS OF EACH SIGNIFICANT MATTER AND ASSESS OUR POTENTIAL FINANCIAL EXPOSURE. A DESCRIPTION OF OUR ACCOUNTING\nPOLICIES ASSOCIATED WITH CONTINGENCIES ASSUMED AS A PART OF A BUSINESS COMBINATION IS PROVIDED UNDER \u0093BUSINESS COMBINATIONS\u0094 ABOVE. FOR LEGAL AND OTHER CONTINGENCIES THAT ARE NOT A PART OF A BUSINESS COMBINATION, WE ACCRUE A LIABILITY FOR\nAN ESTIMATED LOSS IF THE POTENTIAL LOSS FROM ANY CLAIM OR LEGAL PROCEEDING IS CONSIDERED PROBABLE AND THE AMOUNT CAN BE REASONABLY ESTIMATED. SIGNIFICANT JUDGMENT IS REQUIRED IN BOTH THE DETERMINATION OF PROBABILITY AND THE DETERMINATION AS TO\nWHETHER THE AMOUNT OF AN EXPOSURE IS REASONABLY ESTIMABLE. BECAUSE OF UNCERTAINTIES RELATED TO THESE MATTERS, ACCRUALS ARE BASED ONLY ON THE BEST INFORMATION AVAILABLE AT THE TIME THE ACCRUALS ARE MADE. AS ADDITIONAL INFORMATION BECOMES AVAILABLE,\nWE REASSESS THE POTENTIAL LIABILITY RELATED TO OUR PENDING CLAIMS AND LITIGATION AND MAY REVISE OUR ESTIMATES. SUCH REVISIONS IN THE ESTIMATES OF THE POTENTIAL LIABILITIES COULD HAVE A MATERIAL IMPACT ON OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL\nPOSITION.\nSTOCK-BASED COMPENSATION\nWE ACCOUNT FOR SHARE-BASED PAYMENTS TO EMPLOYEES, INCLUDING GRANTS OF EMPLOYEE STOCK OPTIONS, RESTRICTED STOCK-BASED AWARDS AND PURCHASES UNDER EMPLOYEE STOCK PURCHASE PLANS, IN ACCORDANCE WITH ASC 718,\nCOMPENSATION\u0097STOCK COMPENSATION,\nWHICH REQUIRES THAT SHARE-BASED PAYMENTS (TO THE EXTENT THEY ARE COMPENSATORY) BE RECOGNIZED IN OUR CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF OPERATIONS BASED ON THEIR FAIR VALUES. WE RECOGNIZE STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION\nEXPENSE ON A STRAIGHT-LINE BASIS OVER THE SERVICE PERIOD OF THE AWARD, WHICH IS GENERALLY FOUR YEARS.\nWE ARE REQUIRED TO ESTIMATE THE STOCK\nAWARDS THAT WE ULTIMATELY EXPECT TO VEST AND TO REDUCE STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION EXPENSE FOR THE EFFECTS OF ESTIMATED FORFEITURES OF AWARDS OVER THE EXPENSE RECOGNITION PERIOD. ALTHOUGH WE ESTIMATE THE RATE OF FUTURE FORFEITURES BASED UPON HISTORICAL\nEXPERIENCE, ACTUAL FORFEITURES IN THE FUTURE MAY DIFFER. TO THE EXTENT OUR ACTUAL FORFEITURES ARE DIFFERENT THAN OUR ESTIMATES, WE RECORD A TRUE-UP FOR THE DIFFERENCE IN THE PERIOD THAT THE AWARDS VEST AND SUCH TRUE-UPS COULD MATERIALLY AFFECT OUR\nOPERATING RESULTS. ADDITIONALLY, WE ALSO CONSIDER ON A QUARTERLY BASIS WHETHER THERE HAVE BEEN ANY SIGNIFICANT CHANGES IN FACTS AND CIRCUMSTANCES THAT WOULD AFFECT OUR EXPECTED FORFEITURE RATE.\nWE ESTIMATE THE FAIR VALUES OF EMPLOYEE STOCK OPTIONS USING A BLACK-SCHOLES-MERTON VALUATION MODEL. THE FAIR VALUE OF AN AWARD IS AFFECTED BY OUR STOCK\nPRICE ON THE DATE OF GRANT AS WELL AS OTHER ASSUMPTIONS INCLUDING THE ESTIMATED VOLATILITY OF OUR STOCK PRICE OVER THE TERM OF THE AWARDS AND THE ESTIMATED PERIOD OF TIME THAT WE EXPECT EMPLOYEES TO HOLD THEIR STOCK OPTIONS. THE RISK-FREE INTEREST\nRATE ASSUMPTION WE USE IS BASED UPON UNITED STATES TREASURY INTEREST RATES APPROPRIATE FOR THE EXPECTED LIFE OF THE AWARDS. WE USE THE IMPLIED VOLATILITY OF OUR PUBLICLY TRADED OPTIONS IN ORDER TO ESTIMATE FUTURE STOCK PRICE TRENDS AS WE BELIEVE\nTHAT IMPLIED VOLATILITY IS MORE REPRESENTATIVE OF FUTURE STOCK PRICE TRENDS THAN HISTORICAL VOLATILITY. IN ORDER TO DETERMINE THE ESTIMATED PERIOD OF TIME THAT WE EXPECT EMPLOYEES TO HOLD THEIR STOCK OPTIONS, WE HAVE USED HISTORICAL RATES OF\nEMPLOYEE GROUPS BY SENIORITY OF JOB CLASSIFICATION. OUR EXPECTED DIVIDEND RATE IS BASED UPON AN ANNUALIZED DIVIDEND YIELD BASED ON THE PER SHARE DIVIDEND DECLARED BY OUR BOARD OF DIRECTORS. THE AFOREMENTIONED INPUTS ENTERED INTO THE OPTION VALUATION\nMODEL WE USE TO FAIR VALUE OUR STOCK AWARDS ARE SUBJECTIVE ESTIMATES AND CHANGES TO THESE ESTIMATES WILL CAUSE THE FAIR VALUES OF OUR STOCK AWARDS AND RELATED STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION EXPENSE THAT WE RECORD TO VARY.\nWE RECORD DEFERRED TAX ASSETS FOR STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION AWARDS THAT RESULT IN DEDUCTIONS ON OUR INCOME TAX RETURNS, BASED ON THE AMOUNT OF STOCK-BASED\nCOMPENSATION RECOGNIZED AND THE FAIR VALUES ATTRIBUTABLE TO THE VESTED PORTION OF STOCK AWARDS ASSUMED IN CONNECTION WITH A BUSINESS COMBINATION, AT THE STATUTORY TAX RATE IN THE JURISDICTION IN WHICH WE WILL RECEIVE A TAX DEDUCTION. BECAUSE THE\nDEFERRED TAX ASSETS WE RECORD ARE BASED UPON THE STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION EXPENSES IN A PARTICULAR JURISDICTION, THE AFOREMENTIONED INPUTS THAT AFFECT THE FAIR VALUES OF OUR STOCK AWARDS MAY ALSO INDIRECTLY AFFECT OUR INCOME TAX EXPENSE. IN\nADDITION, DIFFERENCES BETWEEN THE DEFERRED TAX ASSETS RECOGNIZED FOR FINANCIAL REPORTING PURPOSES AND THE ACTUAL TAX DEDUCTION REPORTED ON OUR INCOME TAX RETURNS ARE RECORDED IN ADDITIONAL PAID-IN CAPITAL. IF THE TAX DEDUCTION IS LESS THAN THE\nDEFERRED TAX ASSET, THE CALCULATED SHORTFALL REDUCES OUR POOL OF EXCESS TAX BENEFITS. IF THE POOL OF EXCESS TAX BENEFITS IS REDUCED TO ZERO, THEN SUBSEQUENT SHORTFALLS WOULD INCREASE OUR INCOME TAX EXPENSE.\n52\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nTO THE EXTENT WE CHANGE THE TERMS OF OUR EMPLOYEE STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION PROGRAMS, EXPERIENCE MARKET\nVOLATILITY IN THE PRICING OF OUR COMMON STOCK THAT INCREASES THE IMPLIED VOLATILITY CALCULATION OF OUR PUBLICLY TRADED OPTIONS, REFINE DIFFERENT ASSUMPTIONS IN FUTURE PERIODS SUCH AS FORFEITURE RATES THAT DIFFER FROM OUR CURRENT ESTIMATES, OR ASSUME\nSTOCK AWARDS FROM ACQUIRED COMPANIES THAT ARE DIFFERENT IN NATURE THAN OUR STOCK AWARD ARRANGEMENTS, AMONG OTHER POTENTIAL IMPACTS, THE STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION EXPENSE THAT WE RECORD IN FUTURE PERIODS AND THE TAX BENEFITS THAT WE REALIZE MAY DIFFER\nSIGNIFICANTLY FROM WHAT WE HAVE RECORDED IN PREVIOUS REPORTING PERIODS.\nALLOWANCES FOR DOUBTFUL ACCOUNTS\nWE MAKE JUDGMENTS AS TO OUR ABILITY TO COLLECT OUTSTANDING RECEIVABLES AND PROVIDE ALLOWANCES FOR THE PORTION OF RECEIVABLES WHEN COLLECTION BECOMES\nDOUBTFUL. PROVISIONS ARE MADE BASED UPON A SPECIFIC REVIEW OF ALL SIGNIFICANT OUTSTANDING INVOICES. FOR THOSE INVOICES NOT SPECIFICALLY REVIEWED, PROVISIONS ARE PROVIDED AT DIFFERING RATES, BASED UPON THE AGE OF THE RECEIVABLE, THE COLLECTION\nHISTORY ASSOCIATED WITH THE GEOGRAPHIC REGION THAT THE RECEIVABLE WAS RECORDED AND CURRENT ECONOMIC TRENDS. IF THE HISTORICAL DATA THAT WE USE TO CALCULATE THE ALLOWANCES FOR DOUBTFUL ACCOUNTS DOES NOT REFLECT THE FUTURE ABILITY TO COLLECT\nOUTSTANDING RECEIVABLES, ADDITIONAL PROVISIONS FOR DOUBTFUL ACCOUNTS MAY BE NEEDED AND OUR FUTURE RESULTS OF OPERATIONS COULD BE MATERIALLY AFFECTED.\nRESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nIMPACT OF ACQUISITIONS\nTHE COMPARABILITY OF OUR OPERATING RESULTS IN FISCAL 2012 COMPARED TO FISCAL 2011 IS IMPACTED BY OUR ACQUISITIONS, PRIMARILY THE ACQUISITION OF TALEO IN\nTHE FOURTH QUARTER OF FISCAL 2012, RIGHTNOW IN THE THIRD QUARTER OF FISCAL 2012, ATG IN THE THIRD QUARTER OF FISCAL 2011 AND PHASE FORWARD DURING THE FIRST QUARTER OF FISCAL 2011.\nTHE COMPARABILITY OF OUR OPERATING RESULTS IN FISCAL 2011 COMPARED TO FISCAL 2010 IS IMPACTED BY OUR ACQUISITIONS, PRIMARILY THE ACQUISITION OF SUN IN THE THIRD QUARTER OF FISCAL 2010 AND, TO A LESSER\nEXTENT, OUR ACQUISITIONS OF ATG IN THE THIRD QUARTER OF FISCAL 2011 AND PHASE FORWARD DURING THE FIRST QUARTER OF FISCAL 2011.\nIN OUR\nDISCUSSION OF CHANGES IN OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS FROM FISCAL 2012 COMPARED TO FISCAL 2011 AND FISCAL 2011 COMPARED TO FISCAL 2010, WE QUANTIFY THE CONTRIBUTIONS OF OUR ACQUIRED PRODUCTS TO THE GROWTH IN NEW SOFTWARE LICENSE REVENUES, SOFTWARE\nLICENSE UPDATES AND PRODUCT SUPPORT REVENUES, HARDWARE SYSTEMS PRODUCTS REVENUES (AS APPLICABLE) AND HARDWARE SYSTEMS SUPPORT REVENUES (AS APPLICABLE) FOR THE ONE YEAR PERIOD SUBSEQUENT TO THE ACQUISITION DATE. WE ALSO ARE ABLE TO QUANTIFY THE TOTAL\nINCREMENTAL EXPENSES ASSOCIATED WITH OUR HARDWARE SYSTEMS PRODUCTS AND HARDWARE SYSTEMS SUPPORT OPERATING SEGMENTS FOR FISCAL 2011 IN COMPARISON TO FISCAL 2010. THE INCREMENTAL CONTRIBUTIONS OF OUR ACQUISITIONS TO OUR OTHER BUSINESSES AND OPERATING\nSEGMENTS\u0092 REVENUES AND EXPENSES ARE NOT PROVIDED AS THEY EITHER WERE NOT SEPARATELY IDENTIFIABLE DUE TO THE INTEGRATION OF THESE OPERATING SEGMENTS INTO OUR EXISTING OPERATIONS AND\/OR WERE INSIGNIFICANT TO OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS DURING THE\nPERIODS PRESENTED.\nWE CAUTION READERS THAT, WHILE PRE- AND POST-ACQUISITION COMPARISONS, AS WELL AS THE QUANTIFIED AMOUNTS THEMSELVES MAY\nPROVIDE INDICATIONS OF GENERAL TRENDS, THE ACQUISITION INFORMATION THAT WE PROVIDE HAS INHERENT LIMITATIONS FOR THE FOLLOWING REASONS.\n\u0095\nTHE QUANTIFICATIONS CANNOT ADDRESS THE SUBSTANTIAL EFFECTS ATTRIBUTABLE TO CHANGES IN BUSINESS STRATEGIES, INCLUDING OUR SALES FORCE INTEGRATION\nEFFORTS.

AS A RESULT, TOTAL REVENUES AND EXPENSES WILL CONTINUE TO BE AFFECTED BY\nCHANGES IN THE U.S. DOLLAR AGAINST MAJOR INTERNATIONAL CURRENCIES. IN ORDER TO PROVIDE A FRAMEWORK FOR ASSESSING HOW OUR UNDERLYING BUSINESSES PERFORMED EXCLUDING THE EFFECT OF FOREIGN CURRENCY FLUCTUATIONS, WE COMPARE THE PERCENT CHANGE IN THE\nRESULTS FROM ONE PERIOD TO ANOTHER PERIOD IN THIS ANNUAL REPORT USING CONSTANT CURRENCY DISCLOSURE. TO PRESENT THIS INFORMATION, CURRENT AND COMPARATIVE PRIOR PERIOD RESULTS FOR ENTITIES REPORTING IN CURRENCIES OTHER THAN U.S. DOLLARS ARE CONVERTED\nINTO U.S. DOLLARS AT CONSTANT EXCHANGE RATES (I.E. THE RATES IN EFFECT ON MAY 31, 2011, WHICH WAS THE LAST DAY OF OUR PRIOR FISCAL YEAR) RATHER THAN THE ACTUAL EXCHANGE RATES IN EFFECT DURING THE RESPECTIVE PERIODS. FOR EXAMPLE, IF AN ENTITY\nREPORTING IN EUROS HAD REVENUES OF 1.0 MILLION EUROS FROM PRODUCTS SOLD ON MAY 31, 2012 AND MAY 31, 2011, OUR FINANCIAL STATEMENTS WOULD REFLECT REPORTED REVENUES OF $1.25 MILLION IN FISCAL 2012 (USING 1.25 AS THE MONTH-END AVERAGE\nEXCHANGE RATE FOR THE PERIOD) AND $1.41 MILLION IN FISCAL 2011 (USING 1.41 AS THE MONTH-END AVERAGE EXCHANGE RATE FOR THE PERIOD). THE CONSTANT CURRENCY PRESENTATION WOULD TRANSLATE THE FISCAL 2012 RESULTS USING THE FISCAL 2011 EXCHANGE RATE AND\nINDICATE, IN THIS EXAMPLE, NO CHANGE IN REVENUES DURING THE PERIOD. IN EACH OF THE TABLES BELOW, WE PRESENT THE PERCENT CHANGE BASED ON ACTUAL, UNROUNDED RESULTS IN REPORTED CURRENCY AND IN CONSTANT CURRENCY.\nTOTAL REVENUES AND OPERATING EXPENSES\nYEAR ENDED MAY 31,\n2012\nPERCENT CHANGE\n2011\nPERCENT CHANGE\n2010\n(DOLLARS IN MILLIONS)\nACTUAL\nCONSTANT\nACTUAL\nCONSTANT\nTOTAL REVENUES BY GEOGRAPHY.\nAMERICAS\n$19,236\n5%\n5%\n$18,352\n33%\n32%\n$13,819\nEMEA\n(1)\n11,561\n1%\n1%\n11,497\n29%\n28%\n8,938\nASIA PACIFIC\n(2)\n6,324\n10%\n7%\n5,773\n42%\n32%\n4,063\nTOTAL REVENUES\n37,121\n4%\n4%\n35,622\n33%\n30%\n26,820\nTOTAL OPERATING EXPENSES\n23,415\n-1%\n-1%\n23,589\n33%\n31%\n17,758\nTOTAL OPERATING MARGIN\n$13,706\n14%\n14%\n$12,033\n33%\n29%\n$9,062\nTOTAL OPERATING MARGIN %\n37%\n34%\n34%% REVENUES BY GEOGRAPHY.\nAMERICAS\n52%\n52%\n52%\nEMEA\n31%\n32%\n33%\nASIA PACIFIC\n17%\n16%\n15%\nTOTAL REVENUES BY BUSINESS.\nSOFTWARE\n$26,116\n9%\n9%\n$24,031\n17%\n15%\n$20,625\nHARDWARE SYSTEMS\n6,302\n-9%\n-10%\n6,944\n203%\n195%\n2,290\nSERVICES\n4,703\n1%\n1%\n4,647\n19%\n17%\n3,905\nTOTAL REVENUES\n$37,121\n4%\n4%\n$35,622\n33%\n30%\n$26,820% REVENUES BY BUSINESS.\nSOFTWARE\n70%\n68%\n77%\nHARDWARE SYSTEMS\n17%\n19%\n9%\nSERVICES\n13%\n13%\n14%\n(1)\nCOMPRISED OF EUROPE, THE MIDDLE EAST AND AFRICA\n(2)\nASIA PACIFIC INCLUDES JAPAN\nFISCAL 2012 COMPARED TO FISCAL 2011\n.\nEXCLUDING THE EFFECT OF FOREIGN CURRENCY RATE FLUCTUATIONS, THE INCREASE\nIN OUR TOTAL REVENUES IN FISCAL 2012 WAS PRIMARILY ATTRIBUTABLE TO GROWTH IN OUR SOFTWARE BUSINESS\u0092 REVENUES, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY A REDUCTION IN OUR HARDWARE SYSTEMS BUSINESS\u0092 REVENUES.

THE INCREASE IN CASH, CASH EQUIVALENTS AND MARKETABLE SECURITIES AT MAY 31, 2012 IN COMPARISON TO MAY 31, 2011 WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO AN INCREASE IN CASH GENERATED FROM OUR OPERATING ACTIVITIES AND OUR\nSHORT-TERM BORROWING OF $1.7 BILLION MADE PURSUANT TO A REVOLVING CREDIT AGREEMENT.

ADDITIONALLY, CASH, CASH EQUIVALENTS AND MARKETABLE SECURITIES BALANCES INCREASED DUE TO THE WEAKENING\nOF THE U.S. DOLLAR IN COMPARISON TO CERTAIN MAJOR INTERNATIONAL CURRENCIES DURING FISCAL 2011. THESE INCREASES IN OUR CASH, CASH EQUIVALENTS AND MARKETABLE SECURITIES BALANCES WERE PARTIALLY OFFSET BY THE REPAYMENT OF $2.25 BILLION OF OUR\nSENIOR NOTES WHICH MATURED IN JANUARY 2011, THE REPAYMENT OF $881 MILLION OF COMMERCIAL PAPER NOTES, THE USAGE OF $1.9 BILLION OF NET CASH FOR ACQUISITIONS, REPURCHASES OF OUR COMMON STOCK AND THE PAYMENTS OF CASH DIVIDENDS TO OUR STOCKHOLDERS.\nDAYS SALES OUTSTANDING, WHICH IS CALCULATED BY DIVIDING PERIOD END ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE BY AVERAGE DAILY SALES FOR THE QUARTER, WAS 53 DAYS AT\nMAY 31, 2012 COMPARED WITH 55 DAYS AT MAY 31, 2011.

WE ALSO OBTAIN INDIVIDUAL HARDWARE COMPONENTS FOR OUR PRODUCTS FROM A VARIETY OF INDIVIDUAL SUPPLIERS BASED ON PROJECTED DEMAND INFORMATION. SUCH PURCHASE COMMITMENTS ARE BASED ON OUR FORECASTED COMPONENT AND\nMANUFACTURING REQUIREMENTS AND TYPICALLY PROVIDE FOR FULFILLMENT WITHIN AGREED UPON LEAD-TIMES AND\/OR COMMERCIALLY STANDARD LEAD-TIMES FOR THE PARTICULAR PART OR PRODUCT AND HAVE BEEN INCLUDED IN THE AMOUNT PRESENTED IN THE ABOVE CONTRACTUAL\nOBLIGATIONS TABLE.

WE HAVE REACHED CERTAIN SETTLEMENT AGREEMENTS WITH RELEVANT TAXING AUTHORITIES TO PAY APPROXIMATELY $47.5 MILLION OF THESE LIABILITIES.

WE EXPECT TO CLOSE SUCH ACQUISITIONS WITHIN THE NEXT TWELVE MONTHS.\nWE\nBELIEVE THAT OUR CURRENT CASH, CASH EQUIVALENTS AND MARKETABLE SECURITIES AND CASH GENERATED FROM OPERATIONS WILL BE SUFFICIENT TO MEET OUR WORKING CAPITAL, CAPITAL EXPENDITURES AND CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATION REQUIREMENTS.

IN ADDITION, OUR EUROPEAN OPERATIONS\nGENERALLY PROVIDE LOWER REVENUES IN OUR FIRST FISCAL QUARTER BECAUSE OF THE REDUCED ECONOMIC ACTIVITY IN EUROPE DURING THE SUMMER. THESE SEASONAL FACTORS ARE COMMON IN THE HIGH TECHNOLOGY INDUSTRY. THESE FACTORS HAVE CAUSED A DECREASE IN OUR FIRST\nQUARTER REVENUES AS COMPARED TO REVENUES IN THE IMMEDIATELY PRECEDING FOURTH QUARTER, WHICH HISTORICALLY HAS BEEN OUR HIGHEST REVENUE QUARTER WITHIN A PARTICULAR FISCAL YEAR. SIMILARLY, THE OPERATING INCOME OF OUR BUSINESS IS AFFECTED BY SEASONAL\nFACTORS IN A CONSISTENT MANNER AS OUR REVENUES (IN PARTICULAR, OUR NEW SOFTWARE LICENSES SEGMENT) AS CERTAIN EXPENSES WITHIN OUR COST STRUCTURE ARE RELATIVELY FIXED IN THE SHORT-TERM. WE EXPECT THESE TRENDS TO CONTINUE IN FISCAL 2013.\nTHE FOLLOWING TABLES SET FORTH SELECTED UNAUDITED QUARTERLY INFORMATION FOR OUR LAST EIGHT FISCAL QUARTERS.

WE HISTORICALLY HAVE GRANTED ONLY STOCK OPTIONS TO OUR EMPLOYEES AND ANY RESTRICTED STOCK-BASED AWARDS OUTSTANDING WERE ASSUMED AS A RESULT OF OUR ACQUISITIONS.\nWE RECOGNIZE THAT OPTIONS AND RESTRICTED STOCK-BASED AWARDS DILUTE EXISTING STOCKHOLDERS AND HAVE SOUGHT TO CONTROL THE NUMBER OF OPTIONS AND RESTRICTED\nSTOCK-BASED AWARDS GRANTED WHILE PROVIDING COMPETITIVE COMPENSATION PACKAGES. CONSISTENT WITH THESE DUAL GOALS, OUR CUMULATIVE POTENTIAL DILUTION SINCE JUNE 1, 2009 HAS BEEN A WEIGHTED AVERAGE ANNUALIZED RATE OF 1.7% PER YEAR. THE\nPOTENTIAL DILUTION PERCENTAGE IS CALCULATED AS THE AVERAGE ANNUALIZED NEW OPTIONS OR RESTRICTED STOCK-BASED AWARDS GRANTED AND ASSUMED, NET OF OPTIONS AND RESTRICTED STOCK-BASED AWARDS FORFEITED BY EMPLOYEES LEAVING THE COMPANY, DIVIDED BY THE\nWEIGHTED AVERAGE OUTSTANDING SHARES DURING THE CALCULATION PERIOD. THIS MAXIMUM POTENTIAL DILUTION WILL ONLY RESULT IF ALL OPTIONS ARE EXERCISED AND RESTRICTED STOCK-BASED AWARDS VEST. SOME OF THE OUTSTANDING OPTIONS, WHICH GENERALLY HAVE A 10 YEAR\nEXERCISE PERIOD, HAVE EXERCISE PRICES HIGHER THAN THE CURRENT MARKET PRICE OF OUR COMMON STOCK. AT MAY 31, 2012, 28.0% OF OUR OUTSTANDING STOCK OPTIONS HAD EXERCISE PRICES IN EXCESS OF THE CURRENT MARKET PRICE. IN RECENT YEARS, OUR STOCK\nREPURCHASE PROGRAM HAS MORE THAN OFFSET THE DILUTIVE EFFECT OF OUR STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION PROGRAM; HOWEVER, WE MAY REDUCE THE LEVEL OF OUR STOCK REPURCHASES IN THE FUTURE AS WE MAY USE OUR AVAILABLE CASH FOR ACQUISITIONS, TO PAY DIVIDENDS, TO\nREPAY OR REPURCHASE INDEBTEDNESS OR FOR OTHER PURPOSES. AT MAY 31, 2012, THE MAXIMUM POTENTIAL DILUTION FROM ALL OUTSTANDING AND UNEXERCISED STOCK OPTIONS AND RESTRICTED STOCK-BASED AWARDS, REGARDLESS OF WHEN GRANTED AND REGARDLESS OF WHETHER\nVESTED OR UNVESTED AND INCLUDING OPTIONS WHERE THE STRIKE PRICE IS HIGHER THAN THE CURRENT MARKET PRICE, WAS 8.7%.\nTHE COMPENSATION COMMITTEE\nOF THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS REVIEWS AND APPROVES THE ORGANIZATION-WIDE STOCK OPTION GRANTS TO SELECTED EMPLOYEES, ALL STOCK OPTION GRANTS TO EXECUTIVE OFFICERS AND ANY INDIVIDUAL STOCK OPTION GRANTS IN EXCESS OF 100,000 SHARES.

MANAGEMENT\u0092S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF\nFINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nTHE FOLLOWING MANAGEMENT\u0092S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS (\u0093MD&A\u0094) IS\nINTENDED TO HELP THE READER UNDERSTAND THE RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION OF MICROSOFT CORPORATION. MD&A IS PROVIDED AS A SUPPLEMENT TO, AND SHOULD BE READ IN CONJUNCTION WITH, OUR FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND THE ACCOMPANYING NOTES\nTO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.\nOVERVIEW AND OUTLOOK\nMICROSOFT IS A TECHNOLOGY LEADER FOCUSED ON HELPING PEOPLE AND BUSINESSES THROUGHOUT THE WORLD REALIZE THEIR FULL POTENTIAL. WE CREATE TECHNOLOGY THAT TRANSFORMS THE WAY PEOPLE WORK, PLAY, AND COMMUNICATE ACROSS A\nWIDE RANGE OF COMPUTING DEVICES.\nWE GENERATE REVENUE BY DEVELOPING, LICENSING, AND SUPPORTING A WIDE RANGE OF SOFTWARE PRODUCTS AND\nSERVICES, INCLUDING CLOUD-BASED SERVICES, BY DESIGNING AND SELLING HARDWARE, AND BY DELIVERING RELEVANT ONLINE ADVERTISING TO A GLOBAL AUDIENCE. OUR MOST SIGNIFICANT EXPENSES ARE RELATED TO COMPENSATING EMPLOYEES, DESIGNING, MANUFACTURING,\nMARKETING, AND SELLING OUR PRODUCTS AND SERVICES, AND INCOME TAXES.\nINDUSTRY TRENDS\nOUR INDUSTRY IS DYNAMIC AND HIGHLY COMPETITIVE, WITH FREQUENT CHANGES IN BOTH TECHNOLOGIES AND BUSINESS MODELS. EACH INDUSTRY SHIFT IS AN\nOPPORTUNITY TO CONCEIVE NEW PRODUCTS, NEW TECHNOLOGIES, OR NEW IDEAS THAT CAN FURTHER TRANSFORM THE INDUSTRY AND OUR BUSINESS. AT MICROSOFT, WE PUSH THE BOUNDARIES OF WHAT IS POSSIBLE THROUGH A BROAD RANGE OF RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT ACTIVITIES THAT\nSEEK TO ANTICIPATE THE CHANGING DEMANDS OF CUSTOMERS, INDUSTRY TRENDS, AND COMPETITIVE FORCES.\nKEY OPPORTUNITIES AND INVESTMENTS\nBASED ON OUR ASSESSMENT OF KEY TECHNOLOGY TRENDS AND OUR BROAD FOCUS ON LONG-TERM RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT OF NEW PRODUCTS AND SERVICES, WE SEE\nSIGNIFICANT OPPORTUNITIES TO DRIVE FUTURE GROWTH.\nSMART CONNECTED DEVICES\nTHE PRICE PER UNIT OF PROCESSING, STORAGE, AND NETWORKS CONTINUES TO DECLINE WHILE AT THE SAME TIME DEVICES INCREASE IN CAPABILITY. AS A RESULT,\nTHE CAPABILITIES AND ACCESSIBILITY OF PCS, TABLETS, PHONES, TELEVISIONS, AND OTHER DEVICES POWERED BY RICH SOFTWARE PLATFORMS AND APPLICATIONS CONTINUE TO GROW. AT THE SAME TIME, THE INFORMATION AND SERVICES PEOPLE USE INCREASINGLY SPAN MULTIPLE\nDEVICES ENABLED BY THE ADOPTION OF CLOUD COMPUTING.\nFOR EXAMPLE, THE DELIVERY AND QUALITY OF UNIFIED ENTERTAINMENT EXPERIENCES ACROSS\nDEVICES IS UNDERGOING DRAMATIC EVOLUTION. THESE RICH MEDIA EXPERIENCES INCLUDE BOOKS, MAGAZINES, NEWSPAPERS, GAMES, MOVIES, MUSIC, TELEVISION, AND SOCIAL INTERACTIONS WITH FAMILY, FRIENDS, AND COLLEAGUES. AT MICROSOFT, OUR APPROACH IS TO SIMPLIFY\nAND INCREASE THE ACCESSIBILITY OF THESE ENTERTAINMENT EXPERIENCES TO BROADEN MARKET PENETRATION OF OUR SOFTWARE, HARDWARE, AND SERVICES.\nADDITIONALLY, WEB CONTENT AND SOCIAL CONNECTIONS HAVE INCREASED TREMENDOUSLY AS PEOPLE SPEND MORE TIME ONLINE, WHILE DISCOVERABILITY AND\nACCESSIBILITY HAS BEEN TRANSFORMING FROM DIRECT NAVIGATION AND DOCUMENT LINKS. THERE IS SIGNIFICANT OPPORTUNITY TO DELIVER PRODUCTS AND SERVICES THAT HELP USERS MAKE FASTER, BETTER DECISIONS AND COMPLETE TASKS MORE SIMPLY WHEN USING THEIR DEVICES.\nOUR APPROACH IS TO USE MACHINE LEARNING TO UNDERSTAND USER INTENT, AND DIFFERENTIATE OUR PRODUCTS AND SERVICES BY FOCUSING ON THE INTEGRATION OF SPEECH, VISUAL, SOCIAL, AND OTHER ELEMENTS TO SIMPLIFY PEOPLE\u0092S INTERACTION WITH THE INTERNET.\nWE INVEST SIGNIFICANT RESOURCES IN ENABLING AND DEVELOPING SMART CONNECTED DEVICES THAT OFFER A UNIFIED, SEAMLESS EXPERIENCE ACROSS A\nCOMMON PLATFORM. WHETHER A PC, WINDOWS PHONE, XBOX 360, OR THE NEWLY ANNOUNCED SURFACE\n24\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nPART II\nITEM 7\nDEVICES, OUR GOAL IS TO PROVIDE USERS WITH A CONSISTENT AND COMPELLING EXPERIENCE THROUGH A COMMON USER INTERFACE AND OUR SERVICES SUCH AS SKYDRIVE, XBOX LIVE, BING, SKYPE, AND OUR WINDOWS AZURE\nCLOUD PLATFORM.\nCOMMUNICATIONS AND PRODUCTIVITY\nTHE UBIQUITY OF COMPUTING AND SOFTWARE TOOLS HAS TRANSFORMED PERSONAL AND BUSINESS PRODUCTIVITY. OVER THE LAST DECADE, MICROSOFT REDEFINED SOFTWARE PRODUCTIVITY BEYOND THE RICH OFFICE CLIENT ON THE PC. PRODUCTIVITY\nSCENARIOS NOW ENCOMPASS UNIFIED COMMUNICATIONS SUCH AS INSTANT MESSAGING, VOICE, AND VIDEO COMMUNICATIONS, BUSINESS INTELLIGENCE, COLLABORATION, CONTENT MANAGEMENT, AND RELATIONSHIP MANAGEMENT, ALL OF WHICH ARE INCREASINGLY AVAILABLE THROUGH\nSERVER-SIDE APPLICATIONS. THESE SERVER APPLICATIONS CAN BE HOSTED IN THE CLOUD BY THE CUSTOMER, A PARTNER, OR BY MICROSOFT. THERE ARE SIGNIFICANT OPPORTUNITIES TO BRING TO LIFE PRODUCTIVITY AND COMMUNICATION SCENARIOS ACROSS PCS, MOBILE, AND OTHER\nDEVICES THAT CONNECT TO SERVICES. WE INVEST SIGNIFICANT RESOURCES IN OUR PRODUCTS AND SERVICES THAT MAKE THIS POSSIBLE \u0096 DYNAMICS, EXCHANGE, LYNC, SKYPE, OFFICE, OFFICE 365, SHAREPOINT, WINDOWS LIVE, AND WINDOWS PHONE.\nCLOUD COMPUTING TRANSFORMING THE DATA CENTER AND INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY\nCLOUD-BASED SOLUTIONS PROVIDE CUSTOMERS WITH SOFTWARE, SERVICES, AND CONTENT OVER THE INTERNET BY WAY OF SHARED COMPUTING RESOURCES LOCATED IN CENTRALIZED DATA CENTERS. COMPUTING IS UNDERGOING A LONG-TERM SHIFT\nFROM CLIENT\/SERVER TO THE CLOUD, A SHIFT SIMILAR IN IMPORTANCE AND IMPACT TO THE TRANSITION FROM MAINFRAME TO CLIENT\/SERVER. THE SHIFT TO THE CLOUD IS DRIVEN BY THREE IMPORTANT ECONOMIES OF SCALE: LARGER DATA CENTERS CAN DEPLOY COMPUTATIONAL\nRESOURCES AT SIGNIFICANTLY LOWER COST PER UNIT THAN SMALLER ONES; LARGER DATA CENTERS CAN COORDINATE AND AGGREGATE DIVERSE CUSTOMER, GEOGRAPHIC, AND APPLICATION DEMAND PATTERNS IMPROVING THE UTILIZATION OF COMPUTING, STORAGE, AND NETWORK RESOURCES;\nAND MULTI-TENANCY LOWERS APPLICATION MAINTENANCE LABOR COSTS FOR LARGE PUBLIC CLOUDS. BECAUSE OF THE IMPROVED ECONOMICS, THE CLOUD OFFERS UNIQUE LEVELS OF ELASTICITY AND AGILITY THAT ENABLES NEW SOLUTIONS AND APPLICATIONS. FOR BUSINESSES OF ALL\nSIZES, THE CLOUD CREATES THE OPPORTUNITY TO FOCUS ON INNOVATION WHILE LEAVING NON-DIFFERENTIATING ACTIVITIES TO RELIABLE AND COST-EFFECTIVE PROVIDERS. WE ARE DEVOTING SIGNIFICANT RESOURCES TO DEVELOPING CLOUD INFRASTRUCTURE, PLATFORMS, AND\nAPPLICATIONS INCLUDING OFFERINGS SUCH AS MICROSOFT DYNAMICS ONLINE, MICROSOFT SQL AZURE, OFFICE 365, WINDOWS AZURE, WINDOWS INTUNE, AND WINDOWS SERVER.\nECONOMIC CONDITIONS, CHALLENGES, AND RISKS\nAS DISCUSSED ABOVE, OUR INDUSTRY IS DYNAMIC AND HIGHLY COMPETITIVE. WE MUST ANTICIPATE CHANGES IN TECHNOLOGY AND BUSINESS MODELS. OUR MODEL FOR\nGROWTH IS BASED ON OUR ABILITY TO INITIATE AND EMBRACE DISRUPTIVE TECHNOLOGY TRENDS, TO ENTER NEW MARKETS, BOTH IN TERMS OF GEOGRAPHIES AND PRODUCT AREAS, AND TO DRIVE BROAD ADOPTION OF THE PRODUCTS AND SERVICES WE DEVELOP AND MARKET.\nAT MICROSOFT, WE PRIORITIZE OUR INVESTMENTS AMONG THE HIGHEST LONG-TERM GROWTH OPPORTUNITIES. THESE INVESTMENTS REQUIRE SIGNIFICANT RESOURCES AND\nARE MULTI-YEAR IN NATURE. THE PRODUCTS AND SERVICES WE BRING TO MARKET MAY BE DEVELOPED INTERNALLY, BROUGHT TO MARKET AS PART OF A PARTNERSHIP OR ALLIANCE, OR THROUGH ACQUISITION.\nOUR SUCCESS IS HIGHLY DEPENDENT ON OUR ABILITY TO ATTRACT AND RETAIN QUALIFIED EMPLOYEES. WE HIRE A MIX OF UNIVERSITY AND INDUSTRY TALENT\nWORLDWIDE. MICROSOFT COMPETES FOR TALENTED INDIVIDUALS WORLDWIDE BY OFFERING BROAD CUSTOMER REACH, SCALE IN RESOURCES, AND COMPETITIVE COMPENSATION.\nDEMAND FOR OUR SOFTWARE, SERVICES, AND HARDWARE HAS A STRONG CORRELATION TO GLOBAL MACROECONOMIC FACTORS. THE CURRENT MACROECONOMIC FACTORS REMAIN DYNAMIC. SEE A DISCUSSION OF THESE FACTORS AND OTHER RISKS UNDER\nRISK FACTORS (PART II, ITEM 1A. OF THIS FORM 10-K).\nSEASONALITY\nOUR REVENUE HISTORICALLY HAS FLUCTUATED QUARTERLY AND HAS GENERALLY BEEN THE HIGHEST IN THE SECOND QUARTER OF OUR FISCAL YEAR DUE TO CORPORATE CALENDAR YEAR-END SPENDING TRENDS IN OUR MAJOR MARKETS AND HOLIDAY\nSEASON SPENDING\n25\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nPART II\nITEM 7\nBY CONSUMERS. OUR ENTERTAINMENT AND DEVICES DIVISION IS PARTICULARLY SEASONAL AS ITS PRODUCTS ARE AIMED AT THE CONSUMER MARKET AND ARE IN HIGHEST DEMAND DURING THE HOLIDAY SHOPPING SEASON.\nTYPICALLY, THE ENTERTAINMENT AND DEVICES DIVISION HAS GENERATED APPROXIMATELY 40% OF ITS YEARLY SEGMENT REVENUE IN OUR SECOND FISCAL QUARTER.\nUNEARNED REVENUE\nQUARTERLY AND ANNUAL\nREVENUE MAY BE IMPACTED BY THE DEFERRAL OF REVENUE.

IN ADDITION, IN FISCAL YEARS 2012 AND 2011, WE\nRECOGNIZED A REDUCTION OF 21% AND 16%, RESPECTIVELY, TO THE EFFECTIVE TAX RATE DUE TO FOREIGN EARNINGS TAXED AT LOWER RATES. IN FISCAL YEAR 2011, WE SETTLED A PORTION OF AN I.R.S. AUDIT OF TAX YEARS 2004 TO 2006, WHICH REDUCED OUR INCOME TAX EXPENSE\nFOR FISCAL YEAR 2011 BY $461 MILLION AND REDUCED THE EFFECTIVE TAX RATE BY 2%.\nCHANGES IN THE MIX OF INCOME BEFORE INCOME TAXES BETWEEN\nTHE U.S. AND FOREIGN COUNTRIES ALSO IMPACTED OUR EFFECTIVE TAX RATES AND RESULTED PRIMARILY FROM CHANGES IN THE GEOGRAPHIC DISTRIBUTION OF AND CHANGES IN CONSUMER DEMAND FOR OUR PRODUCTS AND SERVICES. AS DISCUSSED ABOVE, WINDOWS DIVISION OPERATING\nINCOME DECLINED $751 MILLION IN FISCAL YEAR 2012, WHILE MBD AND SERVER AND TOOLS OPERATING INCOME INCREASED $1.1 BILLION AND $1.1 BILLION, RESPECTIVELY, DURING THIS SAME PERIOD. WE SUPPLY WINDOWS, OUR PRIMARY WINDOWS DIVISION PRODUCT, TO CUSTOMERS\nTHROUGH OUR U.S. REGIONAL OPERATING CENTER, WHILE WE SUPPLY THE MICROSOFT OFFICE SYSTEM, OUR PRIMARY MBD PRODUCT, AND OUR SERVER AND TOOLS PRODUCTS TO CUSTOMERS THROUGH OUR FOREIGN REGIONAL OPERATIONS CENTERS. IN FISCAL YEARS 2012 AND 2011, OUR U.S.\nINCOME BEFORE INCOME TAXES WAS $1.6 BILLION AND $8.9 BILLION, RESPECTIVELY, AND COMPRISED 7% AND 32%, RESPECTIVELY, OF OUR INCOME BEFORE INCOME TAXES. IN FISCAL YEARS 2012 AND 2011, THE FOREIGN INCOME BEFORE INCOME TAXES WAS $20.7 BILLION AND $19.2\nBILLION, RESPECTIVELY, AND COMPRISED 93% AND 68%, RESPECTIVELY, OF OUR INCOME BEFORE INCOME TAXES. THE PRIMARY DRIVER FOR THE DECREASE IN THE U.S. INCOME BEFORE INCOME TAX IN FISCAL YEAR 2012 WAS THE GOODWILL IMPAIRMENT CHARGE.\nTAX CONTINGENCIES AND OTHER TAX LIABILITIES WERE $7.6 BILLION AND $7.4 BILLION AS OF JUNE 30, 2012 AND 2011, RESPECTIVELY, AND ARE INCLUDED IN\nOTHER LONG-TERM LIABILITIES. WHILE WE SETTLED A PORTION OF THE I.R.S. AUDIT FOR TAX YEARS 2004 TO 2006 DURING THE THIRD QUARTER OF FISCAL YEAR 2011, WE REMAIN UNDER AUDIT FOR THESE YEARS. IN FEBRUARY 2012, THE I.R.S. WITHDREW ITS 2011 REVENUE AGENTS\nREPORT AND REOPENED THE AUDIT PHASE OF THE EXAMINATION. AS OF JUNE 30, 2012, THE PRIMARY UNRESOLVED ISSUE RELATES TO TRANSFER PRICING WHICH COULD HAVE A SIGNIFICANT IMPACT ON OUR FINANCIAL STATEMENTS IF NOT RESOLVED FAVORABLY. WE BELIEVE OUR\nALLOWANCES FOR TAX CONTINGENCIES ARE APPROPRIATE. WE DO NOT BELIEVE IT IS REASONABLY POSSIBLE THAT THE TOTAL AMOUNT OF UNRECOGNIZED TAX BENEFITS WILL SIGNIFICANTLY INCREASE OR DECREASE WITHIN THE NEXT 12 MONTHS, AS WE DO NOT BELIEVE THE REMAINING\nOPEN ISSUES WILL BE RESOLVED WITHIN THE NEXT 12 MONTHS. WE ALSO CONTINUE TO BE SUBJECT TO EXAMINATION BY THE I.R.S. FOR TAX YEARS 2007 TO 2011.\nFISCAL YEAR 2011 COMPARED WITH FISCAL YEAR 2010\nOUR EFFECTIVE TAX RATES FOR FISCAL YEARS 2011 AND 2010 WERE APPROXIMATELY 18% AND 25%, RESPECTIVELY. OUR EFFECTIVE TAX RATE WAS LOWER THAN THE U.S. FEDERAL STATUTORY RATE AND OUR PRIOR YEAR EFFECTIVE RATE PRIMARILY\nDUE TO A HIGHER MIX OF EARNINGS TAXED AT LOWER RATES IN FOREIGN JURISDICTIONS RESULTING FROM PRODUCING AND DISTRIBUTING OUR PRODUCTS AND SERVICES THROUGH OUR FOREIGN REGIONAL OPERATIONS CENTERS IN IRELAND, SINGAPORE, AND PUERTO RICO, WHICH HAVE\nLOWER INCOME TAX RATES. IN FISCAL YEARS 2011 AND 2010, OUR U.S. INCOME BEFORE INCOME TAXES WAS $8.9 BILLION AND $9.6 BILLION, RESPECTIVELY, AND COMPRISED 32% AND 38%, RESPECTIVELY, OF OUR INCOME BEFORE INCOME TAXES. IN FISCAL YEARS 2011\nAND 2010, THE FOREIGN INCOME BEFORE INCOME TAXES WAS $19.2 BILLION AND $15.4 BILLION, RESPECTIVELY, AND COMPRISED 68% AND 62%, RESPECTIVELY, OF OUR INCOME BEFORE INCOME TAXES. IN FISCAL YEARS 2011 AND 2010, THE REDUCTION OF THE U.S. FEDERAL\nSTATUTORY RATE AS A RESULT OF FOREIGN EARNINGS TAXED AT LOWER RATES WAS 16% AND 12%, RESPECTIVELY.\n35\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nPART II\nITEM 7\nIN ADDITION, OUR EFFECTIVE TAX RATE WAS LOWER THAN IN THE PRIOR YEAR DUE TO A PARTIAL SETTLEMENT\nWITH THE I.R.S. IN THE THIRD QUARTER OF FISCAL YEAR 2011 RELATING TO THE AUDIT OF TAX YEARS 2004 TO 2006. THIS PARTIAL SETTLEMENT REDUCED OUR INCOME TAX EXPENSE FOR FISCAL YEAR 2011 BY $461 MILLION.\nFINANCIAL CONDITION\nCASH, CASH\nEQUIVALENTS, AND INVESTMENTS\nCASH, CASH EQUIVALENTS, AND SHORT-TERM INVESTMENTS TOTALED $63.0 BILLION AS OF JUNE 30, 2012,\nCOMPARED WITH $52.8 BILLION AS OF JUNE 30, 2011. EQUITY AND OTHER INVESTMENTS WERE $9.8 BILLION AS OF JUNE 30, 2012, COMPARED WITH $10.9 BILLION AS OF JUNE 30, 2011. OUR SHORT-TERM INVESTMENTS ARE PRIMARILY TO FACILITATE LIQUIDITY AND\nFOR CAPITAL PRESERVATION. THEY CONSIST PREDOMINANTLY OF HIGHLY LIQUID INVESTMENT-GRADE FIXED-INCOME SECURITIES, DIVERSIFIED AMONG INDUSTRIES AND INDIVIDUAL ISSUERS. THE INVESTMENTS ARE PREDOMINANTLY U.S. DOLLAR-DENOMINATED SECURITIES, BUT ALSO\nINCLUDE FOREIGN CURRENCY-DENOMINATED SECURITIES IN ORDER TO DIVERSIFY RISK. OUR FIXED-INCOME INVESTMENTS ARE EXPOSED TO INTEREST RATE RISK AND CREDIT RISK. THE CREDIT RISK AND AVERAGE MATURITY OF OUR FIXED-INCOME PORTFOLIO ARE MANAGED TO ACHIEVE\nECONOMIC RETURNS THAT CORRELATE TO CERTAIN FIXED-INCOME INDICES. THE SETTLEMENT RISK RELATED TO THESE INVESTMENTS IS INSIGNIFICANT GIVEN THAT THE SHORT-TERM INVESTMENTS HELD ARE PRIMARILY HIGHLY LIQUID INVESTMENT-GRADE FIXED-INCOME SECURITIES. WHILE\nWE OWN CERTAIN MORTGAGE-BACKED AND ASSET-BACKED FIXED-INCOME SECURITIES, OUR PORTFOLIO AS OF JUNE 30, 2012 DOES NOT CONTAIN DIRECT EXPOSURE TO SUBPRIME MORTGAGES OR STRUCTURED VEHICLES THAT DERIVE THEIR VALUE FROM SUBPRIME COLLATERAL. THE\nMAJORITY OF OUR MORTGAGE-BACKED SECURITIES ARE COLLATERALIZED BY PRIME RESIDENTIAL MORTGAGES AND CARRY A 100% PRINCIPAL AND INTEREST GUARANTEE, PRIMARILY FROM FEDERAL NATIONAL MORTGAGE ASSOCIATION, FEDERAL HOME LOAN MORTGAGE CORPORATION, AND\nGOVERNMENT NATIONAL MORTGAGE ASSOCIATION.\nWE ROUTINELY MONITOR OUR FINANCIAL EXPOSURE TO BOTH SOVEREIGN AND NON-SOVEREIGN BORROWERS AND\nCOUNTERPARTIES. OUR GROSS EXPOSURES TO OUR CUSTOMERS AND INVESTMENTS IN PORTUGAL, ITALY, IRELAND, GREECE, AND SPAIN ARE INDIVIDUALLY AND COLLECTIVELY NOT MATERIAL.\nOF THE CASH, CASH EQUIVALENTS, AND SHORT-TERM INVESTMENTS AT JUNE 30, 2012, APPROXIMATELY $54 BILLION WAS HELD BY OUR FOREIGN SUBSIDIARIES AND WOULD BE SUBJECT TO MATERIAL REPATRIATION TAX EFFECTS. THE AMOUNT\nOF CASH AND INVESTMENTS HELD BY FOREIGN SUBSIDIARIES SUBJECT TO OTHER RESTRICTIONS ON THE FREE FLOW OF FUNDS (PRIMARILY CURRENCY AND OTHER LOCAL REGULATORY) WAS APPROXIMATELY $660 MILLION. AS OF JUNE 30, 2012, APPROXIMATELY 77% OF THE\nSHORT-TERM INVESTMENTS HELD BY OUR FOREIGN SUBSIDIARIES WERE INVESTED IN U.S. GOVERNMENT AND AGENCY SECURITIES, APPROXIMATELY 10% WERE INVESTED IN CORPORATE NOTES AND BONDS OF U.S. COMPANIES, AND 3% WERE INVESTED IN U.S. MORTGAGE-BACKED SECURITIES,\nALL OF WHICH ARE DENOMINATED IN U.S. DOLLARS.\nSECURITIES LENDING\nWE LEND CERTAIN FIXED-INCOME AND EQUITY SECURITIES TO INCREASE INVESTMENT RETURNS. THE LOANED SECURITIES CONTINUE TO BE CARRIED AS INVESTMENTS ON OUR BALANCE SHEET. CASH AND\/OR SECURITY INTERESTS ARE RECEIVED AS\nCOLLATERAL FOR THE LOANED SECURITIES WITH THE AMOUNT DETERMINED BASED UPON THE UNDERLYING SECURITY LENT AND THE CREDITWORTHINESS OF THE BORROWER. CASH RECEIVED IS RECORDED AS AN ASSET WITH A CORRESPONDING LIABILITY. OUR SECURITIES LENDING PAYABLE\nBALANCE WAS $814 MILLION AS OF JUNE 30, 2012. OUR AVERAGE AND MAXIMUM SECURITIES LENDING PAYABLE BALANCES FOR THE FISCAL YEAR WERE $1.2 BILLION AND $1.4 BILLION, RESPECTIVELY. INTRA-YEAR VARIANCES IN THE AMOUNT OF SECURITIES LOANED ARE MAINLY\nDUE TO FLUCTUATIONS IN THE DEMAND FOR THE SECURITIES.\nVALUATION\nIN GENERAL, AND WHERE APPLICABLE, WE USE QUOTED PRICES IN ACTIVE MARKETS FOR IDENTICAL ASSETS OR LIABILITIES TO DETERMINE THE FAIR VALUE OF OUR FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS. THIS PRICING METHODOLOGY APPLIES TO OUR LEVEL 1\nINVESTMENTS, SUCH AS EXCHANGE-TRADED MUTUAL FUNDS, DOMESTIC AND INTERNATIONAL EQUITIES, AND U.S. TREASURIES. IF QUOTED PRICES IN ACTIVE MARKETS FOR IDENTICAL ASSETS OR LIABILITIES ARE NOT AVAILABLE TO DETERMINE FAIR VALUE, THEN WE USE QUOTED PRICES\nFOR SIMILAR ASSETS AND LIABILITIES OR INPUTS OTHER THAN THE QUOTED PRICES THAT ARE OBSERVABLE EITHER DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY. THIS PRICING METHODOLOGY APPLIES TO OUR LEVEL 2 INVESTMENTS SUCH AS CORPORATE NOTES AND BONDS, FOREIGN GOVERNMENT\n36\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nPART II\nITEM 7\nBONDS, MORTGAGE-BACKED SECURITIES, AND AGENCY SECURITIES. LEVEL 3 INVESTMENTS ARE VALUED USING INTERNALLY DEVELOPED MODELS WITH UNOBSERVABLE INPUTS. ASSETS AND LIABILITIES MEASURED USING\nUNOBSERVABLE INPUTS ARE AN IMMATERIAL PORTION OF OUR PORTFOLIO.\nA MAJORITY OF OUR INVESTMENTS ARE PRICED BY PRICING VENDORS AND ARE\nGENERALLY LEVEL 1 OR LEVEL 2 INVESTMENTS AS THESE VENDORS EITHER PROVIDE A QUOTED MARKET PRICE IN AN ACTIVE MARKET OR USE OBSERVABLE INPUTS FOR THEIR PRICING WITHOUT APPLYING SIGNIFICANT ADJUSTMENTS. BROKER PRICING IS USED MAINLY WHEN A QUOTED PRICE\nIS NOT AVAILABLE, THE INVESTMENT IS NOT PRICED BY OUR PRICING VENDORS, OR WHEN A BROKER PRICE IS MORE REFLECTIVE OF FAIR VALUES IN THE MARKET IN WHICH THE INVESTMENT TRADES. OUR BROKER-PRICED INVESTMENTS ARE GENERALLY LABELED AS LEVEL 2 INVESTMENTS\nBECAUSE THE BROKER PRICES THESE INVESTMENTS BASED ON SIMILAR ASSETS WITHOUT APPLYING SIGNIFICANT ADJUSTMENTS. IN ADDITION, ALL OF OUR BROKER-PRICED INVESTMENTS HAVE A SUFFICIENT LEVEL OF TRADING VOLUME TO DEMONSTRATE THAT THE FAIR VALUES USED ARE\nAPPROPRIATE FOR THESE INVESTMENTS. OUR FAIR VALUE PROCESSES INCLUDE CONTROLS THAT ARE DESIGNED TO ENSURE APPROPRIATE FAIR VALUES ARE RECORDED. THESE CONTROLS INCLUDE MODEL VALIDATION, REVIEW OF KEY MODEL INPUTS, ANALYSIS OF PERIOD-OVER-PERIOD\nFLUCTUATIONS, AND INDEPENDENT RECALCULATION OF PRICES WHERE APPROPRIATE.\nCASH FLOWS\nFISCAL YEAR 2012 COMPARED WITH FISCAL YEAR 2011\nCASH FLOWS FROM OPERATIONS INCREASED $4.6\nBILLION DURING THE CURRENT FISCAL YEAR TO $31.6 BILLION DUE MAINLY TO INCREASED REVENUE AND CASH COLLECTIONS FROM CUSTOMERS. CASH USED FOR FINANCING INCREASED $1.0 BILLION TO $9.4 BILLION DUE MAINLY TO A $6.0 BILLION NET DECREASE IN PROCEEDS FROM\nISSUANCES OF DEBT AND A $1.2 BILLION INCREASE IN DIVIDENDS PAID, OFFSET IN PART BY A $6.5 BILLION DECREASE IN CASH USED FOR COMMON STOCK REPURCHASES. CASH USED IN INVESTING INCREASED $10.2 BILLION TO $24.8 BILLION DUE MAINLY TO A $10.0 BILLION\nINCREASE IN ACQUISITIONS OF BUSINESSES AND PURCHASES OF INTANGIBLE ASSETS AND A $1.4 BILLION DECREASE IN CASH FROM SECURITIES LENDING ACTIVITIES, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY A $1.2 BILLION DECREASE IN CASH USED FOR NET PURCHASES, MATURITIES, AND SALES OF\nINVESTMENTS.\nFISCAL YEAR 2011 COMPARED WITH FISCAL YEAR 2010\nCASH FLOWS FROM OPERATIONS INCREASED $2.9 BILLION DURING THE CURRENT FISCAL YEAR TO $27.0 BILLION DUE MAINLY TO INCREASED REVENUE AND CASH COLLECTIONS FROM CUSTOMERS. CASH USED IN FINANCING DECREASED $4.9 BILLION\nTO $8.4 BILLION DUE MAINLY TO A $5.8 BILLION INCREASE IN PROCEEDS FROM ISSUANCE OF DEBT, NET OF REPAYMENTS, OFFSET IN PART BY A $602 MILLION INCREASE IN CASH PAID FOR DIVIDENDS. CASH USED IN INVESTING INCREASED $3.3 BILLION TO $14.6 BILLION DUE TO A\n$5.8 BILLION INCREASE IN PURCHASES OF INVESTMENTS, OFFSET IN PART BY A $2.5 BILLION INCREASE IN CASH FROM SECURITIES LENDING.\nDEBT\nWE ISSUED DEBT IN PRIOR PERIODS TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF FAVORABLE PRICING AND LIQUIDITY IN THE DEBT MARKETS, REFLECTING OUR CREDIT RATING AND THE LOW\nINTEREST RATE ENVIRONMENT. THE PROCEEDS OF THESE ISSUANCES WERE USED TO PARTIALLY FUND DISCRETIONARY BUSINESS ACQUISITIONS AND SHARE REPURCHASES.\nAS OF JUNE 30, 2012, THE TOTAL CARRYING VALUE AND ESTIMATED FAIR VALUE OF OUR LONG-TERM DEBT, INCLUDING THE CURRENT PORTION, WERE $11.9 BILLION AND $13.2 BILLION, RESPECTIVELY. THIS IS COMPARED WITH A CARRYING\nVALUE AND ESTIMATED FAIR VALUE OF $11.9 BILLION AND $12.1 BILLION, RESPECTIVELY, AS OF JUNE 30, 2011. THESE ESTIMATED FAIR VALUES ARE BASED ON LEVEL 2 INPUTS.\n37\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nPART II\nITEM 7\nTHE COMPONENTS OF OUR LONG-TERM DEBT, INCLUDING THE CURRENT PORTION, AND THE ASSOCIATED INTEREST\nRATES AND SEMI-ANNUAL INTEREST RECORD AND PAYMENT DATES WERE AS FOLLOWS AS OF JUNE 30, 2012.\nDUE DATE\nFACE VALUE\nSTATED\nINTEREST\nRATE\nEFFECTIVE\nINTEREST\nRATE\nINTEREST\nRECORD DATE\nINTEREST\nPAY DATE\nINTEREST\nRECORD DATE\nINTEREST\nPAY DATE\n(IN MILLIONS)\nNOTES\nSEPTEMBER 27, 2013\n$1,000\n0.875%\n1.000%\nMARCH 15\nMARCH 27\nSEPTEMBER 15\nSEPTEMBER 27\nJUNE 1, 2014\n2,000\n2.950%\n3.049%\nMAY 15\nJUNE 1\nNOVEMBER 15\nDECEMBER 1\nSEPTEMBER 25, 2015\n1,750\n1.625%\n1.795%\nMARCH 15\nMARCH 25\nSEPTEMBER 15\nSEPTEMBER 25\nFEBRUARY 8, 2016\n750\n2.500%\n2.642%\nFEBRUARY 1\nFEBRUARY 8\nAUGUST 1\nAUGUST 8\nJUNE 1, 2019\n1,000\n4.200%\n4.379%\nMAY 15\nJUNE 1\nNOVEMBER 15\nDECEMBER 1\nOCTOBER 1, 2020\n1,000\n3.000%\n3.137%\nMARCH 15\nAPRIL 1\nSEPTEMBER 15\nOCTOBER 1\nFEBRUARY 8, 2021\n500\n4.000%\n4.082%\nFEBRUARY 1\nFEBRUARY 8\nAUGUST 1\nAUGUST 8\nJUNE 1, 2039\n750\n5.200%\n5.240%\nMAY 15\nJUNE 1\nNOVEMBER 15\nDECEMBER 1\nOCTOBER 1, 2040\n1,000\n4.500%\n4.567%\nMARCH 15\nAPRIL 1\nSEPTEMBER 15\nOCTOBER 1\nFEBRUARY 8, 2041\n1,000\n5.300%\n5.361%\nFEBRUARY 1\nFEBRUARY 8\nAUGUST 1\nAUGUST 8\nTOTAL\n10,750\nCONVERTIBLE DEBT\nJUNE 15, 2013\n1,250\n0.000%\n1.849%\nTOTAL FACE VALUE\n$12,000\nAS OF JUNE 30, 2012, THE AGGREGATE UNAMORTIZED DISCOUNT FOR OUR LONG-TERM DEBT, INCLUDING THE CURRENT PORTION,\nWAS $56 MILLION.\nNOTES\nTHE\nNOTES ARE SENIOR UNSECURED OBLIGATIONS AND RANK EQUALLY WITH OUR OTHER UNSECURED AND UNSUBORDINATED DEBT OUTSTANDING.\nCONVERTIBLE DEBT\nIN JUNE 2010, WE ISSUED $1.25 BILLION OF ZERO COUPON CONVERTIBLE UNSECURED DEBT DUE ON JUNE 15, 2013 IN A PRIVATE PLACEMENT\nOFFERING. PROCEEDS FROM THE OFFERING WERE $1.24 BILLION, NET OF FEES AND EXPENSES, WHICH WERE CAPITALIZED. INITIALLY, EACH $1,000 PRINCIPAL AMOUNT OF NOTES WAS CONVERTIBLE INTO 29.94 SHARES OF MICROSOFT COMMON STOCK AT A CONVERSION PRICE OF $33.40\nPER SHARE. THE CONVERSION RATIO IS ADJUSTED PERIODICALLY FOR DIVIDENDS IN EXCESS OF THE INITIAL DIVIDEND THRESHOLD AS DEFINED IN THE DEBT AGREEMENT. AS OF JUNE 30, 2012, THE NET CARRYING AMOUNT OF OUR CONVERTIBLE DEBT WAS $1.2 BILLION AND THE\nUNAMORTIZED DISCOUNT WAS $19 MILLION.\nPRIOR TO MARCH 15, 2013, THE NOTES WILL BE CONVERTIBLE, ONLY IN CERTAIN CIRCUMSTANCES, INTO\nCASH AND, IF APPLICABLE, CASH, SHARES OF MICROSOFT\u0092S COMMON STOCK, OR A COMBINATION THEREOF, AT OUR ELECTION. ON OR AFTER MARCH 15, 2013, THE NOTES WILL BE CONVERTIBLE AT ANY TIME. UPON CONVERSION, WE WILL PAY CASH UP TO THE AGGREGATE\nPRINCIPAL AMOUNT OF THE NOTES AND PAY OR DELIVER CASH, SHARES OF OUR COMMON STOCK, OR A COMBINATION OF CASH AND SHARES OF OUR COMMON STOCK, AT OUR ELECTION.\nBECAUSE THE CONVERTIBLE DEBT MAY BE WHOLLY OR PARTIALLY SETTLED IN CASH, WE ARE REQUIRED TO SEPARATELY ACCOUNT FOR THE LIABILITY AND EQUITY COMPONENTS OF THE NOTES IN A MANNER THAT REFLECTS OUR NONCONVERTIBLE DEBT\nBORROWING RATE WHEN INTEREST COSTS ARE RECOGNIZED IN SUBSEQUENT PERIODS.

IN ADDITION, WE EXPECT EXISTING FOREIGN CASH, CASH EQUIVALENTS, SHORT-TERM INVESTMENTS, AND\nCASH FLOWS FROM OPERATIONS TO CONTINUE TO BE SUFFICIENT TO FUND OUR FOREIGN OPERATING ACTIVITIES AND CASH COMMITMENTS FOR INVESTING ACTIVITIES, SUCH AS MATERIAL CAPITAL EXPENDITURES, FOR AT LEAST THE NEXT 12 MONTHS AND THEREAFTER FOR THE FORESEEABLE\nFUTURE.\nSHOULD WE REQUIRE MORE CAPITAL IN THE U.S. THAN IS GENERATED BY OUR OPERATIONS DOMESTICALLY, FOR EXAMPLE TO FUND SIGNIFICANT\nDISCRETIONARY ACTIVITIES, SUCH AS BUSINESS ACQUISITIONS AND SHARE REPURCHASES, WE COULD ELECT TO REPATRIATE FUTURE EARNINGS FROM FOREIGN JURISDICTIONS OR RAISE CAPITAL IN THE U.S. THROUGH DEBT OR EQUITY ISSUANCES. THESE ALTERNATIVES COULD RESULT IN\nHIGHER EFFECTIVE TAX RATES, INCREASED INTEREST EXPENSE, OR DILUTION OF OUR EARNINGS. WE HAVE BORROWED FUNDS DOMESTICALLY AND CONTINUE TO BELIEVE WE HAVE THE ABILITY TO DO SO AT REASONABLE INTEREST RATES.\nRECENT ACCOUNTING GUIDANCE\nRECENTLY\nADOPTED ACCOUNTING GUIDANCE\nON JULY 1, 2011, WE ADOPTED GUIDANCE ISSUED BY THE FINANCIAL ACCOUNTING STANDARDS BOARD\n(\u0093FASB\u0094) ON DISCLOSURE REQUIREMENTS RELATED TO FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS. THE GUIDANCE REQUIRES THE DISCLOSURE OF ROLL-FORWARD ACTIVITIES ON PURCHASES, SALES, ISSUANCES, AND SETTLEMENTS OF THE ASSETS AND LIABILITIES MEASURED USING\nSIGNIFICANT UNOBSERVABLE INPUTS (LEVEL 3 FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS). ADOPTION OF THIS NEW GUIDANCE DID NOT HAVE A MATERIAL IMPACT ON OUR FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.\nON JANUARY 1, 2012, WE ADOPTED GUIDANCE ISSUED BY THE FASB ON ACCOUNTING AND DISCLOSURE REQUIREMENTS RELATED TO FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS. THE GUIDANCE LIMITS THE HIGHEST-AND-BEST-USE MEASURE TO\nNONFINANCIAL ASSETS, PERMITS CERTAIN FINANCIAL ASSETS AND LIABILITIES WITH OFFSETTING POSITIONS IN MARKET OR COUNTERPARTY CREDIT RISKS TO BE MEASURED AT A NET BASIS, AND PROVIDES GUIDANCE ON THE APPLICABILITY OF PREMIUMS AND\nDISCOUNTS. ADDITIONALLY, THE GUIDANCE EXPANDS THE DISCLOSURES ON LEVEL 3 INPUTS BY REQUIRING QUANTITATIVE DISCLOSURE OF THE UNOBSERVABLE INPUTS AND ASSUMPTIONS, AS WELL AS DESCRIPTION OF THE VALUATION PROCESSES AND THE SENSITIVITY OF THE FAIR\nVALUE TO CHANGES IN UNOBSERVABLE INPUTS. ADOPTION OF THIS NEW GUIDANCE DID NOT HAVE A MATERIAL IMPACT ON OUR FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.\nRECENT\nACCOUNTING GUIDANCE NOT YET ADOPTED\nIN DECEMBER 2011, THE FASB ISSUED GUIDANCE ENHANCING DISCLOSURE REQUIREMENTS ABOUT THE NATURE\nOF AN ENTITY\u0092S RIGHT TO OFFSET AND RELATED ARRANGEMENTS ASSOCIATED WITH ITS FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS AND DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS. THE NEW GUIDANCE REQUIRES THE DISCLOSURE OF THE GROSS AMOUNTS SUBJECT TO RIGHTS OF SET-OFF, AMOUNTS OFFSET IN\nACCORDANCE WITH THE ACCOUNTING STANDARDS FOLLOWED, AND THE RELATED NET EXPOSURE. THE NEW GUIDANCE WILL BE EFFECTIVE FOR US BEGINNING JULY 1, 2013. OTHER THAN REQUIRING ADDITIONAL DISCLOSURES, WE DO NOT ANTICIPATE MATERIAL IMPACTS ON OUR\nFINANCIAL STATEMENTS UPON ADOPTION.\nIN SEPTEMBER 2011, THE FASB ISSUED GUIDANCE ON TESTING GOODWILL FOR IMPAIRMENT. THE NEW GUIDANCE\nPROVIDES AN ENTITY THE OPTION TO FIRST PERFORM A QUALITATIVE ASSESSMENT TO DETERMINE WHETHER IT IS MORE LIKELY THAN NOT THAT THE FAIR VALUE OF A REPORTING UNIT IS LESS THAN ITS CARRYING AMOUNT. IF AN ENTITY DETERMINES THAT THIS IS THE CASE, IT IS\nREQUIRED TO PERFORM THE CURRENTLY PRESCRIBED TWO-STEP GOODWILL IMPAIRMENT TEST TO IDENTIFY POTENTIAL GOODWILL IMPAIRMENT AND MEASURE THE AMOUNT OF GOODWILL IMPAIRMENT LOSS TO BE RECOGNIZED FOR THAT REPORTING UNIT (IF ANY). IF AN ENTITY DETERMINES\nTHAT THE FAIR VALUE OF A REPORTING UNIT IS GREATER THAN ITS CARRYING AMOUNT, THE TWO-STEP GOODWILL IMPAIRMENT TEST IS NOT REQUIRED. THE NEW GUIDANCE WILL BE EFFECTIVE FOR US BEGINNING JULY 1, 2012.\nIN JUNE 2011, THE FASB ISSUED GUIDANCE ON PRESENTATION OF COMPREHENSIVE INCOME. THE NEW GUIDANCE ELIMINATES THE CURRENT OPTION TO REPORT OTHER\nCOMPREHENSIVE INCOME AND ITS COMPONENTS IN THE STATEMENT OF CHANGES IN STOCKHOLDERS\u0092 EQUITY. INSTEAD, AN ENTITY WILL BE REQUIRED TO PRESENT EITHER A CONTINUOUS STATEMENT OF NET INCOME AND\n41\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nPART II\nITEM 7\nOTHER COMPREHENSIVE INCOME OR IN TWO SEPARATE BUT CONSECUTIVE STATEMENTS. THIS PORTION OF THE GUIDANCE WILL BE EFFECTIVE FOR US BEGINNING JULY 1, 2012 AND WILL REQUIRE FINANCIAL\nSTATEMENT PRESENTATION CHANGES ONLY. THE NEW GUIDANCE ALSO REQUIRED ENTITIES TO PRESENT RECLASSIFICATION ADJUSTMENTS OUT OF ACCUMULATED OTHER COMPREHENSIVE INCOME BY COMPONENT IN BOTH THE STATEMENT IN WHICH NET INCOME IS PRESENTED AND THE STATEMENT\nIN WHICH OTHER COMPREHENSIVE INCOME IS PRESENTED. HOWEVER, IN DECEMBER 2011, THE FASB ISSUED GUIDANCE THAT INDEFINITELY DEFERS THE GUIDANCE RELATED TO THE PRESENTATION OF RECLASSIFICATION ADJUSTMENTS.\nAPPLICATION OF CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES\nOUR FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND ACCOMPANYING NOTES ARE PREPARED IN ACCORDANCE WITH U.S. GAAP. PREPARING FINANCIAL STATEMENTS REQUIRES MANAGEMENT TO MAKE ESTIMATES AND ASSUMPTIONS THAT AFFECT THE REPORTED AMOUNTS OF\nASSETS, LIABILITIES, REVENUE, AND EXPENSES. THESE ESTIMATES AND ASSUMPTIONS ARE AFFECTED BY MANAGEMENT\u0092S APPLICATION OF ACCOUNTING POLICIES. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES FOR US INCLUDE REVENUE RECOGNITION, IMPAIRMENT OF INVESTMENT SECURITIES,\nGOODWILL, RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT COSTS, CONTINGENCIES, INCOME TAXES, AND STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION.\nREVENUE RECOGNITION\nSOFTWARE REVENUE RECOGNITION REQUIRES JUDGMENT, INCLUDING WHETHER A SOFTWARE ARRANGEMENT INCLUDES MULTIPLE ELEMENTS, AND IF SO, WHETHER\nVENDOR-SPECIFIC OBJECTIVE EVIDENCE (\u0093VSOE\u0094) OF FAIR VALUE EXISTS FOR THOSE ELEMENTS. A PORTION OF REVENUE MAY BE RECORDED AS UNEARNED DUE TO UNDELIVERED ELEMENTS. CHANGES TO THE ELEMENTS IN A SOFTWARE ARRANGEMENT, THE ABILITY TO IDENTIFY\nVSOE FOR THOSE ELEMENTS, AND THE FAIR VALUE OF THE RESPECTIVE ELEMENTS COULD MATERIALLY IMPACT THE AMOUNT OF EARNED AND UNEARNED REVENUE. JUDGMENT IS ALSO REQUIRED TO ASSESS WHETHER FUTURE RELEASES OF CERTAIN SOFTWARE REPRESENT NEW PRODUCTS OR\nUPGRADES AND ENHANCEMENTS TO EXISTING PRODUCTS.\nWINDOWS 7 REVENUE IS SUBJECT TO DEFERRAL AS A RESULT OF THE WINDOWS UPGRADE OFFER,\nWHICH STARTED JUNE 2, 2012. THE OFFER PROVIDES SIGNIFICANTLY DISCOUNTED RIGHTS TO PURCHASE WINDOWS 8 PRO TO QUALIFYING END USERS THAT PURCHASE WINDOWS 7 PCS DURING THE ELIGIBILITY PERIOD. MICROSOFT IS RESPONSIBLE FOR DELIVERING WINDOWS 8 PRO TO\nTHE END CUSTOMER. ACCORDINGLY, REVENUE RELATED TO THE ALLOCATED DISCOUNT FOR UNDELIVERED WINDOWS 8 IS DEFERRED UNTIL IT IS DELIVERED OR THE REDEMPTION PERIOD EXPIRES.\nIMPAIRMENT OF INVESTMENT SECURITIES\nWE REVIEW INVESTMENTS QUARTERLY FOR INDICATORS OF\nOTHER-THAN-TEMPORARY IMPAIRMENT. THIS DETERMINATION REQUIRES SIGNIFICANT JUDGMENT. IN MAKING THIS JUDGMENT, WE EMPLOY A SYSTEMATIC METHODOLOGY QUARTERLY THAT CONSIDERS AVAILABLE QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE EVIDENCE IN EVALUATING POTENTIAL\nIMPAIRMENT OF OUR INVESTMENTS. IF THE COST OF AN INVESTMENT EXCEEDS ITS FAIR VALUE, WE EVALUATE, AMONG OTHER FACTORS, GENERAL MARKET CONDITIONS, CREDIT QUALITY OF DEBT INSTRUMENT ISSUERS, THE DURATION AND EXTENT TO WHICH THE FAIR VALUE IS LESS THAN\nCOST, AND FOR EQUITY SECURITIES, OUR INTENT AND ABILITY TO HOLD, OR PLANS TO SELL, THE INVESTMENT. FOR FIXED-INCOME SECURITIES, WE ALSO EVALUATE WHETHER WE HAVE PLANS TO SELL THE SECURITY OR IT IS MORE LIKELY THAN NOT THAT WE WILL BE REQUIRED TO\nSELL THE SECURITY BEFORE RECOVERY. WE ALSO CONSIDER SPECIFIC ADVERSE CONDITIONS RELATED TO THE FINANCIAL HEALTH OF AND BUSINESS OUTLOOK FOR THE INVESTEE, INCLUDING INDUSTRY AND SECTOR PERFORMANCE, CHANGES IN TECHNOLOGY, AND OPERATIONAL AND FINANCING\nCASH FLOW FACTORS. ONCE A DECLINE IN FAIR VALUE IS DETERMINED TO BE OTHER-THAN-TEMPORARY, AN IMPAIRMENT CHARGE IS RECORDED TO OTHER INCOME (EXPENSE) AND A NEW COST BASIS IN THE INVESTMENT IS ESTABLISHED. IF MARKET, INDUSTRY, AND\/OR INVESTEE\nCONDITIONS DETERIORATE, WE MAY INCUR FUTURE IMPAIRMENTS.\nGOODWILL\nWE ALLOCATE GOODWILL TO REPORTING UNITS BASED ON THE REPORTING UNIT EXPECTED TO BENEFIT FROM THE BUSINESS COMBINATION. WE EVALUATE OUR REPORTING UNITS ON AN ANNUAL BASIS AND, IF NECESSARY, REASSIGN GOODWILL USING A\nRELATIVE FAIR VALUE ALLOCATION APPROACH. GOODWILL IS TESTED FOR IMPAIRMENT AT THE REPORTING UNIT LEVEL (OPERATING SEGMENT OR ONE LEVEL BELOW AN OPERATING SEGMENT) ON AN ANNUAL BASIS (MAY 1 FOR US) AND BETWEEN ANNUAL TESTS IF AN EVENT OCCURS OR\nCIRCUMSTANCES CHANGE THAT WOULD MORE LIKELY THAN NOT REDUCE THE FAIR VALUE OF A REPORTING UNIT BELOW ITS CARRYING VALUE. THESE EVENTS OR CIRCUMSTANCES COULD INCLUDE A SIGNIFICANT CHANGE IN THE BUSINESS CLIMATE, LEGAL FACTORS, OPERATING PERFORMANCE\nINDICATORS, COMPETITION, OR SALE OR DISPOSITION OF A SIGNIFICANT PORTION OF A REPORTING UNIT.\n42\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nPART II\nITEM 7\nAPPLICATION OF THE GOODWILL IMPAIRMENT TEST REQUIRES JUDGMENT, INCLUDING THE IDENTIFICATION OF\nREPORTING UNITS, ASSIGNMENT OF ASSETS AND LIABILITIES TO REPORTING UNITS, ASSIGNMENT OF GOODWILL TO REPORTING UNITS, AND DETERMINATION OF THE FAIR VALUE OF EACH REPORTING UNIT. THE FAIR VALUE OF EACH REPORTING UNIT IS ESTIMATED USING A DISCOUNTED\nCASH FLOW METHODOLOGY. THIS ANALYSIS REQUIRES SIGNIFICANT JUDGMENTS, INCLUDING ESTIMATION OF FUTURE CASH FLOWS, WHICH IS DEPENDENT ON INTERNAL FORECASTS, ESTIMATION OF THE LONG-TERM RATE OF GROWTH FOR OUR BUSINESS, ESTIMATION OF THE USEFUL LIFE OVER\nWHICH CASH FLOWS WILL OCCUR, AND DETERMINATION OF OUR WEIGHTED AVERAGE COST OF CAPITAL.\nTHE ESTIMATES USED TO CALCULATE THE FAIR VALUE\nOF A REPORTING UNIT CHANGE FROM YEAR TO YEAR BASED ON OPERATING RESULTS, MARKET CONDITIONS, AND OTHER FACTORS. CHANGES IN THESE ESTIMATES AND ASSUMPTIONS COULD MATERIALLY AFFECT THE DETERMINATION OF FAIR VALUE AND GOODWILL IMPAIRMENT FOR EACH\nREPORTING UNIT.\nRESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT COSTS\nCOSTS INCURRED INTERNALLY IN RESEARCHING AND DEVELOPING A COMPUTER SOFTWARE PRODUCT ARE CHARGED TO EXPENSE UNTIL TECHNOLOGICAL FEASIBILITY HAS BEEN ESTABLISHED FOR THE PRODUCT. ONCE TECHNOLOGICAL FEASIBILITY IS\nESTABLISHED, ALL SOFTWARE COSTS ARE CAPITALIZED UNTIL THE PRODUCT IS AVAILABLE FOR GENERAL RELEASE TO CUSTOMERS. JUDGMENT IS REQUIRED IN DETERMINING WHEN TECHNOLOGICAL FEASIBILITY OF A PRODUCT IS ESTABLISHED. WE HAVE DETERMINED THAT TECHNOLOGICAL\nFEASIBILITY FOR OUR SOFTWARE PRODUCTS IS REACHED AFTER ALL HIGH-RISK DEVELOPMENT ISSUES HAVE BEEN RESOLVED THROUGH CODING AND TESTING. GENERALLY, THIS OCCURS SHORTLY BEFORE THE PRODUCTS ARE RELEASED TO MANUFACTURING. THE AMORTIZATION OF THESE COSTS\nIS INCLUDED IN COST OF REVENUE OVER THE ESTIMATED LIFE OF THE PRODUCTS.\nLEGAL AND OTHER CONTINGENCIES\nTHE OUTCOMES OF LEGAL PROCEEDINGS AND CLAIMS BROUGHT AGAINST US ARE SUBJECT TO SIGNIFICANT UNCERTAINTY. AN ESTIMATED LOSS FROM A LOSS CONTINGENCY\nSUCH AS A LEGAL PROCEEDING OR CLAIM IS ACCRUED BY A CHARGE TO INCOME IF IT IS PROBABLE THAT AN ASSET HAS BEEN IMPAIRED OR A LIABILITY HAS BEEN INCURRED AND THE AMOUNT OF THE LOSS CAN BE REASONABLY ESTIMATED. DISCLOSURE OF A CONTINGENCY IS REQUIRED\nIF THERE IS AT LEAST A REASONABLE POSSIBILITY THAT A LOSS HAS BEEN INCURRED. IN DETERMINING WHETHER A LOSS SHOULD BE ACCRUED WE EVALUATE, AMONG OTHER FACTORS, THE DEGREE OF PROBABILITY OF AN UNFAVORABLE OUTCOME AND THE ABILITY TO MAKE A REASONABLE\nESTIMATE OF THE AMOUNT OF LOSS. CHANGES IN THESE FACTORS COULD MATERIALLY IMPACT OUR FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.\nINCOME TAXES\nTHE OBJECTIVES OF ACCOUNTING FOR INCOME TAXES ARE TO RECOGNIZE THE AMOUNT OF TAXES PAYABLE OR REFUNDABLE FOR THE CURRENT YEAR AND DEFERRED TAX\nLIABILITIES AND ASSETS FOR THE FUTURE TAX CONSEQUENCES OF EVENTS THAT HAVE BEEN RECOGNIZED IN AN ENTITY\u0092S FINANCIAL STATEMENTS OR TAX RETURNS. WE RECOGNIZE THE TAX BENEFIT FROM AN UNCERTAIN TAX POSITION ONLY IF IT IS MORE LIKELY THAN NOT THAT\nTHE TAX POSITION WILL BE SUSTAINED ON EXAMINATION BY THE TAXING AUTHORITIES, BASED ON THE TECHNICAL MERITS OF THE POSITION. THE TAX BENEFITS RECOGNIZED IN THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FROM SUCH A POSITION ARE MEASURED BASED ON THE LARGEST BENEFIT THAT\nHAS A GREATER THAN 50% LIKELIHOOD OF BEING REALIZED UPON ULTIMATE SETTLEMENT. ACCOUNTING LITERATURE ALSO PROVIDES GUIDANCE ON DERECOGNITION OF INCOME TAX ASSETS AND LIABILITIES, CLASSIFICATION OF CURRENT AND DEFERRED INCOME TAX ASSETS AND\nLIABILITIES, ACCOUNTING FOR INTEREST AND PENALTIES ASSOCIATED WITH TAX POSITIONS, AND INCOME TAX DISCLOSURES. JUDGMENT IS REQUIRED IN ASSESSING THE FUTURE TAX CONSEQUENCES OF EVENTS THAT HAVE BEEN RECOGNIZED IN OUR FINANCIAL STATEMENTS OR TAX\nRETURNS. VARIATIONS IN THE ACTUAL OUTCOME OF THESE FUTURE TAX CONSEQUENCES COULD MATERIALLY IMPACT OUR FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.\nSTOCK-BASED\nCOMPENSATION\nSTOCK-BASED COMPENSATION COST IS MEASURED AT THE GRANT DATE BASED ON THE FAIR VALUE OF THE AWARD AND IS RECOGNIZED AS\nEXPENSE, NET OF ESTIMATED FORFEITURES, OVER THE REQUISITE SERVICE PERIOD. DETERMINING THE FAIR VALUE OF STOCK-BASED AWARDS AT THE GRANT DATE REQUIRES JUDGMENT, INCLUDING ESTIMATING EXPECTED DIVIDENDS. IN ADDITION, JUDGMENT IS ALSO REQUIRED IN\nESTIMATING THE AMOUNT OF STOCK-BASED AWARDS THAT ARE EXPECTED TO BE FORFEITED. IF ACTUAL RESULTS DIFFER SIGNIFICANTLY FROM THESE ESTIMATES, STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION EXPENSE AND OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS COULD BE IMPACTED.\n43\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nPART II\nITEM 7\nSTATEMENT OF MANAGEMENT\u0092S RESPONSIBILITY FOR FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nMANAGEMENT IS RESPONSIBLE FOR THE PREPARATION OF THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND RELATED INFORMATION THAT ARE PRESENTED IN THIS REPORT.\nTHE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS, WHICH INCLUDE AMOUNTS BASED ON MANAGEMENT\u0092S ESTIMATES AND JUDGMENTS, HAVE BEEN PREPARED IN CONFORMITY WITH ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES GENERALLY ACCEPTED IN THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA.\nTHE COMPANY DESIGNS AND MAINTAINS ACCOUNTING AND INTERNAL CONTROL SYSTEMS TO PROVIDE REASONABLE ASSURANCE AT REASONABLE COST THAT ASSETS ARE\nSAFEGUARDED AGAINST LOSS FROM UNAUTHORIZED USE OR DISPOSITION, AND THAT THE FINANCIAL RECORDS ARE RELIABLE FOR PREPARING FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND MAINTAINING ACCOUNTABILITY FOR ASSETS. THESE SYSTEMS ARE AUGMENTED BY WRITTEN POLICIES, AN\nORGANIZATIONAL STRUCTURE PROVIDING DIVISION OF RESPONSIBILITIES, CAREFUL SELECTION AND TRAINING OF QUALIFIED PERSONNEL, AND A PROGRAM OF INTERNAL AUDITS.\nTHE COMPANY ENGAGED DELOITTE & TOUCHE LLP, AN INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM, TO AUDIT AND RENDER AN OPINION ON THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL\nREPORTING IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE STANDARDS OF THE PUBLIC COMPANY ACCOUNTING OVERSIGHT BOARD (UNITED STATES).\nTHE BOARD OF DIRECTORS,\nTHROUGH ITS AUDIT COMMITTEE, CONSISTING SOLELY OF INDEPENDENT DIRECTORS OF THE COMPANY, MEETS PERIODICALLY WITH MANAGEMENT, INTERNAL AUDITORS, AND OUR INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM TO ENSURE THAT EACH IS MEETING ITS RESPONSIBILITIES\nAND TO DISCUSS MATTERS CONCERNING INTERNAL CONTROLS AND FINANCIAL REPORTING.

FACTORS THAT MIGHT CAUSE SUCH DIFFERENCES INCLUDE, BUT\nARE NOT LIMITED TO, THOSE DISCUSSED IN PART I, ITEM 1A OF THIS FORM 10-K UNDER THE HEADING \u0093RISK FACTORS,\u0094 WHICH ARE INCORPORATED HEREIN BY REFERENCE. THE FOLLOWING DISCUSSION SHOULD BE READ IN CONJUNCTION WITH THE CONSOLIDATED\nFINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND NOTES THERETO INCLUDED IN PART II, ITEM 8 OF THIS FORM 10-K. ALL INFORMATION PRESENTED HEREIN IS BASED ON THE COMPANY\u0092S FISCAL CALENDAR. UNLESS OTHERWISE STATED, REFERENCES TO PARTICULAR YEARS OR QUARTERS REFER TO\nTHE COMPANY\u0092S FISCAL YEARS ENDED IN SEPTEMBER AND THE ASSOCIATED QUARTERS OF THOSE FISCAL YEARS. EACH OF THE TERMS THE \u0093COMPANY\u0094 AND \u0093APPLE\u0094 AS USED HEREIN REFERS COLLECTIVELY TO APPLE INC. AND ITS WHOLLY-OWNED SUBSIDIARIES,\nUNLESS OTHERWISE STATED. THE COMPANY ASSUMES NO OBLIGATION TO REVISE OR UPDATE ANY FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS FOR ANY REASON, EXCEPT AS REQUIRED BY LAW.\nEXECUTIVE OVERVIEW\nTHE COMPANY DESIGNS, MANUFACTURES, AND MARKETS MOBILE\nCOMMUNICATION AND MEDIA DEVICES, PERSONAL COMPUTERS, AND PORTABLE DIGITAL MUSIC PLAYERS, AND SELLS A VARIETY OF RELATED SOFTWARE, SERVICES, PERIPHERALS, NETWORKING SOLUTIONS, AND THIRD-PARTY DIGITAL CONTENT AND APPLICATIONS. THE COMPANY\u0092S\nPRODUCTS AND SERVICES INCLUDE IPHONE, IPAD, MAC, IPOD, APPLE TV, A PORTFOLIO OF CONSUMER AND PROFESSIONAL SOFTWARE APPLICATIONS, THE IOS AND OS X OPERATING SYSTEMS, ICLOUD, AND A VARIETY OF ACCESSORY, SERVICE AND SUPPORT OFFERINGS. THE COMPANY ALSO\nSELLS AND DELIVERS DIGITAL CONTENT AND APPLICATIONS THROUGH THE ITUNES STORE, APP STORE, IBOOKSTORE, AND MAC APP STORE. THE COMPANY SELLS ITS PRODUCTS WORLDWIDE THROUGH ITS RETAIL STORES, ONLINE STORES, AND DIRECT SALES FORCE, AS WELL AS THROUGH\nTHIRD-PARTY CELLULAR NETWORK CARRIERS, WHOLESALERS, RETAILERS, AND VALUE-ADDED RESELLERS. IN ADDITION, THE COMPANY SELLS A VARIETY OF THIRD-PARTY IPHONE, IPAD, MAC AND IPOD COMPATIBLE PRODUCTS, INCLUDING APPLICATION SOFTWARE, AND VARIOUS ACCESSORIES\nTHROUGH ITS ONLINE AND RETAIL STORES. THE COMPANY SELLS TO CONSUMERS; SMALL AND MID-SIZED BUSINESSES; AND EDUCATION, ENTERPRISE AND GOVERNMENT CUSTOMERS.\nTHE COMPANY IS COMMITTED TO BRINGING THE BEST USER EXPERIENCE TO ITS CUSTOMERS THROUGH ITS INNOVATIVE HARDWARE, SOFTWARE, PERIPHERALS, AND SERVICES. THE COMPANY\u0092S BUSINESS STRATEGY LEVERAGES ITS\nUNIQUE ABILITY TO DESIGN AND DEVELOP ITS OWN OPERATING SYSTEMS, HARDWARE, APPLICATION SOFTWARE, AND SERVICES TO PROVIDE ITS CUSTOMERS NEW PRODUCTS AND SOLUTIONS WITH SUPERIOR EASE-OF-USE, SEAMLESS INTEGRATION, AND INNOVATIVE DESIGN. AS PART OF ITS\nSTRATEGY, THE COMPANY CONTINUES TO EXPAND ITS PLATFORM FOR THE DISCOVERY AND DELIVERY OF THIRD-PARTY DIGITAL CONTENT AND APPLICATIONS THROUGH THE ITUNES STORE. AS PART OF THE ITUNES STORE, THE COMPANY\u0092S APP STORE AND IBOOKSTORE ALLOW CUSTOMERS\nTO DISCOVER AND DOWNLOAD APPLICATIONS AND BOOKS THROUGH EITHER A MAC OR WINDOWS-BASED COMPUTER OR THROUGH \u0093IOS DEVICES,\u0094 NAMELY IPHONE, IPAD AND IPOD TOUCH. THE COMPANY\u0092S MAC APP STORE ALLOWS CUSTOMERS TO EASILY DISCOVER, DOWNLOAD AND\nINSTALL MAC APPLICATIONS. THE COMPANY ALSO SUPPORTS A COMMUNITY FOR THE DEVELOPMENT OF THIRD-PARTY SOFTWARE AND HARDWARE PRODUCTS AND DIGITAL CONTENT THAT COMPLEMENT THE COMPANY\u0092S OFFERINGS. THE COMPANY\u0092S STRATEGY ALSO INCLUDES EXPANDING\nITS DISTRIBUTION NETWORK TO EFFECTIVELY REACH MORE CUSTOMERS AND PROVIDE THEM WITH A HIGH-QUALITY SALES AND POST-SALES SUPPORT EXPERIENCE.\nTHE COMPANY PARTICIPATES IN SEVERAL HIGHLY COMPETITIVE MARKETS, INCLUDING THE MARKET FOR MOBILE COMMUNICATIONS AND MEDIA DEVICES WITH ITS IOS DEVICES; PERSONAL COMPUTERS WITH ITS MAC COMPUTERS; PORTABLE\nDIGITAL PLAYERS WITH IPOD; AND DISTRIBUTION OF THIRD-PARTY DIGITAL CONTENT AND APPLICATIONS WITH THE ITUNES STORE, APP STORE, IBOOKSTORE, AND MAC APP STORE. WHILE THE COMPANY IS WIDELY RECOGNIZED AS A LEADING INNOVATOR IN\n25\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nTHE MARKETS WHERE IT COMPETES, THESE MARKETS ARE HIGHLY COMPETITIVE AND SUBJECT TO AGGRESSIVE PRICING. TO REMAIN COMPETITIVE, THE COMPANY BELIEVES THAT CONTINUAL INVESTMENT IN RESEARCH AND\nDEVELOPMENT AND MARKETING AND ADVERTISING IS CRITICAL TO THE DEVELOPMENT AND SALE OF INNOVATIVE PRODUCTS AND TECHNOLOGIES. THE COMPANY\u0092S RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT SPENDING IS FOCUSED ON INVESTING IN NEW HARDWARE AND SOFTWARE PRODUCTS, AND IN\nFURTHER DEVELOPING ITS EXISTING PRODUCTS, INCLUDING IPHONE, IPAD, MAC, AND IPOD HARDWARE; IOS AND OS X OPERATING SYSTEMS; AND A VARIETY OF APPLICATION SOFTWARE AND ONLINE SERVICES.\nTHE COMPANY USES A VARIETY OF DIRECT AND INDIRECT DISTRIBUTION CHANNELS, SUCH AS ITS RETAIL STORES, ONLINE STORES, AND DIRECT SALES\nFORCE, AND THIRD-PARTY CELLULAR NETWORK CARRIERS, WHOLESALERS, RETAILERS, AND VALUE-ADDED RESELLERS. THE COMPANY BELIEVES THAT SALES OF ITS INNOVATIVE AND DIFFERENTIATED PRODUCTS ARE ENHANCED BY KNOWLEDGEABLE SALESPERSONS WHO CAN CONVEY THE VALUE OF\nTHE HARDWARE AND SOFTWARE INTEGRATION, AND DEMONSTRATE THE UNIQUE SOLUTIONS THAT ARE AVAILABLE ON ITS PRODUCTS. THE COMPANY FURTHER BELIEVES PROVIDING DIRECT CONTACT WITH ITS TARGETED CUSTOMERS IS AN EFFECTIVE WAY TO DEMONSTRATE THE ADVANTAGES OF\nITS PRODUCTS OVER THOSE OF ITS COMPETITORS AND PROVIDING A HIGH-QUALITY SALES AND AFTER-SALES SUPPORT EXPERIENCE IS CRITICAL TO ATTRACTING NEW AND RETAINING EXISTING CUSTOMERS. TO ENSURE A HIGH-QUALITY BUYING EXPERIENCE FOR ITS PRODUCTS IN WHICH\nSERVICE AND EDUCATION ARE EMPHASIZED, THE COMPANY CONTINUES TO EXPAND AND IMPROVE ITS DISTRIBUTION CAPABILITIES BY EXPANDING THE NUMBER OF ITS OWN RETAIL STORES WORLDWIDE. ADDITIONALLY, THE COMPANY HAS INVESTED IN PROGRAMS TO ENHANCE RESELLER SALES\nBY PLACING HIGH QUALITY APPLE FIXTURES, MERCHANDISING MATERIALS AND OTHER RESOURCES WITHIN SELECTED THIRD-PARTY RESELLER LOCATIONS. THROUGH THE APPLE PREMIUM RESELLER PROGRAM, CERTAIN THIRD-PARTY RESELLERS FOCUS ON THE APPLE PLATFORM BY PROVIDING A\nHIGH LEVEL OF INTEGRATION AND SUPPORT SERVICES, AND PRODUCT EXPERTISE.\nCRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES\nTHE PREPARATION OF FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND RELATED DISCLOSURES IN CONFORMITY WITH U.S. GENERALLY ACCEPTED ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES\n(\u0093GAAP\u0094) AND THE COMPANY\u0092S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF ITS FINANCIAL CONDITION AND OPERATING RESULTS REQUIRE THE COMPANY\u0092S MANAGEMENT TO MAKE JUDGMENTS, ASSUMPTIONS AND ESTIMATES THAT AFFECT THE AMOUNTS REPORTED IN ITS\nCONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND ACCOMPANYING NOTES. NOTE 1, \u0093SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES\u0094 OF THE NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS IN PART II, ITEM 8 OF THIS FORM 10-K DESCRIBES THE SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING\nPOLICIES AND METHODS USED IN THE PREPARATION OF THE COMPANY\u0092S CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS. MANAGEMENT BASES ITS ESTIMATES ON HISTORICAL EXPERIENCE AND ON VARIOUS OTHER ASSUMPTIONS IT BELIEVES TO BE REASONABLE UNDER THE CIRCUMSTANCES, THE\nRESULTS OF WHICH FORM THE BASIS FOR MAKING JUDGMENTS ABOUT THE CARRYING VALUES OF ASSETS AND LIABILITIES. ACTUAL RESULTS MAY DIFFER FROM THESE ESTIMATES AND SUCH DIFFERENCES MAY BE MATERIAL.\nMANAGEMENT BELIEVES THE COMPANY\u0092S CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES ARE THOSE RELATED TO REVENUE RECOGNITION, VALUATION AND\nIMPAIRMENT OF MARKETABLE SECURITIES, INVENTORY VALUATION AND INVENTORY PURCHASE COMMITMENTS, WARRANTY COSTS, INCOME TAXES, AND LEGAL AND OTHER CONTINGENCIES. MANAGEMENT CONSIDERS THESE POLICIES CRITICAL BECAUSE THEY ARE BOTH IMPORTANT TO THE\nPORTRAYAL OF THE COMPANY\u0092S FINANCIAL CONDITION AND OPERATING RESULTS, AND THEY REQUIRE MANAGEMENT TO MAKE JUDGMENTS AND ESTIMATES ABOUT INHERENTLY UNCERTAIN MATTERS. THE COMPANY\u0092S SENIOR MANAGEMENT HAS REVIEWED THESE CRITICAL ACCOUNTING\nPOLICIES AND RELATED DISCLOSURES WITH THE AUDIT AND FINANCE COMMITTEE OF THE COMPANY\u0092S BOARD OF DIRECTORS.\nREVENUE RECOGNITION\nNET SALES CONSIST PRIMARILY OF REVENUE FROM THE SALE OF HARDWARE, SOFTWARE, DIGITAL CONTENT AND APPLICATIONS, PERIPHERALS,\nAND SERVICE AND SUPPORT CONTRACTS. THE COMPANY RECOGNIZES REVENUE WHEN PERSUASIVE EVIDENCE OF AN ARRANGEMENT EXISTS, DELIVERY HAS OCCURRED, THE SALES PRICE IS FIXED OR DETERMINABLE, AND COLLECTION IS PROBABLE. PRODUCT IS CONSIDERED DELIVERED TO THE\nCUSTOMER ONCE IT HAS BEEN SHIPPED AND TITLE AND RISK OF LOSS HAVE BEEN TRANSFERRED. FOR MOST OF THE COMPANY\u0092S PRODUCT SALES, THESE CRITERIA ARE MET AT THE TIME THE PRODUCT IS SHIPPED. FOR ONLINE SALES TO INDIVIDUALS, FOR SOME SALES TO EDUCATION\nCUSTOMERS IN THE U.S., AND FOR CERTAIN OTHER SALES, THE COMPANY DEFERS REVENUE UNTIL THE CUSTOMER RECEIVES THE PRODUCT BECAUSE THE COMPANY RETAINS A PORTION OF THE RISK OF LOSS ON THESE SALES DURING TRANSIT. THE COMPANY RECOGNIZES REVENUE FROM THE\nSALE OF HARDWARE PRODUCTS,\n26\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nSOFTWARE BUNDLED WITH HARDWARE THAT IS ESSENTIAL TO THE FUNCTIONALITY OF THE HARDWARE, AND THIRD-PARTY DIGITAL CONTENT SOLD ON THE ITUNES STORE IN ACCORDANCE WITH GENERAL REVENUE RECOGNITION\nACCOUNTING GUIDANCE. THE COMPANY RECOGNIZES REVENUE IN ACCORDANCE WITH INDUSTRY SPECIFIC SOFTWARE ACCOUNTING GUIDANCE FOR THE FOLLOWING TYPES OF SALES TRANSACTIONS: (I) STANDALONE SALES OF SOFTWARE PRODUCTS, (II) SALES OF SOFTWARE UPGRADES\nAND (III) SALES OF SOFTWARE BUNDLED WITH HARDWARE NOT ESSENTIAL TO THE FUNCTIONALITY OF THE HARDWARE.\nFOR MULTI-ELEMENT\nARRANGEMENTS THAT INCLUDE HARDWARE PRODUCTS CONTAINING SOFTWARE ESSENTIAL TO THE HARDWARE PRODUCT\u0092S FUNCTIONALITY, UNDELIVERED SOFTWARE ELEMENTS THAT RELATE TO THE HARDWARE PRODUCT\u0092S ESSENTIAL SOFTWARE, AND\/OR UNDELIVERED NON-SOFTWARE\nSERVICES, THE COMPANY ALLOCATES REVENUE TO ALL DELIVERABLES BASED ON THEIR RELATIVE SELLING PRICES. IN SUCH CIRCUMSTANCES, THE COMPANY USES A HIERARCHY TO DETERMINE THE SELLING PRICE TO BE USED FOR ALLOCATING REVENUE TO DELIVERABLES.\n(I) VENDOR-SPECIFIC OBJECTIVE EVIDENCE OF FAIR VALUE (\u0093VSOE\u0094), (II) THIRD-PARTY EVIDENCE OF SELLING PRICE (\u0093TPE\u0094) AND (III) BEST ESTIMATE OF SELLING PRICE (\u0093ESP\u0094). VSOE GENERALLY EXISTS ONLY WHEN THE\nCOMPANY SELLS THE DELIVERABLE SEPARATELY AND IS THE PRICE ACTUALLY CHARGED BY THE COMPANY FOR THAT DELIVERABLE. ESPS REFLECT THE COMPANY\u0092S BEST ESTIMATES OF WHAT THE SELLING PRICES OF ELEMENTS WOULD BE IF THEY WERE SOLD REGULARLY ON A\nSTAND-ALONE BASIS.\nFOR SALES OF QUALIFYING VERSIONS OF IOS DEVICES, MAC AND APPLE TV, THE COMPANY HAS INDICATED IT MAY FROM\nTIME TO TIME PROVIDE FUTURE UNSPECIFIED SOFTWARE UPGRADES AND FEATURES FREE OF CHARGE TO CUSTOMERS. THE COMPANY ALSO PROVIDES VARIOUS NON-SOFTWARE SERVICES TO OWNERS OF QUALIFYING VERSIONS OF IOS DEVICES AND MAC. BECAUSE THE COMPANY HAS NEITHER VSOE\nNOR TPE FOR THE UNSPECIFIED SOFTWARE UPGRADE RIGHTS OR THE NON-SOFTWARE SERVICES, REVENUE IS ALLOCATED TO THESE RIGHTS AND SERVICES BASED ON THE COMPANY\u0092S ESPS. REVENUE ALLOCATED TO THE UNSPECIFIED SOFTWARE UPGRADE RIGHTS AND NON-SOFTWARE\nSERVICES BASED ON THE COMPANY\u0092S ESPS IS DEFERRED AND RECOGNIZED ON A STRAIGHT-LINE BASIS OVER THE ESTIMATED PERIOD THE SOFTWARE UPGRADES AND NON-SOFTWARE SERVICES ARE EXPECTED TO BE PROVIDED FOR EACH OF THESE DEVICES, WHICH RANGES FROM TWO TO\nFOUR YEARS.\nTHE COMPANY\u0092S PROCESS FOR DETERMINING ESPS INVOLVES MANAGEMENT\u0092S JUDGMENT AND CONSIDERS MULTIPLE\nFACTORS THAT MAY VARY OVER TIME DEPENDING UPON THE UNIQUE FACTS AND CIRCUMSTANCES RELATED TO EACH DELIVERABLE. IF THE FACTS AND CIRCUMSTANCES UNDERLYING THE FACTORS CONSIDERED CHANGE, INCLUDING THE ESTIMATED OR ACTUAL COSTS INCURRED TO PROVIDE\nNON-SOFTWARE SERVICES OR THE ESTIMATED PERIOD THE SOFTWARE UPGRADES AND NON-SOFTWARE SERVICES ARE EXPECTED TO BE PROVIDED, OR SHOULD FUTURE FACTS AND CIRCUMSTANCES LEAD THE COMPANY TO CONSIDER ADDITIONAL FACTORS, THE COMPANY\u0092S ESPS AND THE\nFUTURE RATE OF RELATED AMORTIZATION FOR SOFTWARE UPGRADES AND NON-SOFTWARE SERVICES RELATED TO FUTURE SALES OF THESE DEVICES COULD CHANGE.\nTHE COMPANY RECORDS REDUCTIONS TO REVENUE FOR ESTIMATED COMMITMENTS RELATED TO PRICE PROTECTION AND OTHER CUSTOMER INCENTIVE PROGRAMS. FOR TRANSACTIONS INVOLVING PRICE PROTECTION, THE COMPANY RECOGNIZES\nREVENUE NET OF THE ESTIMATED AMOUNT TO BE REFUNDED, PROVIDED THE REFUND AMOUNT CAN BE REASONABLY AND RELIABLY ESTIMATED AND THE OTHER CONDITIONS FOR REVENUE RECOGNITION HAVE BEEN MET. THE COMPANY\u0092S POLICY REQUIRES THAT, IF REFUNDS CANNOT BE\nRELIABLY ESTIMATED, REVENUE IS NOT RECOGNIZED UNTIL RELIABLE ESTIMATES CAN BE MADE OR THE PRICE PROTECTION LAPSES. FOR THE COMPANY\u0092S OTHER CUSTOMER INCENTIVE PROGRAMS, THE ESTIMATED COST IS RECOGNIZED AT THE LATER OF THE DATE AT WHICH THE\nCOMPANY HAS SOLD THE PRODUCT OR THE DATE AT WHICH THE PROGRAM IS OFFERED. THE COMPANY ALSO RECORDS REDUCTIONS TO REVENUE FOR EXPECTED FUTURE PRODUCT RETURNS BASED ON THE COMPANY\u0092S HISTORICAL EXPERIENCE. FUTURE MARKET CONDITIONS AND PRODUCT\nTRANSITIONS MAY REQUIRE THE COMPANY TO INCREASE CUSTOMER INCENTIVE PROGRAMS THAT COULD RESULT IN REDUCTIONS TO FUTURE REVENUE. ADDITIONALLY, CERTAIN CUSTOMER INCENTIVE PROGRAMS REQUIRE MANAGEMENT TO ESTIMATE THE NUMBER OF CUSTOMERS WHO WILL ACTUALLY\nREDEEM THE INCENTIVE. MANAGEMENT\u0092S ESTIMATES ARE BASED ON HISTORICAL EXPERIENCE AND THE SPECIFIC TERMS AND CONDITIONS OF PARTICULAR INCENTIVE PROGRAMS. IF A GREATER THAN ESTIMATED PROPORTION OF CUSTOMERS REDEEMS SUCH INCENTIVES, THE COMPANY\nWOULD BE REQUIRED TO RECORD ADDITIONAL REDUCTIONS TO REVENUE, WHICH WOULD HAVE AN ADVERSE IMPACT ON THE COMPANY\u0092S RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.\nVALUATION AND IMPAIRMENT OF MARKETABLE SECURITIES\nTHE COMPANY\u0092S INVESTMENTS IN AVAILABLE-FOR-SALE SECURITIES ARE REPORTED AT FAIR VALUE. UNREALIZED GAINS AND LOSSES RELATED TO CHANGES IN THE FAIR VALUE OF SECURITIES ARE RECOGNIZED IN ACCUMULATED\nOTHER COMPREHENSIVE INCOME, NET\n27\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nOF TAX, IN THE COMPANY\u0092S CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS. CHANGES IN THE FAIR VALUE OF AVAILABLE-FOR-SALE SECURITIES IMPACT THE COMPANY\u0092S NET INCOME ONLY WHEN SUCH SECURITIES ARE SOLD OR AN\nOTHER-THAN-TEMPORARY IMPAIRMENT IS RECOGNIZED. REALIZED GAINS AND LOSSES ON THE SALE OF SECURITIES ARE DETERMINED BY SPECIFIC IDENTIFICATION OF EACH SECURITY\u0092S COST BASIS. THE COMPANY REGULARLY REVIEWS ITS INVESTMENT PORTFOLIO TO DETERMINE IF\nANY SECURITY IS OTHER-THAN-TEMPORARILY IMPAIRED, WHICH WOULD REQUIRE THE COMPANY TO RECORD AN IMPAIRMENT CHARGE IN THE PERIOD ANY SUCH DETERMINATION IS MADE. IN MAKING THIS JUDGMENT, THE COMPANY EVALUATES, AMONG OTHER THINGS, THE DURATION AND EXTENT\nTO WHICH THE FAIR VALUE OF A SECURITY IS LESS THAN ITS COST; THE FINANCIAL CONDITION OF THE ISSUER AND ANY CHANGES THERETO; AND THE COMPANY\u0092S INTENT TO SELL, OR WHETHER IT WILL MORE LIKELY THAN NOT BE REQUIRED TO SELL, THE SECURITY BEFORE\nRECOVERY OF THE ITS AMORTIZED COST BASIS. THE COMPANY\u0092S ASSESSMENT ON WHETHER A SECURITY IS OTHER-THAN-TEMPORARILY IMPAIRED COULD CHANGE IN THE FUTURE DUE TO NEW DEVELOPMENTS OR CHANGES IN ASSUMPTIONS RELATED TO ANY PARTICULAR SECURITY.\nINVENTORY VALUATION AND INVENTORY PURCHASE COMMITMENTS\nTHE COMPANY MUST ORDER COMPONENTS FOR ITS PRODUCTS AND BUILD INVENTORY IN ADVANCE OF PRODUCT SHIPMENTS. THE COMPANY RECORDS A WRITE-DOWN FOR INVENTORIES OF COMPONENTS AND PRODUCTS, INCLUDING THIRD-PARTY\nPRODUCTS HELD FOR RESALE, WHICH HAVE BECOME OBSOLETE OR ARE IN EXCESS OF ANTICIPATED DEMAND OR NET REALIZABLE VALUE. THE COMPANY PERFORMS A DETAILED REVIEW OF INVENTORY EACH FISCAL QUARTER THAT CONSIDERS MULTIPLE FACTORS INCLUDING DEMAND FORECASTS,\nPRODUCT LIFE CYCLE STATUS, PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT PLANS, CURRENT SALES LEVELS, AND COMPONENT COST TRENDS. THE INDUSTRIES IN WHICH THE COMPANY COMPETES ARE SUBJECT TO A RAPID AND UNPREDICTABLE PACE OF PRODUCT AND COMPONENT OBSOLESCENCE AND DEMAND\nCHANGES. IF FUTURE DEMAND OR MARKET CONDITIONS FOR THE COMPANY\u0092S PRODUCTS ARE LESS FAVORABLE THAN FORECASTED OR IF UNFORESEEN TECHNOLOGICAL CHANGES NEGATIVELY IMPACT THE UTILITY OF COMPONENT INVENTORY, THE COMPANY MAY BE REQUIRED TO RECORD\nADDITIONAL WRITE-DOWNS, WHICH WOULD ADVERSELY AFFECT ITS RESULTS OF OPERATIONS IN THE PERIOD WHEN THE WRITE-DOWNS WERE RECORDED.\nTHE COMPANY RECORDS ACCRUALS FOR ESTIMATED CANCELLATION FEES RELATED TO COMPONENT ORDERS THAT HAVE BEEN CANCELLED OR ARE EXPECTED TO BE CANCELLED. CONSISTENT WITH INDUSTRY PRACTICE, THE COMPANY ACQUIRES\nCOMPONENTS THROUGH A COMBINATION OF PURCHASE ORDERS, SUPPLIER CONTRACTS, AND OPEN ORDERS BASED ON PROJECTED DEMAND INFORMATION. THESE COMMITMENTS TYPICALLY COVER THE COMPANY\u0092S REQUIREMENTS FOR PERIODS UP TO 150 DAYS. IF THERE IS AN ABRUPT AND\nSUBSTANTIAL DECLINE IN DEMAND FOR ONE OR MORE OF THE COMPANY\u0092S PRODUCTS OR AN UNANTICIPATED CHANGE IN TECHNOLOGICAL REQUIREMENTS FOR ANY OF THE COMPANY\u0092S PRODUCTS, THE COMPANY MAY BE REQUIRED TO RECORD ADDITIONAL ACCRUALS FOR CANCELLATION\nFEES THAT WOULD ADVERSELY AFFECT ITS RESULTS OF OPERATIONS IN THE PERIOD WHEN THE CANCELLATION FEES ARE IDENTIFIED AND RECORDED.\nWARRANTY\nCOSTS\nTHE COMPANY PROVIDES FOR THE ESTIMATED COST OF HARDWARE AND SOFTWARE WARRANTIES AT THE TIME THE RELATED REVENUE IS\nRECOGNIZED BASED ON HISTORICAL AND PROJECTED WARRANTY CLAIM RATES, HISTORICAL AND PROJECTED COST-PER-CLAIM, AND KNOWLEDGE OF SPECIFIC PRODUCT FAILURES THAT ARE OUTSIDE OF THE COMPANY\u0092S TYPICAL EXPERIENCE. EACH QUARTER, THE COMPANY REEVALUATES\nITS ESTIMATES TO ASSESS THE ADEQUACY OF ITS RECORDED WARRANTY LIABILITIES CONSIDERING THE SIZE OF THE INSTALLED BASE OF PRODUCTS SUBJECT TO WARRANTY PROTECTION AND ADJUSTS THE AMOUNTS AS NECESSARY. IF ACTUAL PRODUCT FAILURE RATES OR REPAIR COSTS\nDIFFER FROM ESTIMATES, REVISIONS TO THE ESTIMATED WARRANTY LIABILITIES WOULD BE REQUIRED AND COULD MATERIALLY AFFECT THE COMPANY\u0092S RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.\nINCOME TAXES\nTHE COMPANY RECORDS A TAX PROVISION FOR THE ANTICIPATED TAX\nCONSEQUENCES OF THE REPORTED RESULTS OF OPERATIONS. THE PROVISION FOR INCOME TAXES IS COMPUTED USING THE ASSET AND LIABILITY METHOD, UNDER WHICH DEFERRED TAX ASSETS AND LIABILITIES ARE RECOGNIZED FOR THE EXPECTED FUTURE TAX CONSEQUENCES OF TEMPORARY\nDIFFERENCES BETWEEN THE FINANCIAL REPORTING AND TAX BASES OF ASSETS AND LIABILITIES, AND FOR OPERATING LOSSES AND TAX CREDIT CARRYFORWARDS. DEFERRED TAX ASSETS AND LIABILITIES ARE MEASURED USING THE CURRENTLY ENACTED TAX RATES THAT APPLY TO TAXABLE\nINCOME IN EFFECT FOR THE YEARS IN WHICH THOSE TAX ASSETS ARE EXPECTED TO BE REALIZED OR SETTLED. THE COMPANY RECORDS A\n28\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nVALUATION ALLOWANCE TO REDUCE DEFERRED TAX ASSETS TO THE AMOUNT THAT IS BELIEVED MORE LIKELY THAN NOT TO BE REALIZED.\nTHE COMPANY RECOGNIZES TAX BENEFITS FROM UNCERTAIN TAX POSITIONS ONLY IF IT IS MORE LIKELY THAN NOT THAT THE TAX POSITION WILL BE SUSTAINED ON EXAMINATION BY THE TAXING AUTHORITIES, BASED ON THE TECHNICAL\nMERITS OF THE POSITION. THE TAX BENEFITS RECOGNIZED IN THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FROM SUCH POSITIONS ARE THEN MEASURED BASED ON THE LARGEST BENEFIT THAT HAS A GREATER THAN 50% LIKELIHOOD OF BEING REALIZED UPON ULTIMATE SETTLEMENT.\nMANAGEMENT BELIEVES IT IS MORE LIKELY THAN NOT THAT FORECASTED INCOME, INCLUDING INCOME THAT MAY BE GENERATED AS A RESULT OF CERTAIN TAX\nPLANNING STRATEGIES, TOGETHER WITH FUTURE REVERSALS OF EXISTING TAXABLE TEMPORARY DIFFERENCES, WILL BE SUFFICIENT TO FULLY RECOVER THE DEFERRED TAX ASSETS. IN THE EVENT THAT THE COMPANY DETERMINES ALL OR PART OF THE NET DEFERRED TAX ASSETS ARE NOT\nREALIZABLE IN THE FUTURE, THE COMPANY WILL MAKE AN ADJUSTMENT TO THE VALUATION ALLOWANCE THAT WOULD BE CHARGED TO EARNINGS IN THE PERIOD SUCH DETERMINATION IS MADE. IN ADDITION, THE CALCULATION OF TAX LIABILITIES INVOLVES SIGNIFICANT JUDGMENT IN\nESTIMATING THE IMPACT OF UNCERTAINTIES IN THE APPLICATION OF GAAP AND COMPLEX TAX LAWS. RESOLUTION OF THESE UNCERTAINTIES IN A MANNER INCONSISTENT WITH MANAGEMENT\u0092S EXPECTATIONS COULD HAVE A MATERIAL IMPACT ON THE COMPANY\u0092S FINANCIAL\nCONDITION AND OPERATING RESULTS.\nLEGAL AND OTHER CONTINGENCIES\nAS DISCUSSED IN PART I, ITEM 3 OF THIS FORM 10-K UNDER THE HEADING \u0093LEGAL PROCEEDINGS\u0094 AND IN PART II, ITEM 8 OF THIS\nFORM 10-K IN THE NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS IN NOTE 7, \u0093COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES,\u0094 THE COMPANY IS SUBJECT TO VARIOUS LEGAL PROCEEDINGS AND CLAIMS, INCLUDING THOSE THAT ARISE IN THE ORDINARY COURSE OF BUSINESS. THE\nCOMPANY RECORDS A LIABILITY WHEN IT IS PROBABLE THAT A LOSS HAS BEEN INCURRED AND THE AMOUNT IS REASONABLY ESTIMABLE. THERE IS SIGNIFICANT JUDGMENT REQUIRED IN BOTH THE PROBABILITY DETERMINATION AND AS TO WHETHER AN EXPOSURE CAN BE REASONABLY\nESTIMATED. IN THE OPINION OF MANAGEMENT, THERE WAS NOT AT LEAST A REASONABLE POSSIBILITY THE COMPANY MAY HAVE INCURRED A MATERIAL LOSS, OR A MATERIAL LOSS IN EXCESS OF A RECORDED ACCRUAL, WITH RESPECT TO LOSS CONTINGENCIES FOR LEGAL AND OTHER\nCONTINGENCIES. HOWEVER, THE OUTCOME OF LEGAL PROCEEDINGS AND CLAIMS BROUGHT AGAINST THE COMPANY IS SUBJECT TO SIGNIFICANT UNCERTAINTY. THEREFORE, ALTHOUGH MANAGEMENT CONSIDERS THE LIKELIHOOD OF SUCH AN OUTCOME TO BE REMOTE, IF ONE OR MORE OF THESE\nLEGAL MATTERS WERE RESOLVED AGAINST THE COMPANY IN A REPORTING PERIOD FOR AMOUNTS IN EXCESS OF MANAGEMENT\u0092S EXPECTATIONS, THE COMPANY\u0092S CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR THAT REPORTING PERIOD COULD BE MATERIALLY ADVERSELY AFFECTED.\nFISCAL PERIOD\nTHE COMPANY\u0092S FISCAL YEAR IS THE 52 OR 53-WEEK PERIOD THAT ENDS ON THE LAST SATURDAY OF SEPTEMBER. THE COMPANY\u0092S FISCAL YEARS 2012, 2011 AND 2010 ENDED ON SEPTEMBER 29,\n2012, SEPTEMBER 24, 2011, AND SEPTEMBER 25, 2010, RESPECTIVELY. FISCAL YEAR 2012 SPANNED 53 WEEKS, WITH A 14\nTH\nWEEK INCLUDED IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2012, AS IS DONE APPROXIMATELY EVERY SIX YEARS TO REALIGN THE COMPANY\u0092S\nFISCAL QUARTERS MORE CLOSELY TO CALENDAR QUARTERS. INCLUSION OF THE ADDITIONAL WEEK IN 2012 INCREASED THE COMPANY\u0092S OVERALL NET SALES AND OPERATING EXPENSES FOR THE YEAR. FISCAL YEARS 2011 AND 2010 SPANNED 52\nWEEKS EACH.

SEVERAL FACTORS CONTRIBUTED POSITIVELY TO THIS\nINCREASE, INCLUDING THE ADDITION OF A 14\nTH\nWEEK IN THE\nFIRST QUARTER OF 2012, AS WELL AS THE FOLLOWING.\n\u0095\nNET SALES OF IPHONE AND RELATED PRODUCTS AND SERVICES WERE $80.5 BILLION IN 2012, REPRESENTING AN INCREASE OF $33.4 BILLION OR 71% COMPARED TO 2011.\nIPHONE UNIT SALES TOTALED 125.0 MILLION DURING 2012, REPRESENTING AN INCREASE OF 52.8 MILLION UNITS OR 73% COMPARED TO 2011. THE YEAR-OVER-YEAR GROWTH IN IPHONE NET SALES AND UNIT SALES DURING 2012 REFLECTS STRONG DEMAND FOR IPHONE IN ALL\nOF THE COMPANY\u0092S OPERATING SEGMENTS, WHICH IS PRIMARILY A RESULT OF THE LAUNCHES OF IPHONE 4S IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2012 AND IPHONE 5 IN THE FOURTH QUARTER OF 2012, ONGOING DEMAND FOR IPHONE 4 AND IPHONE 3GS, AND EXPANDED DISTRIBUTION WITH\nNEW CARRIERS AND RESELLERS. NET SALES OF IPHONE AND RELATED PRODUCTS AND SERVICES WERE 51% AND 43% OF THE COMPANY\u0092S TOTAL NET SALES FOR 2012 AND 2011, RESPECTIVELY.\n\u0095\nNET SALES OF IPAD AND RELATED PRODUCTS AND SERVICES WERE $32.4 BILLION IN 2012, REPRESENTING AN INCREASE OF $12.1 BILLION OR 59% COMPARED TO 2011.\nUNIT SALES OF IPAD WERE 58.3 MILLION DURING 2012, AN INCREASE OF 80% FROM 2011. THE YEAR-OVER-YEAR INCREASE IN IPAD NET SALES AND UNIT SALES DURING 2012 WAS DRIVEN BY STRONG DEMAND FOR IPAD IN ALL OF THE COMPANY\u0092S OPERATING SEGMENTS AS A\nRESULT OF THE LAUNCH OF THE NEW IPAD IN MARCH 2012, CONTINUED DEMAND FOR IPAD 2, AND EXPANDED DISTRIBUTION WITH NEW RESELLERS. THE YEAR-OVER-YEAR GROWTH RATE OF IPAD UNIT SALES WAS HIGHER THAN THE GROWTH RATE OF IPAD NET SALES DURING 2012 DUE TO A\nREDUCTION OF AVERAGE SELLING PRICES AS A RESULT OF A SHIFT IN PRODUCT MIX TOWARD LOWER-PRICED IPAD MODELS, THE PRICE REDUCTION FOR IPAD 2 AND AN INCREASE IN INDIRECT SALES DUE TO EXPANDED DISTRIBUTION THROUGH THIRD-PARTY RESELLERS. NET SALES OF IPAD\nAND RELATED PRODUCTS AND SERVICES WERE 21% AND 19% OF THE COMPANY\u0092S TOTAL NET SALES FOR 2012 AND 2011, RESPECTIVELY.\n\u0095\nMAC NET SALES WERE $23.2 BILLION IN 2012, REPRESENTING AN INCREASE OF $1.4 BILLION OR 7% COMPARED TO 2011. MAC UNIT SALES TOTALED 18.2 MILLION\nDURING 2012, REPRESENTING AN INCREASE OF 1.4 MILLION OR 9% COMPARED TO 2011. THE YEAR-OVER-YEAR GROWTH IN MAC NET SALES AND UNIT SALES DURING 2012 REFLECTS INCREASED DEMAND FOR MAC PORTABLES IN ALL OF THE COMPANY\u0092S OPERATING SEGMENTS\nDRIVEN BY 2012 RELEASES OF UPDATED MODELS OF MACBOOK AIR AND MACBOOK PRO, INCLUDING THE NEW MACBOOK PRO WITH RETINA DISPLAY IN JUNE 2012. PARTIALLY OFFSETTING THE INCREASE IN NET SALES OF MAC PORTABLES WAS A DECLINE IN NET SALES OF MAC DESKTOPS THAT\nREFLECTED THE OVERALL DECLINE IN THE MARKET FOR DESKTOP PERSONAL COMPUTERS DURING 2012. ADDITIONALLY, THE COMPANY DID NOT INTRODUCE UPDATED VERSIONS OF ITS MAC DESKTOP PRODUCTS IN 2012. MAC NET SALES WERE 15% AND 20% OF THE COMPANY\u0092S TOTAL NET\nSALES FOR 2012 AND 2011, RESPECTIVELY.\n\u0095\nNET SALES OF OTHER MUSIC RELATED PRODUCTS AND SERVICES WERE $8.5 BILLION IN 2012, REPRESENTING AN INCREASE OF $2.2 BILLION OR 35% COMPARED TO 2011.\nTHE INCREASE WAS DUE PRIMARILY TO GROWTH OF THE ITUNES STORE, WHICH GENERATED TOTAL NET SALES OF $7.5 BILLION FOR 2012 COMPARED TO NET SALES OF $5.4 BILLION DURING 2011. THE STRONG RESULTS OF THE ITUNES STORE REFLECT GROWTH OF THE APP STORE;\nGROWTH OF THE COMPANY\u0092S CUSTOMER BASE; AND THE CONTINUED EXPANSION OF THIRD-PARTY AUDIO, VIDEO AND BOOK CONTENT AVAILABLE FOR SALE OR RENT VIA THE ITUNES STORE. THE COMPANY CONTINUES TO EXPAND ITS ITUNES CONTENT AND APPLICATIONS OFFERINGS\nAROUND THE WORLD. NET SALES OF OTHER MUSIC RELATED PRODUCTS AND SERVICES WERE 5% AND 6% OF THE COMPANY\u0092S TOTAL NET SALES FOR 2012 AND 2011, RESPECTIVELY.\nPARTIALLY OFFSETTING THE POSITIVE FACTORS CONTRIBUTING TO THE OVERALL INCREASE IN NET SALES WAS A DECREASE IN IPOD NET SALES EXPERIENCED\nACROSS ALL OPERATING SEGMENTS. IPOD NET SALES WERE $5.6 BILLION IN 2012, A DECREASE OF $1.8 BILLION OR 25% COMPARED TO 2011. SIMILARLY, IPOD UNIT SALES DECREASED BY 17% IN 2012 COMPARED TO 2011. DECLINES IN NET SALES AND UNIT SALES OF IPOD\nREFLECT THE CONTINUING CONTRACTION OF THE OVERALL MARKET FOR MP3 PLAYERS. NET SALES OF IPOD WERE 4% AND 7% OF THE COMPANY\u0092S TOTAL NET SALES FOR 2012 AND 2011, RESPECTIVELY.\nTHE COMPANY HAS HISTORICALLY EXPERIENCED HIGHER NET SALES IN ITS FIRST FISCAL QUARTER COMPARED TO OTHER QUARTERS IN ITS FISCAL YEAR DUE\nIN PART TO HOLIDAY SEASONAL DEMAND. ACTUAL AND ANTICIPATED TIMING OF NEW PRODUCT INTRODUCTIONS\n31\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nBY THE COMPANY CAN ALSO SIGNIFICANTLY IMPACT THE LEVEL OF NET SALES EXPERIENCED BY THE COMPANY IN ANY PARTICULAR QUARTER. HOWEVER, NEITHER HISTORICAL SEASONAL PATTERNS NOR HISTORICAL PATTERNS OF\nPRODUCT INTRODUCTIONS SHOULD BE CONSIDERED RELIABLE INDICATORS OF THE COMPANY\u0092S FUTURE NET SALES OR FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE.\nGROWTH IN TOTAL NET SALES WAS PARTICULARLY STRONG DURING THE FIRST SIX MONTHS OF 2012, RISING $34.1 BILLION OR 66% COMPARED TO THE SAME PERIOD IN 2011. THE NET SALES GROWTH DURING THE FIRST SIX MONTHS OF\n2012 REFLECTS THE LAUNCH OF IPHONE 4S IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2012 AND THE COMPANY\u0092S ABILITY TO MEET DEMAND MORE QUICKLY FOR IPHONE 4S WHEN COMPARED TO THE IPHONE 4 LAUNCH. GROWTH DURING THE FIRST HALF OF 2012 WAS ALSO FAVORABLY IMPACTED BY THE\nADDITION OF A 14\nTH\nWEEK IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2012 AND\nSTRONG UNIT SALES OF IPAD DURING THE HOLIDAY SEASON, RESULTING IN A 111% INCREASE IN IPAD UNIT SALES DURING THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2012 COMPARED TO THE SAME QUARTER IN 2011.\nFISCAL YEAR 2011 VERSUS 2010\nNET SALES DURING 2011 INCREASED $43.0\nBILLION OR 66% COMPARED TO 2010. SEVERAL FACTORS CONTRIBUTED POSITIVELY TO THIS INCREASE, INCLUDING THE FOLLOWING.\n\u0095\nNET SALES OF IPHONE AND RELATED PRODUCTS AND SERVICES WERE $47.1 BILLION IN 2011, REPRESENTING AN INCREASE OF $21.9 BILLION OR 87% COMPARED TO 2010.\nIPHONE UNIT SALES TOTALED 72.3 MILLION DURING 2011, REPRESENTING AN INCREASE OF 32.3 MILLION UNITS OR 81% COMPARED TO 2010. IPHONE YEAR-OVER-YEAR NET SALES GROWTH REFLECTED STRONG DEMAND FOR IPHONE 4 IN ALL OF THE COMPANY\u0092S OPERATING\nSEGMENTS. THE EXPANDED U.S. DISTRIBUTION OF IPHONE TO THE VERIZON WIRELESS NETWORK BEGINNING IN FEBRUARY 2011, CONTINUED EXPANSION INTO NEW COUNTRIES, AND INCREASED DISTRIBUTION WITH OTHER NEW CARRIERS AND RESELLERS ALSO CONTRIBUTED TO THE\nYEAR-OVER-YEAR GROWTH OF IPHONE. NET SALES OF IPHONE AND RELATED PRODUCTS AND SERVICES ACCOUNTED FOR 43% AND 39% OF THE COMPANY\u0092S TOTAL NET SALES FOR 2011 AND 2010, RESPECTIVELY.\n\u0095\nNET SALES OF IPAD AND RELATED PRODUCTS AND SERVICES, WHICH THE COMPANY INTRODUCED IN THE THIRD QUARTER OF 2010, WERE $20.4 BILLION IN 2011,\nREPRESENTING AN INCREASE OF $15.4 BILLION OR 311% COMPARED TO 2010. UNIT SALES OF IPAD WERE 32.4 MILLION DURING 2011, AN INCREASE OF 334% FROM 2010. THE YEAR-OVER-YEAR UNIT GROWTH AND NET SALES GROWTH WERE DRIVEN BY STRONG IPAD DEMAND IN ALL OF\nTHE COMPANY\u0092S OPERATING SEGMENTS. NET SALES OF IPAD AND RELATED PRODUCTS AND SERVICES ACCOUNTED FOR 19% AND 8% OF THE COMPANY\u0092S TOTAL NET SALES FOR 2011 AND 2010, RESPECTIVELY.\n\u0095\nMAC NET SALES WERE $21.8 BILLION IN 2011, REPRESENTING AN INCREASE OF $4.3 BILLION OR 25% COMPARED TO 2010. MAC UNIT SALES INCREASED BY\n3.1 MILLION OR 22% IN 2011 COMPARED TO 2010. THE YEAR-OVER-YEAR GROWTH IN MAC NET SALES AND UNIT SALES WAS DUE PRIMARILY TO HIGHER DEMAND IN ALL OF THE COMPANY\u0092S OPERATING SEGMENTS FOR MACBOOK AIR AND MACBOOK PRO, WHICH WERE UPDATED IN\nJULY 2011 AND FEBRUARY 2011, RESPECTIVELY. THE YEAR-OVER-YEAR REVENUE GROWTH FOR PORTABLES AND DESKTOPS WAS 36% AND 4%, RESPECTIVELY. MAC NET SALES ACCOUNTED FOR 20% AND 27% OF THE COMPANY\u0092S TOTAL NET SALES FOR 2011 AND 2010, RESPECTIVELY.\n\u0095\nNET SALES OF OTHER MUSIC RELATED PRODUCTS AND SERVICES WERE $6.3 BILLION IN 2011, REPRESENTING AN INCREASE OF $1.4 BILLION OR 28% COMPARED TO 2010.\nTHE INCREASE WAS DUE PRIMARILY TO INCREASED NET SALES FROM THE ITUNES STORE, WHICH WAS LARGELY DRIVEN BY APP STORE EXPANSION INTO NEW COUNTRIES THAT CONTRIBUTED TO STRONG GROWTH IN ALL OF THE COMPANY\u0092S GEOGRAPHIC SEGMENTS. DURING 2011, NET\nSALES FOR THE ITUNES STORE, APP STORE AND IBOOKSTORE WAS $5.4 BILLION, REPRESENTING AN INCREASE OF 33% COMPARED TO 2010. THE COMPANY BELIEVES THIS CONTINUED GROWTH WAS THE RESULT OF HEIGHTENED CONSUMER INTEREST IN DOWNLOADING THIRD-PARTY DIGITAL\nCONTENT, CONTINUED GROWTH IN ITS CUSTOMER BASE OF IOS DEVICES, EXPANSION OF THIRD-PARTY AUDIO AND VIDEO CONTENT AVAILABLE VIA THE ITUNES STORE, AND CONTINUED INTEREST IN AND GROWTH OF THE APP STORE. NET SALES OF OTHER MUSIC RELATED PRODUCTS AND\nSERVICES ACCOUNTED FOR 6% AND 8% OF THE COMPANY\u0092S TOTAL NET SALES FOR 2011 AND 2010, RESPECTIVELY.\nPARTIALLY OFFSETTING THE POSITIVE FACTORS CONTRIBUTING TO THE OVERALL INCREASE IN NET SALES WAS A DECREASE IN IPOD NET SALES OF $821\nMILLION OR 10% DURING 2011 COMPARED TO 2010. SIMILARLY, IPOD UNIT SALES DECREASED BY 15% IN 2011 COMPARED TO 2010. HOWEVER, NET SALES PER IPOD UNIT SOLD INCREASED DURING 2011 COMPARED TO 2010 DUE PRIMARILY\n32\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nTO A SHIFT IN IPOD PRODUCT MIX TOWARD IPOD TOUCH. NET SALES OF IPOD ACCOUNTED FOR 7% AND 13% OF THE COMPANY\u0092S TOTAL NET SALES FOR 2011 AND 2010, RESPECTIVELY.\nSEGMENT OPERATING PERFORMANCE\nTHE COMPANY MANAGES ITS BUSINESS PRIMARILY ON A GEOGRAPHIC BASIS.

THE GROWTH IN NET SALES DURING 2012 WAS\nPRIMARILY DRIVEN BY INCREASED DEMAND FOR IPHONE FOLLOWING THE LAUNCHES OF IPHONE 4S AND IPHONE 5, STRONG DEMAND FOR THE NEW IPAD AND IPAD 2, AND HIGHER SALES FROM THE ITUNES STORE. THE AMERICAS SEGMENT REPRESENTED APPROXIMATELY 37% AND 35% OF THE\nCOMPANY\u0092S TOTAL NET SALES FOR 2012 AND 2011, RESPECTIVELY.\nNET SALES IN THE AMERICAS SEGMENT INCREASED $13.8 BILLION OR\n56% DURING 2011 COMPARED TO 2010. THE PRIMARY CONTRIBUTORS TO THE GROWTH IN NET SALES WAS A SIGNIFICANT YEAR-OVER-YEAR INCREASE IN IPHONE SALES FROM CARRIER EXPANSION AND STRONG DEMAND FOR IPHONE 4 AND INCREASED SALES OF IPAD AND MAC, PARTIALLY\nOFFSET BY A DECREASE IN IPOD SALES. HIGHER SALES OF THIRD-PARTY DIGITAL CONTENT AND APPLICATIONS FROM THE ITUNES STORE ALSO DROVE AN INCREASE IN NET SALES DURING 2011. THE AMERICAS SEGMENT REPRESENTED APPROXIMATELY 35% AND 37% OF THE COMPANY\u0092S\nTOTAL NET SALES FOR 2011 AND 2010, RESPECTIVELY.\nEUROPE\nNET SALES IN THE EUROPE SEGMENT INCREASED $8.5 BILLION OR 31% DURING 2012 COMPARED TO 2011.

IPHONE 5 WAS LAUNCHED IN A LIMITED NUMBER OF COUNTRIES IN THE EUROPE SEGMENT AT THE END OF THE FOURTH QUARTER OF 2012 AND DID NOT CONTRIBUTE TO THE GROWTH IN\nNET SALES IN THE EUROPE SEGMENT TO THE EXTENT IT DID IN OTHER SEGMENTS. LOWER YEAR-OVER-YEAR GROWTH IN NET SALES IN THE EUROPE SEGMENT DURING 2012 COMPARED TO THE COMPANY\u0092S OTHER GEOGRAPHIC SEGMENTS REFLECTS GROWTH IN IPHONE UNIT SALES THAT WAS\nWELL BELOW THE GROWTH RATES EXPERIENCED BY THE COMPANY\u0092S OTHER OPERATING SEGMENTS, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY STRONG GROWTH IN IPAD UNIT SALES. NET SALES IN THE EUROPE SEGMENT WERE ALSO NEGATIVELY IMPACTED BY THE REGION\u0092S UNCERTAIN ECONOMIC\nCONDITIONS AND THE STRENGTH IN THE U.S. DOLLAR RELATIVE TO SEVERAL EUROPEAN CURRENCIES, INCLUDING THE EURO.

THE EUROPE SEGMENT REPRESENTED\n26% AND 29% OF THE COMPANY\u0092S TOTAL NET SALES FOR 2011 AND 2010, RESPECTIVELY.\n33\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nJAPAN\nNET SALES IN THE JAPAN SEGMENT INCREASED $5.1 BILLION OR 94% DURING 2012 COMPARED TO 2011.

THE GROWTH IN NET SALES\nDURING 2012 WAS MAINLY DUE TO INCREASED DEMAND FOR IPHONE FROM THE LAUNCH OF IPHONE 4S, STRONG DEMAND FOR THE NEW IPAD AND IPAD 2, AND HIGHER MAC SALES. GROWTH IN THE ASIA PACIFIC SEGMENT WAS AFFECTED BY THE TIMING OF IPHONE AND IPAD PRODUCT\nLAUNCHES. IPHONE 5 WAS LAUNCHED IN A LIMITED NUMBER OF COUNTRIES IN THE ASIA PACIFIC SEGMENT DURING THE FOURTH QUARTER OF 2012 AND WAS NOT LAUNCHED IN CHINA DURING 2012, AND THE NEW IPAD THAT WAS INTRODUCED BY THE COMPANY IN MARCH 2012 WAS NOT\nLAUNCHED IN CHINA UNTIL THE FOURTH QUARTER OF 2012.

KOREA AND AUSTRALIA ALSO EXPERIENCED STRONG YEAR-OVER-YEAR REVENUE GROWTH.

THE GROWTH IN NET SALES DURING 2012 WAS DRIVEN PRIMARILY BY INCREASED DEMAND FOR IPHONE FOLLOWING THE LAUNCHES OF IPHONE 4S AND IPHONE 5, STRONG DEMAND FOR THE\nNEW IPAD AND IPAD 2, AND HIGHER MAC NET SALES. LOWER YEAR-OVER-YEAR GROWTH IN NET SALES IN THE RETAIL SEGMENT DURING 2012 COMPARED TO THE COMPANY\u0092S OTHER SEGMENTS REFLECTS THE SIGNIFICANT GROWTH IN IPAD INDIRECT DISTRIBUTION CHANNEL\nEXPANSION. THE RETAIL SEGMENT ACCOUNTED FOR 12% AND 13% OF THE COMPANY\u0092S TOTAL NET SALES FOR 2012 AND 2011, RESPECTIVELY.\nTHE COMPANY OPENED 33 NEW RETAIL STORES DURING 2012, 28 OF WHICH WERE OUTSIDE THE U.S., ENDING THE YEAR WITH 390 STORES OPEN COMPARED TO 357 STORES AT THE END OF 2011.

THE RETAIL SEGMENT REPRESENTED 13% AND 15% OF THE COMPANY\u0092S TOTAL NET SALES IN 2011 AND 2010, RESPECTIVELY.\nTHE RETAIL SEGMENT\u0092S OPERATING INCOME WAS $4.7 BILLION, $3.2 BILLION, AND $2.3 BILLION DURING 2012, 2011, AND 2010 RESPECTIVELY.\nTHESE YEAR-OVER-YEAR INCREASES IN RETAIL OPERATING INCOME WERE PRIMARILY ATTRIBUTABLE TO HIGHER OVERALL NET SALES THAT RESULTED IN SIGNIFICANTLY HIGHER AVERAGE REVENUE PER STORE DURING THE RESPECTIVE YEARS.\nGROSS MARGIN\nGROSS\nMARGIN FOR 2012, 2011 AND 2010 ARE AS FOLLOWS (IN MILLIONS, EXCEPT GROSS MARGIN PERCENTAGES).\n2012\n2011\n2010\nNET SALES\n$156,508\n$108,249\n$65,225\nCOST OF SALES\n87,846\n64,431\n39,541\nGROSS MARGIN\n$68,662\n$43,818\n$25,684\nGROSS MARGIN PERCENTAGE\n43.9%\n40.5%\n39.4%\nTHE GROSS MARGIN PERCENTAGE IN 2012 WAS 43.9%, COMPARED TO 40.5% IN 2011. THIS YEAR-OVER-YEAR INCREASE IN\nGROSS MARGIN WAS LARGELY DRIVEN BY LOWER COMMODITY AND OTHER PRODUCT COSTS, A HIGHER MIX OF IPHONE SALES, AND IMPROVED LEVERAGE ON FIXED COSTS FROM HIGHER NET SALES. THE INCREASE IN GROSS MARGIN WAS PARTIALLY OFFSET BY THE IMPACT OF A STRONGER U.S.\nDOLLAR. THE GROSS MARGIN PERCENTAGE DURING THE FIRST HALF OF 2012 WAS 45.9% COMPARED TO 41.4% DURING THE SECOND HALF OF 2012. THE PRIMARY DRIVERS OF HIGHER GROSS MARGIN IN THE FIRST HALF OF 2012 COMPARED TO THE SECOND HALF ARE A HIGHER MIX OF IPHONE\nSALES AND IMPROVED LEVERAGE ON FIXED COSTS FROM HIGHER NET SALES. ADDITIONALLY, GROSS MARGIN IN THE SECOND HALF OF 2012 WAS ALSO AFFECTED BY THE INTRODUCTION OF NEW PRODUCTS WITH FLAT PRICING THAT HAVE HIGHER COST STRUCTURES AND DELIVER\nGREATER VALUE TO CUSTOMERS, PRICE REDUCTIONS ON CERTAIN EXISTING PRODUCTS, HIGHER TRANSITION COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH PRODUCT LAUNCHES, AND CONTINUED STRENGTHENING OF THE U.S. DOLLAR; PARTIALLY OFFSET BY LOWER COMMODITY COSTS.\nTHE GROSS MARGIN PERCENTAGE IN 2011 WAS 40.5%, COMPARED TO 39.4% IN 2010. THIS YEAR-OVER-YEAR INCREASE IN GROSS MARGIN WAS LARGELY DRIVEN\nBY LOWER COMMODITY AND OTHER PRODUCT COSTS.\nTHE COMPANY EXPECTS TO EXPERIENCE DECREASES IN ITS GROSS MARGIN PERCENTAGE IN\nFUTURE PERIODS, AS COMPARED TO LEVELS ACHIEVED DURING 2012, AND THE COMPANY ANTICIPATES GROSS MARGIN OF ABOUT 36% DURING THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2013. EXPECTED FUTURE DECLINES IN GROSS MARGIN ARE LARGELY DUE TO A HIGHER MIX OF NEW AND INNOVATIVE\nPRODUCTS WITH FLAT OR REDUCED PRICING THAT HAVE HIGHER COST STRUCTURES AND DELIVER GREATER VALUE TO CUSTOMERS AND ANTICIPATED COMPONENT COST AND OTHER COST INCREASES. FUTURE STRENGTHENING OF THE U.S. DOLLAR COULD FURTHER NEGATIVELY IMPACT GROSS\nMARGIN.\nTHE FOREGOING STATEMENTS REGARDING THE COMPANY\u0092S EXPECTED GROSS MARGIN PERCENTAGE IN FUTURE PERIODS, INCLUDING\nTHE FIRST QUARTER OF 2013, ARE FORWARD-LOOKING AND COULD DIFFER FROM ACTUAL RESULTS BECAUSE OF SEVERAL FACTORS INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO THOSE SET FORTH ABOVE IN PART I, ITEM 1A OF THIS FORM 10-K UNDER THE HEADING \u0093RISK FACTORS\u0094\nAND THOSE DESCRIBED IN THIS PARAGRAPH. IN GENERAL, GROSS MARGINS AND MARGINS ON INDIVIDUAL PRODUCTS WILL REMAIN UNDER DOWNWARD PRESSURE DUE TO A VARIETY OF FACTORS, INCLUDING CONTINUED INDUSTRY WIDE GLOBAL PRODUCT PRICING PRESSURES, INCREASED\nCOMPETITION, COMPRESSED PRODUCT LIFE CYCLES, PRODUCT TRANSITIONS AND POTENTIAL INCREASES IN THE COST OF COMPONENTS, AS WELL AS POTENTIAL INCREASES IN THE COSTS OF OUTSIDE MANUFACTURING SERVICES AND A POTENTIAL SHIFT IN THE COMPANY\u0092S SALES MIX\nTOWARDS PRODUCTS WITH LOWER GROSS MARGINS. IN RESPONSE TO COMPETITIVE PRESSURES, THE COMPANY EXPECTS IT WILL CONTINUE TO TAKE PRODUCT PRICING ACTIONS, WHICH WOULD ADVERSELY AFFECT GROSS MARGINS. GROSS MARGINS COULD ALSO BE AFFECTED BY THE\nCOMPANY\u0092S ABILITY TO MANAGE PRODUCT QUALITY AND WARRANTY COSTS EFFECTIVELY AND TO STIMULATE DEMAND FOR CERTAIN OF ITS PRODUCTS. DUE TO THE COMPANY\u0092S SIGNIFICANT INTERNATIONAL OPERATIONS, FINANCIAL RESULTS CAN BE SIGNIFICANTLY AFFECTED IN\nTHE SHORT-TERM BY FLUCTUATIONS IN EXCHANGE RATES.\n35\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nOPERATING EXPENSES\nOPERATING EXPENSES FOR 2012, 2011, AND 2010 ARE AS FOLLOWS (IN MILLIONS, EXCEPT FOR PERCENTAGES).\n2012\n2011\n2010\nRESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT\n$3,381\n$2,429\n$1,782\nPERCENTAGE OF NET SALES\n2%\n2%\n3%\nSELLING, GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE\n$10,040\n$7,599\n$5,517\nPERCENTAGE OF NET SALES\n6%\n7%\n8%\nRESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT (\u0093R&D\u0094) EXPENSE\nR&D EXPENSE INCREASED $952 MILLION OR 39% IN 2012 COMPARED TO 2011 AND $647 MILLION OR 36% IN 2011 COMPARED TO 2010. THE GROWTH IN\nR&D EXPENSE WAS DRIVEN BY AN INCREASE IN HEADCOUNT AND RELATED EXPENSES TO SUPPORT EXPANDED R&D ACTIVITIES. ALTHOUGH TOTAL R&D EXPENSE INCREASED 39% AND 36% IN 2012 AND 2011, RESPECTIVELY, IT REMAINED FAIRLY CONSISTENT AS A PERCENTAGE OF\nNET SALES.\nTHE COMPANY CONTINUES TO BELIEVE THAT FOCUSED INVESTMENTS IN R&D ARE CRITICAL TO ITS FUTURE GROWTH AND\nCOMPETITIVE POSITION IN THE MARKETPLACE AND ARE DIRECTLY RELATED TO TIMELY DEVELOPMENT OF NEW AND ENHANCED PRODUCTS THAT ARE CENTRAL TO THE COMPANY\u0092S CORE BUSINESS STRATEGY. AS SUCH, THE COMPANY EXPECTS TO MAKE FURTHER INVESTMENTS IN R&D TO\nREMAIN COMPETITIVE.\nSELLING, GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE (\u0093SG&A\u0094) EXPENSE\nSG&A EXPENSE INCREASED $2.4 BILLION OR 32% DURING 2012 COMPARED TO 2011 AND $2.1 BILLION OR 38% DURING 2011 COMPARED TO 2010. THESE\nINCREASES WERE PRIMARILY DUE TO THE COMPANY\u0092S CONTINUED EXPANSION OF ITS RETAIL SEGMENT, INCREASED HEADCOUNT AND RELATED EXPENSES, HIGHER SPENDING ON PROFESSIONAL SERVICES, MARKETING AND ADVERTISING PROGRAMS, AND INCREASED VARIABLE COSTS\nASSOCIATED WITH THE OVERALL GROWTH OF THE COMPANY\u0092S NET SALES.\nOTHER INCOME AND EXPENSE\nOTHER INCOME AND EXPENSE FOR 2012, 2011, AND 2010 ARE AS FOLLOWS (IN MILLIONS).\n2012\n2011\n2010\nINTEREST AND DIVIDEND INCOME\n$1,088\n$519\n$311\nOTHER EXPENSE, NET\n(566\n)\n(104\n)\n(156\n)\nTOTAL OTHER INCOME\/(EXPENSE), NET\n$522\n$415\n$155\nTOTAL OTHER INCOME AND EXPENSE INCREASED $107 MILLION OR 26% TO $522 MILLION DURING 2012 COMPARED TO\n$415 MILLION AND $155 MILLION IN 2011 AND 2010, RESPECTIVELY. THE YEAR-OVER-YEAR INCREASE IN OTHER INCOME AND EXPENSE DURING 2012 WAS DUE PRIMARILY TO HIGHER INTEREST AND DIVIDEND INCOME ON THE COMPANY\u0092S HIGHER CASH, CASH EQUIVALENTS AND\nMARKETABLE SECURITIES BALANCES, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY HIGHER PREMIUM EXPENSES ON FOREIGN EXCHANGE CONTRACTS. THE OVERALL INCREASE IN OTHER INCOME AND EXPENSE IN 2011 COMPARED TO 2010 WAS ATTRIBUTABLE TO HIGHER INTEREST INCOME AND NET REALIZED GAINS ON\nSALES OF MARKETABLE SECURITIES. THE WEIGHTED AVERAGE INTEREST RATE EARNED BY THE COMPANY ON ITS CASH, CASH EQUIVALENTS AND MARKETABLE SECURITIES WAS 1.03%, 0.77%, AND 0.75% DURING 2012, 2011, AND 2010, RESPECTIVELY. DURING 2012, 2011, AND 2010, THE\nCOMPANY HAD NO DEBT OUTSTANDING AND ACCORDINGLY DID NOT INCUR ANY RELATED INTEREST EXPENSE.\nPROVISION FOR INCOME TAXES\nTHE COMPANY\u0092S EFFECTIVE TAX RATES WERE APPROXIMATELY 25.2%, 24.2%, AND 24.4% FOR 2012, 2011, AND 2010, RESPECTIVELY. THE\nCOMPANY\u0092S EFFECTIVE RATES FOR THESE PERIODS DIFFER FROM THE STATUTORY FEDERAL INCOME TAX RATE OF\n36\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\n35% DUE PRIMARILY TO CERTAIN UNDISTRIBUTED FOREIGN EARNINGS FOR WHICH NO U.S. TAXES ARE PROVIDED BECAUSE SUCH EARNINGS ARE INTENDED TO BE INDEFINITELY REINVESTED OUTSIDE THE U.S.\nAS OF SEPTEMBER 29, 2012, THE COMPANY HAD DEFERRED TAX ASSETS ARISING FROM DEDUCTIBLE TEMPORARY DIFFERENCES, TAX LOSSES, AND TAX\nCREDITS OF $4.0 BILLION, AND DEFERRED TAX LIABILITIES OF $14.9 BILLION. MANAGEMENT BELIEVES IT IS MORE LIKELY THAN NOT THAT FORECASTED INCOME, INCLUDING INCOME THAT MAY BE GENERATED AS A RESULT OF CERTAIN TAX PLANNING STRATEGIES, TOGETHER WITH\nFUTURE REVERSALS OF EXISTING TAXABLE TEMPORARY DIFFERENCES, WILL BE SUFFICIENT TO FULLY RECOVER THE DEFERRED TAX ASSETS. THE COMPANY WILL CONTINUE TO EVALUATE THE REALIZABILITY OF DEFERRED TAX ASSETS QUARTERLY BY ASSESSING THE NEED FOR AND AMOUNT OF\nA VALUATION ALLOWANCE.\nTHE INTERNAL REVENUE SERVICE (THE \u0093IRS\u0094) HAS COMPLETED ITS FIELD AUDIT OF THE COMPANY\u0092S\nFEDERAL INCOME TAX RETURNS FOR THE YEARS 2004 THROUGH 2006 AND PROPOSED CERTAIN ADJUSTMENTS. THE COMPANY HAS CONTESTED CERTAIN OF THESE ADJUSTMENTS THROUGH THE IRS APPEALS OFFICE. THE IRS IS CURRENTLY EXAMINING THE YEARS 2007 THROUGH 2009. ALL IRS\nAUDIT ISSUES FOR YEARS PRIOR TO 2004 HAVE BEEN RESOLVED. IN ADDITION, THE COMPANY IS SUBJECT TO AUDITS BY STATE, LOCAL, AND FOREIGN TAX AUTHORITIES. MANAGEMENT BELIEVES THAT ADEQUATE PROVISIONS HAVE BEEN MADE FOR ANY ADJUSTMENTS THAT MAY RESULT\nFROM TAX EXAMINATIONS. HOWEVER, THE OUTCOME OF TAX AUDITS CANNOT BE PREDICTED WITH CERTAINTY. IF ANY ISSUES ADDRESSED IN THE COMPANY\u0092S TAX AUDITS ARE RESOLVED IN A MANNER NOT CONSISTENT WITH MANAGEMENT\u0092S EXPECTATIONS, THE COMPANY COULD BE\nREQUIRED TO ADJUST ITS PROVISION FOR INCOME TAXES IN THE PERIOD SUCH RESOLUTION OCCURS.\nLIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES\nTHE FOLLOWING TABLE PRESENTS SELECTED FINANCIAL INFORMATION AND STATISTICS AS OF AND FOR THE YEARS ENDED SEPTEMBER 29,\n2012, SEPTEMBER 24, 2011, AND SEPTEMBER 25, 2010 (IN MILLIONS).\n2012\n2011\n2010\nCASH, CASH EQUIVALENTS AND MARKETABLE SECURITIES\n$121,251\n$81,570\n$51,011\nACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE, NET\n$10,930\n$5,369\n$5,510\nINVENTORIES\n$791\n$776\n$1,051\nWORKING CAPITAL\n$19,111\n$17,018\n$20,956\nANNUAL OPERATING CASH FLOW\n$50,856\n$37,529\n$18,595\nAS OF SEPTEMBER 29, 2012, THE COMPANY HAD $121.3 BILLION IN CASH, CASH EQUIVALENTS AND MARKETABLE\nSECURITIES, AN INCREASE OF $39.7 BILLION OR 49% FROM SEPTEMBER 24, 2011. THE PRINCIPAL COMPONENTS OF THIS NET INCREASE WAS THE CASH GENERATED BY OPERATING ACTIVITIES OF $50.9 BILLION, WHICH WAS PARTIALLY OFFSET BY PAYMENTS FOR ACQUISITION OF\nPROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT OF $8.3 BILLION, PAYMENTS FOR ACQUISITION OF INTANGIBLE ASSETS OF $1.1 BILLION AND PAYMENTS OF DIVIDENDS AND DIVIDEND EQUIVALENT RIGHTS OF $2.5 BILLION.\nTHE COMPANY\u0092S MARKETABLE SECURITIES INVESTMENT PORTFOLIO IS INVESTED PRIMARILY IN HIGHLY-RATED SECURITIES AND ITS INVESTMENT POLICY\nGENERALLY LIMITS THE AMOUNT OF CREDIT EXPOSURE TO ANY ONE ISSUER. THE POLICY REQUIRES INVESTMENTS GENERALLY TO BE INVESTMENT GRADE WITH THE OBJECTIVE OF MINIMIZING THE POTENTIAL RISK OF PRINCIPAL LOSS. AS OF SEPTEMBER 29, 2012 AND\nSEPTEMBER 24, 2011, $82.6 BILLION AND $54.3 BILLION, RESPECTIVELY, OF THE COMPANY\u0092S CASH, CASH EQUIVALENTS AND MARKETABLE SECURITIES WERE HELD BY FOREIGN SUBSIDIARIES AND ARE GENERALLY BASED IN U.S. DOLLAR-DENOMINATED HOLDINGS. AMOUNTS\nHELD BY FOREIGN SUBSIDIARIES ARE GENERALLY SUBJECT TO U.S. INCOME TAXATION ON REPATRIATION TO THE U.S. THE COMPANY BELIEVES ITS EXISTING BALANCES OF CASH, CASH EQUIVALENTS AND MARKETABLE SECURITIES WILL BE SUFFICIENT TO SATISFY ITS WORKING CAPITAL\nNEEDS, CAPITAL ASSET PURCHASES, OUTSTANDING COMMITMENTS, COMMON STOCK REPURCHASES, DIVIDENDS ON ITS COMMON STOCK, AND OTHER LIQUIDITY REQUIREMENTS ASSOCIATED WITH ITS EXISTING OPERATIONS OVER THE NEXT 12 MONTHS.\nCAPITAL ASSETS\nTHE\nCOMPANY\u0092S CAPITAL EXPENDITURES WERE $10.3 BILLION DURING 2012, CONSISTING OF $865 MILLION FOR RETAIL STORE FACILITIES AND $9.5 BILLION FOR OTHER CAPITAL EXPENDITURES, INCLUDING PRODUCT TOOLING AND MANUFACTURING PROCESS\n37\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nEQUIPMENT, AND OTHER CORPORATE FACILITIES AND INFRASTRUCTURE. THE COMPANY\u0092S ACTUAL CASH PAYMENTS FOR CAPITAL EXPENDITURES DURING 2012 WERE $8.3 BILLION.\nTHE COMPANY ANTICIPATES UTILIZING APPROXIMATELY $10 BILLION FOR CAPITAL EXPENDITURES DURING 2013, INCLUDING APPROXIMATELY $850 MILLION\nFOR RETAIL STORE FACILITIES AND APPROXIMATELY $9.15 BILLION FOR OTHER CAPITAL EXPENDITURES, INCLUDING PRODUCT TOOLING AND MANUFACTURING PROCESS EQUIPMENT, AND CORPORATE FACILITIES AND INFRASTRUCTURE, INCLUDING INFORMATION SYSTEMS HARDWARE, SOFTWARE\nAND ENHANCEMENTS.\nDURING 2013, THE COMPANY EXPECTS TO OPEN ABOUT 30 TO 35 NEW RETAIL STORES, WITH APPROXIMATELY\nTHREE-QUARTERS LOCATED OUTSIDE OF THE U.S.\nDIVIDEND AND STOCK REPURCHASE PROGRAM\nIN MARCH 2012, THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS OF THE COMPANY APPROVED A DIVIDEND POLICY PURSUANT TO WHICH IT PLANS TO PAY, SUBJECT TO SUBSEQUENT\nDECLARATION, QUARTERLY DIVIDENDS OF $2.65 PER SHARE. THE COMPANY EXPECTS TO PAY APPROXIMATELY $2.5 BILLION EACH QUARTER IN CONJUNCTION WITH THE QUARTERLY DECLARED DIVIDENDS.\nIN MARCH 2012, THE COMPANY\u0092S BOARD OF DIRECTORS AUTHORIZED A PROGRAM TO REPURCHASE UP TO $10 BILLION OF THE COMPANY\u0092S COMMON STOCK BEGINNING IN 2013. THE REPURCHASE PROGRAM IS EXPECTED TO BE\nEXECUTED OVER A THREE-YEAR PERIOD WITH THE PRIMARY OBJECTIVE OF NEUTRALIZING THE IMPACT OF DILUTION FROM FUTURE EMPLOYEE EQUITY GRANTS AND EMPLOYEE STOCK PURCHASE PROGRAMS. THE REPURCHASE PROGRAM DOES NOT OBLIGATE THE COMPANY TO ACQUIRE ANY SPECIFIC\nNUMBER OF SHARES. THE COMPANY ANTICIPATES THAT IT WILL UTILIZE APPROXIMATELY $45 BILLION OF DOMESTIC CASH TO PAY DIVIDENDS, REPURCHASE SHARES, AND TO REMIT WITHHELD TAXES RELATED TO NET SHARE SETTLEMENT OF RESTRICTED STOCK UNITS IN THE FIRST THREE\nYEARS OF THE DIVIDEND AND STOCK REPURCHASE PROGRAMS. THE COMPANY ANTICIPATES THE CASH USED FOR FUTURE DIVIDENDS AND THE REPURCHASE PROGRAM WILL COME PRIMARILY FROM CURRENT DOMESTIC CASH AND FROM ON-GOING U.S. OPERATING ACTIVITIES AND THE CASH\nGENERATED FROM SUCH ACTIVITIES.\nOFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS AND CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS\nTHE COMPANY HAS NOT ENTERED INTO ANY TRANSACTIONS WITH UNCONSOLIDATED ENTITIES WHEREBY THE COMPANY HAS FINANCIAL GUARANTEES, SUBORDINATED\nRETAINED INTERESTS, DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS, OR OTHER CONTINGENT ARRANGEMENTS THAT EXPOSE THE COMPANY TO MATERIAL CONTINUING RISKS, CONTINGENT LIABILITIES, OR ANY OTHER OBLIGATION UNDER A VARIABLE INTEREST IN AN UNCONSOLIDATED ENTITY THAT PROVIDES\nFINANCING, LIQUIDITY, MARKET RISK, OR CREDIT RISK SUPPORT TO THE COMPANY.\nTHE FOLLOWING TABLE PRESENTS CERTAIN PAYMENTS DUE\nBY THE COMPANY UNDER CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS WITH MINIMUM FIRM COMMITMENTS AS OF SEPTEMBER 29, 2012 AND EXCLUDES AMOUNTS ALREADY RECORDED ON THE CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEET (IN MILLIONS).\nTOTAL\nPAYMENTS\nDUE\nIN\nLESS\nTHAN\n1 YEAR\nPAYMENTS\nDUE IN\n1-3 YEARS\nPAYMENTS\nDUE IN\n4-5\nYEARS\nPAYMENTS\nDUE\nIN\nMORE\nTHAN\n5 YEARS\nOPERATING LEASES\n$4,414\n$516\n$1,098\n$999\n$1,801\nPURCHASE OBLIGATIONS\n21,053\n21,053\n0\n0\n0\nOTHER OBLIGATIONS\n988\n937\n49\n2\n0\nTOTAL\n$26,455\n$22,506\n$1,147\n$1,001\n$1,801\nLEASE COMMITMENTS\nTHE COMPANY\u0092S MAJOR FACILITY LEASES ARE TYPICALLY FOR TERMS NOT EXCEEDING 10 YEARS AND GENERALLY PROVIDE RENEWAL OPTIONS FOR TERMS NOT EXCEEDING FIVE ADDITIONAL YEARS. LEASES FOR RETAIL SPACE ARE FOR\nTERMS RANGING FROM\n38\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nFIVE TO 20 YEARS, THE MAJORITY OF WHICH ARE FOR 10 YEARS, AND OFTEN CONTAIN MULTI-YEAR RENEWAL OPTIONS. AS OF SEPTEMBER 29, 2012, THE COMPANY\u0092S TOTAL FUTURE MINIMUM LEASE PAYMENTS UNDER\nNONCANCELABLE OPERATING LEASES WERE $4.4 BILLION, OF WHICH $3.1 BILLION RELATED TO LEASES FOR RETAIL SPACE.\nPURCHASE COMMITMENTS WITH\nOUTSOURCING PARTNERS AND COMPONENT SUPPLIERS\nTHE COMPANY UTILIZES SEVERAL OUTSOURCING PARTNERS TO MANUFACTURE\nSUB-ASSEMBLIES FOR THE COMPANY\u0092S PRODUCTS AND TO PERFORM FINAL ASSEMBLY AND TESTING OF FINISHED PRODUCTS. THESE OUTSOURCING PARTNERS ACQUIRE COMPONENTS AND BUILD PRODUCT BASED ON DEMAND INFORMATION SUPPLIED BY THE COMPANY, WHICH TYPICALLY\nCOVERS PERIODS UP TO 150 DAYS. THE COMPANY ALSO OBTAINS INDIVIDUAL COMPONENTS FOR ITS PRODUCTS FROM A WIDE VARIETY OF INDIVIDUAL SUPPLIERS. CONSISTENT WITH INDUSTRY PRACTICE, THE COMPANY ACQUIRES COMPONENTS THROUGH A COMBINATION OF PURCHASE ORDERS,\nSUPPLIER CONTRACTS, AND OPEN ORDERS BASED ON PROJECTED DEMAND INFORMATION. AS OF SEPTEMBER 29, 2012, THE COMPANY HAD OUTSTANDING OFF-BALANCE SHEET THIRD-PARTY MANUFACTURING COMMITMENTS AND COMPONENT PURCHASE COMMITMENTS OF $21.1 BILLION.\nOTHER OBLIGATIONS\nIN ADDITION TO THE OFF-BALANCE SHEET COMMITMENTS MENTIONED ABOVE, THE COMPANY HAD OUTSTANDING OBLIGATIONS OF $988 MILLION AS OF SEPTEMBER 29, 2012, THAT WERE COMPRISED MAINLY OF COMMITMENTS TO\nACQUIRE CAPITAL ASSETS, INCLUDING PRODUCT TOOLING AND MANUFACTURING PROCESS EQUIPMENT, AND COMMITMENTS RELATED TO ADVERTISING, RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT, INTERNET AND TELECOMMUNICATIONS SERVICES AND OTHER OBLIGATIONS.\nTHE COMPANY\u0092S OTHER NON-CURRENT LIABILITIES IN THE CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS CONSIST PRIMARILY OF DEFERRED TAX LIABILITIES, GROSS\nUNRECOGNIZED TAX BENEFITS AND THE RELATED GROSS INTEREST AND PENALTIES. AS OF SEPTEMBER 29, 2012, THE COMPANY HAD NON-CURRENT DEFERRED TAX LIABILITIES OF $13.8 BILLION. ADDITIONALLY, AS OF SEPTEMBER 29, 2012, THE COMPANY HAD GROSS\nUNRECOGNIZED TAX BENEFITS OF $2.1 BILLION AND AN ADDITIONAL $401 MILLION FOR GROSS INTEREST AND PENALTIES CLASSIFIED AS NON-CURRENT LIABILITIES. AT THIS TIME, THE COMPANY IS UNABLE TO MAKE A REASONABLY RELIABLE ESTIMATE OF THE TIMING OF PAYMENTS IN\nINDIVIDUAL YEARS IN CONNECTION WITH THESE TAX LIABILITIES; THEREFORE, SUCH AMOUNTS ARE NOT INCLUDED IN THE ABOVE CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATION TABLE.\nINDEMNIFICATION\nTHE\nCOMPANY GENERALLY DOES NOT INDEMNIFY END-USERS OF ITS OPERATING SYSTEM AND APPLICATION SOFTWARE AGAINST LEGAL CLAIMS THAT THE SOFTWARE INFRINGES THIRD-PARTY INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS. OTHER AGREEMENTS ENTERED INTO BY THE COMPANY SOMETIMES INCLUDE\nINDEMNIFICATION PROVISIONS UNDER WHICH THE COMPANY COULD BE SUBJECT TO COSTS AND\/OR DAMAGES IN THE EVENT OF AN INFRINGEMENT CLAIM AGAINST THE COMPANY OR AN INDEMNIFIED THIRD-PARTY. HOWEVER, THE COMPANY HAS NOT BEEN REQUIRED TO MAKE ANY SIGNIFICANT\nPAYMENTS RESULTING FROM SUCH AN INFRINGEMENT CLAIM ASSERTED AGAINST IT OR AN INDEMNIFIED THIRD-PARTY. IN THE OPINION OF MANAGEMENT, THERE WAS NOT AT LEAST A REASONABLE POSSIBILITY THE COMPANY MAY HAVE INCURRED A MATERIAL LOSS WITH RESPECT TO\nINDEMNIFICATION OF END-USERS OF ITS OPERATING SYSTEM OR APPLICATION SOFTWARE FOR INFRINGEMENT OF THIRD-PARTY INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS. THE COMPANY DID NOT RECORD A LIABILITY FOR INFRINGEMENT COSTS RELATED TO INDEMNIFICATION AS OF\nSEPTEMBER 29, 2012 OR SEPTEMBER 24, 2011.\nTHE COMPANY HAS ENTERED INTO INDEMNIFICATION AGREEMENTS WITH ITS\nDIRECTORS AND EXECUTIVE OFFICERS. UNDER THESE AGREEMENTS, THE COMPANY HAS AGREED TO INDEMNIFY SUCH INDIVIDUALS TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW AGAINST LIABILITIES THAT ARISE BY REASON OF THEIR STATUS AS DIRECTORS OR OFFICERS AND TO ADVANCE\nEXPENSES INCURRED BY SUCH INDIVIDUALS IN CONNECTION WITH RELATED LEGAL PROCEEDINGS. IT IS NOT POSSIBLE TO DETERMINE THE MAXIMUM POTENTIAL AMOUNT OF PAYMENTS THE COMPANY COULD BE REQUIRED TO MAKE UNDER THESE AGREEMENTS DUE TO THE LIMITED HISTORY OF\nPRIOR INDEMNIFICATION CLAIMS AND THE UNIQUE FACTS AND CIRCUMSTANCES INVOLVED IN EACH CLAIM. HOWEVER, THE COMPANY MAINTAINS DIRECTORS AND OFFICERS LIABILITY INSURANCE COVERAGE TO REDUCE ITS EXPOSURE TO SUCH OBLIGATIONS, AND PAYMENTS MADE UNDER THESE\nAGREEMENTS HISTORICALLY HAVE NOT BEEN MATERIAL.\n39\nTABLE OF CONTENTS","19291":"ITEM 7.\nMANAGEMENT\u0092S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nTHE FOLLOWING DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF OUR FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS SHOULD BE READ TOGETHER WITH OUR CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND RELATED NOTES INCLUDED UNDER ITEM 8 OF THIS\nANNUAL REPORT ON FORM 10-K.\nOVERVIEW\nGOOGLE IS A GLOBAL TECHNOLOGY LEADER FOCUSED ON IMPROVING THE WAYS PEOPLE CONNECT WITH INFORMATION. WE ASPIRE TO BUILD PRODUCTS AND PROVIDE SERVICES\nTHAT IMPROVE THE LIVES OF BILLIONS OF PEOPLE GLOBALLY. OUR MISSION IS TO ORGANIZE THE WORLD\u0092S INFORMATION AND MAKE IT UNIVERSALLY ACCESSIBLE AND USEFUL. OUR INNOVATIONS IN WEB SEARCH AND ADVERTISING HAVE MADE OUR WEBSITE A TOP INTERNET PROPERTY\nAND OUR BRAND ONE OF THE MOST RECOGNIZED IN THE WORLD.\nOUR MOTOROLA BUSINESS IS COMPRISED OF TWO OPERATING SEGMENTS. THE MOBILE SEGMENT\nIS FOCUSED ON MOBILE WIRELESS DEVICES AND RELATED PRODUCTS AND SERVICES. THE HOME SEGMENT IS FOCUSED ON TECHNOLOGIES AND DEVICES THAT PROVIDE VIDEO ENTERTAINMENT SERVICES TO CONSUMERS BY ENABLING SUBSCRIBERS TO ACCESS A VARIETY OF INTERACTIVE\nDIGITAL TELEVISION SERVICES.\nWE GENERATE REVENUE PRIMARILY BY DELIVERING RELEVANT, COST-EFFECTIVE ONLINE ADVERTISING. BUSINESSES USE\nOUR ADWORDS PROGRAM TO PROMOTE THEIR PRODUCTS AND SERVICES WITH TARGETED ADVERTISING. IN ADDITION, THE THIRD PARTIES THAT COMPRISE THE GOOGLE NETWORK USE OUR ADSENSE PROGRAM TO DELIVER RELEVANT ADS THAT GENERATE REVENUES AND ENHANCE THE USER\nEXPERIENCE. WE ALSO GENERATE REVENUES FROM MOTOROLA BY SELLING HARDWARE PRODUCTS.\nIN DECEMBER 2012, WE ENTERED INTO AN AGREEMENT WITH\nARRIS AND CERTAIN OTHER PERSONS PROVIDING FOR THE DISPOSITION OF OUR MOTOROLA HOME SEGMENT. THE TRANSACTION IS EXPECTED TO CLOSE IN 2013.\nTRENDS IN OUR\nBUSINESSES\nADVERTISING TRANSACTIONS CONTINUE TO SHIFT FROM OFFLINE TO ONLINE AS THE DIGITAL ECONOMY EVOLVES. THIS HAS CONTRIBUTED TO THE\nRAPID GROWTH OF OUR BUSINESS SINCE INCEPTION, RESULTING IN SUBSTANTIALLY INCREASED REVENUES, AND WE EXPECT THAT OUR BUSINESS WILL CONTINUE TO GROW. HOWEVER, OUR REVENUE GROWTH RATE HAS GENERALLY DECLINED OVER TIME, AND IT COULD DO SO IN THE FUTURE\nAS A RESULT OF A NUMBER OF FACTORS, INCLUDING INCREASING COMPETITION, OUR INVESTMENTS IN NEW BUSINESS STRATEGIES, PRODUCTS, SERVICES, AND TECHNOLOGIES, CHANGES IN OUR PRODUCT MIX, QUERY GROWTH RATES AND HOW USERS MAKE QUERIES, CHALLENGES IN\nMAINTAINING OUR GROWTH RATE AS OUR REVENUES INCREASE TO HIGHER LEVELS, AND THE EVOLUTION OF THE ONLINE ADVERTISING MARKET, INCLUDING THE INCREASING VARIETY OF ONLINE PLATFORMS FOR ADVERTISING, AND OTHER MARKETS IN WHICH WE PARTICIPATE.\nMOBILE SEARCH QUERIES AND MOBILE COMMERCE ARE GROWING DRAMATICALLY AROUND THE WORLD, AND CONSUMERS ARE USING MULTIPLE DEVICES TO ACCESS\nINFORMATION. OVER TIME THESE TRENDS HAVE RESULTED IN CHANGES IN OUR PRODUCT MIX, INCLUDING A SIGNIFICANT INCREASE IN MOBILE SEARCH QUERIES AND A DECELERATION IN THE GROWTH OF DESKTOP QUERIES. WE EXPECT THAT OUR REVENUE GROWTH RATE WILL CONTINUE TO\nBE AFFECTED BY EVOLVING CONSUMER PREFERENCES, AS WELL AS BY ADVERTISING TRENDS, THE ACCEPTANCE BY MOBILE USERS OF OUR PRODUCTS AND SERVICES, AND OUR ABILITY TO CREATE A SEAMLESS EXPERIENCE FOR BOTH USERS AND ADVERTISERS IN A MULTI-SCREEN\nENVIRONMENT. IN ADDITION, IF THERE IS A FURTHER GENERAL ECONOMIC DOWNTURN, THIS MAY RESULT IN FEWER COMMERCIAL QUERIES BY OUR USERS AND MAY CAUSE ADVERTISERS TO REDUCE THE AMOUNT THEY SPEND ON ONLINE ADVERTISING, INCLUDING THE AMOUNT THEY ARE\nWILLING TO PAY FOR EACH CLICK OR IMPRESSION, WHICH COULD NEGATIVELY AFFECT THE GROWTH RATE OF OUR REVENUES. WE PLAN TO CONTINUE TO INVEST AGGRESSIVELY IN OUR CORE AREAS OF STRATEGIC FOCUS.\nTHE MAIN FOCUS OF OUR ADVERTISING PROGRAMS IS TO PROVIDE RELEVANT AND USEFUL ADVERTISING TO OUR USERS, REFLECTING OUR COMMITMENT TO CONSTANTLY\nIMPROVE THEIR OVERALL WEB EXPERIENCE. AS A RESULT, WE EXPECT TO CONTINUE TO TAKE STEPS TO IMPROVE THE RELEVANCE OF THE ADS DISPLAYED ON OUR WEBSITES AND OUR GOOGLE NETWORK MEMBERS\u0092 WEBSITES. THESE STEPS INCLUDE NOT DISPLAYING ADS THAT GENERATE\nLOW CLICK-THROUGH RATES OR THAT SEND USERS TO IRRELEVANT OR OTHERWISE LOW QUALITY WEBSITES, UPDATING OUR ADVERTISING POLICIES AND ENSURING THEIR COMPLIANCE, AND TERMINATING OUR RELATIONSHIPS WITH THOSE GOOGLE NETWORK MEMBERS WHOSE WEBSITES DO NOT\nMEET OUR QUALITY REQUIREMENTS. WE MAY ALSO CONTINUE TO TAKE STEPS TO REDUCE THE NUMBER OF ACCIDENTAL CLICKS BY OUR USERS. THESE STEPS COULD NEGATIVELY AFFECT THE GROWTH RATE OF OUR REVENUES.\n30\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nBOTH SEASONAL FLUCTUATIONS IN INTERNET USAGE AND TRADITIONAL RETAIL SEASONALITY HAVE AFFECTED, AND\nARE LIKELY TO CONTINUE TO AFFECT, OUR BUSINESS. INTERNET USAGE GENERALLY SLOWS DURING THE SUMMER MONTHS, AND COMMERCIAL QUERIES TYPICALLY INCREASE SIGNIFICANTLY IN THE FOURTH QUARTER OF EACH YEAR. THESE SEASONAL TRENDS HAVE CAUSED, AND WILL LIKELY\nCONTINUE TO CAUSE, FLUCTUATIONS IN OUR QUARTERLY RESULTS, INCLUDING FLUCTUATIONS IN SEQUENTIAL REVENUES, AS WELL AS AGGREGATE PAID CLICK AND AVERAGE COST-PER-CLICK GROWTH RATES.\nTHE OPERATING MARGIN WE REALIZE ON REVENUES GENERATED FROM ADS PLACED ON OUR GOOGLE NETWORK MEMBERS\u0092 WEBSITES THROUGH OUR ADSENSE PROGRAM IS\nSIGNIFICANTLY LOWER THAN THE OPERATING MARGIN WE REALIZE FROM REVENUES GENERATED FROM ADS PLACED ON OUR WEBSITES BECAUSE MOST OF THE ADVERTISER FEES FROM ADS SERVED ON GOOGLE NETWORK MEMBERS\u0092 WEBSITES ARE SHARED WITH OUR GOOGLE NETWORK MEMBERS.\nFOR THE PAST FIVE YEARS, GROWTH IN ADVERTISING REVENUES FROM OUR WEBSITES HAS GENERALLY EXCEEDED THAT FROM OUR GOOGLE NETWORK MEMBERS\u0092 WEBSITES. THIS TREND HAS HAD A POSITIVE IMPACT ON OUR OPERATING MARGINS, AND WE EXPECT THAT THIS WILL\nCONTINUE FOR THE FORESEEABLE FUTURE, ALTHOUGH THE RELATIVE RATE OF GROWTH IN REVENUES FROM OUR WEBSITES COMPARED TO THE RATE OF GROWTH IN REVENUES FROM OUR GOOGLE NETWORK MEMBERS\u0092 WEBSITES MAY VARY OVER TIME. ALSO, THE MARGINS ON ADVERTISING\nREVENUES FROM MOBILE DEVICES AND OTHER NEWER ADVERTISING FORMATS ARE GENERALLY LOWER THAN THOSE FROM DESKTOP COMPUTERS AND TABLETS. WE EXPECT THIS TREND TO CONTINUE TO PRESSURE OUR MARGINS, PARTICULARLY IF WE FAIL TO REALIZE THE OPPORTUNITIES WE\nANTICIPATE WITH THE TRANSITION TO A DYNAMIC MULTI-SCREEN ENVIRONMENT.\nWE CONDUCT OUR MOTOROLA BUSINESS IN HIGHLY COMPETITIVE MARKETS,\nFACING BOTH NEW AND ESTABLISHED COMPETITORS. THE MARKETS FOR MANY OF OUR PRODUCTS ARE CHARACTERIZED BY RAPIDLY CHANGING TECHNOLOGIES, FREQUENT NEW PRODUCT INTRODUCTIONS, CHANGING CONSUMER TRENDS, SHORT PRODUCT LIFE CYCLES, CONSUMER LOYALTY AND\nEVOLVING INDUSTRY STANDARDS. MARKET DISRUPTIONS CAUSED BY NEW TECHNOLOGIES, THE ENTRY OF NEW COMPETITORS, CONSOLIDATIONS AMONG OUR CUSTOMERS AND COMPETITORS, CHANGES IN REGULATORY REQUIREMENTS, CHANGES IN ECONOMIC CONDITIONS, SUPPLY CHAIN\nINTERRUPTIONS OR OTHER FACTORS, CAN INTRODUCE VOLATILITY INTO OUR BUSINESSES. MEETING ALL OF THESE CHALLENGES REQUIRES CONSISTENT OPERATIONAL PLANNING AND EXECUTION AND INVESTMENT IN TECHNOLOGY, RESULTING IN INNOVATIVE PRODUCTS THAT MEET THE NEEDS\nOF OUR CUSTOMERS AROUND THE WORLD.\nFROM AN OVERALL BUSINESS PERSPECTIVE, WE CONTINUE TO INVEST AGGRESSIVELY IN OUR SYSTEMS, DATA\nCENTERS, CORPORATE FACILITIES, INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY INFRASTRUCTURE, AND EMPLOYEES. WE INCREASED OUR HIRING IN 2012, AND WE MAY CONTINUE TO DO SO AND TO PROVIDE COMPETITIVE COMPENSATION PROGRAMS FOR OUR EMPLOYEES. OUR FULL-TIME EMPLOYEE HEADCOUNT\nWAS 32,467 AT DECEMBER 31, 2011 AND 53,861 AT DECEMBER 31, 2012, WHICH INCLUDES 16,317 HEADCOUNT FROM MOTOROLA. ACQUISITIONS WILL ALSO REMAIN AN IMPORTANT COMPONENT OF OUR STRATEGY AND USE OF CAPITAL, AND WE EXPECT OUR CURRENT PACE OF\nACQUISITIONS TO CONTINUE. WE EXPECT OUR COST OF REVENUES WILL INCREASE IN DOLLARS AND MAY INCREASE AS A PERCENTAGE OF REVENUES IN FUTURE PERIODS, PRIMARILY AS A RESULT OF FORECASTED INCREASES IN TRAFFIC ACQUISITION COSTS, MANUFACTURING AND\nINVENTORY-RELATED COSTS, DATA CENTER COSTS, CONTENT ACQUISITION COSTS, CREDIT CARD AND OTHER TRANSACTION FEES, AND OTHER COSTS. IN PARTICULAR, TRAFFIC ACQUISITION COSTS AS A PERCENTAGE OF ADVERTISING REVENUES MAY INCREASE IN THE FUTURE IF WE ARE\nUNABLE TO CONTINUE TO IMPROVE THE MONETIZATION OR GENERATION OF REVENUES FROM TRAFFIC ON OUR WEBSITES AND OUR GOOGLE NETWORK MEMBERS\u0092 WEBSITES.\nAS WE EXPAND OUR ADVERTISING PROGRAMS AND OTHER PRODUCTS TO INTERNATIONAL MARKETS, WE CONTINUE TO INCREASE OUR EXPOSURE TO FLUCTUATIONS IN FOREIGN CURRENCY TO U.S. DOLLAR EXCHANGE RATES. WE HAVE A FOREIGN EXCHANGE\nRISK MANAGEMENT PROGRAM THAT IS DESIGNED TO REDUCE OUR EXPOSURE TO FLUCTUATIONS IN FOREIGN CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATES. HOWEVER, THIS PROGRAM WILL NOT FULLY OFFSET THE EFFECT OF FLUCTUATIONS ON OUR REVENUES AND EARNINGS.\nRESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nWE COMPLETED OUR ACQUISITION\nOF MOTOROLA ON MAY 22, 2012 (THE ACQUISITION DATE). THE OPERATING RESULTS OF MOTOROLA WERE INCLUDED IN OUR CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF INCOME FROM THE ACQUISITION DATE THROUGH DECEMBER 31, 2012.

THIS INCREASE RESULTED PRIMARILY FROM AN INCREASE IN\nADVERTISING REVENUES GENERATED BY GOOGLE WEBSITES AND GOOGLE NETWORK MEMBERS\u0092 WEBSITES AND, TO A LESSER EXTENT, AN INCREASE IN OTHER REVENUES DRIVEN BY HARDWARE PRODUCT SALES. THE INCREASE IN ADVERTISING REVENUES FOR GOOGLE WEBSITES AND GOOGLE\nNETWORK MEMBERS\u0092 WEBSITES RESULTED PRIMARILY FROM AN INCREASE IN THE NUMBER OF PAID CLICKS THROUGH OUR ADVERTISING PROGRAMS, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY A DECREASE IN THE AVERAGE COST-PER-CLICK PAID BY OUR ADVERTISERS. THE INCREASE IN THE NUMBER OF\nPAID CLICKS GENERATED THROUGH OUR ADVERTISING PROGRAMS WAS DUE TO AN INCREASE IN AGGREGATE TRAFFIC INCLUDING MOBILE QUERIES, CERTAIN MONETIZATION IMPROVEMENTS INCLUDING NEW AD FORMATS, THE CONTINUED GLOBAL EXPANSION OF OUR PRODUCTS, ADVERTISERS, AND\nUSER BASE, AS WELL AS AN INCREASE IN THE NUMBER OF GOOGLE NETWORK MEMBERS. THE DECREASE IN THE AVERAGE COST-PER-CLICK PAID BY OUR ADVERTISERS WAS DRIVEN BY VARIOUS FACTORS, SUCH AS THE GENERAL STRENGTHENING OF THE U.S DOLLAR COMPARED TO CERTAIN\nFOREIGN CURRENCIES (PRIMARILY THE EURO), THE REVENUE SHIFT MIX BETWEEN GOOGLE WEBSITES AND GOOGLE NETWORK MEMBERS\u0092 WEBSITES, THE CHANGES IN PLATFORM MIX DUE TO TRAFFIC GROWTH IN MOBILE DEVICES, WHERE THE AVERAGE COST-PER-CLICK IS TYPICALLY\nLOWER COMPARED TO DESKTOP COMPUTERS AND TABLETS, AND THE CHANGES IN GEOGRAPHICAL MIX DUE TO TRAFFIC GROWTH IN EMERGING MARKETS, WHERE THE AVERAGE COST-PER-CLICK IS TYPICALLY LOWER COMPARED TO MORE MATURE MARKETS.\nIN ADDITION, THE INCREASE IN OUR REVENUES FROM 2011 TO 2012 RESULTED FROM THE INCLUSION OF REVENUES FROM OUR MOTOROLA MOBILE BUSINESS OF $4,136\nMILLION.\nOUR REVENUES INCREASED $8,584 MILLION FROM 2010 TO 2011. THIS INCREASE RESULTED PRIMARILY FROM AN INCREASE IN ADVERTISING\nREVENUES GENERATED BY GOOGLE WEBSITES AND GOOGLE NETWORK MEMBERS\u0092 WEBSITES. THE INCREASE IN ADVERTISING REVENUES FOR GOOGLE WEBSITES AND GOOGLE NETWORK MEMBERS\u0092 WEBSITES RESULTED PRIMARILY FROM AN INCREASE IN THE NUMBER OF PAID CLICKS\nTHROUGH OUR ADVERTISING PROGRAMS AND, TO A LESSER EXTENT, AN INCREASE IN THE AVERAGE COST-PER-CLICK PAID BY OUR ADVERTISERS. THE INCREASE IN THE NUMBER OF PAID CLICKS GENERATED THROUGH OUR ADVERTISING PROGRAMS WAS DUE TO AN INCREASE IN AGGREGATE\nTRAFFIC, CERTAIN MONETIZATION IMPROVEMENTS INCLUDING NEW AD FORMATS, AND THE CONTINUED GLOBAL EXPANSION OF OUR PRODUCTS, AND OUR ADVERTISER AND USER BASE, AS WELL AS AN INCREASE IN THE NUMBER OF GOOGLE NETWORK MEMBERS. THE INCREASE IN THE AVERAGE\nCOST-PER-CLICK PAID BY OUR ADVERTISERS WAS PRIMARILY DRIVEN BY THE INCREASED SPENDING FROM ADVERTISERS AND A GENERAL WEAKENING OF THE U.S DOLLAR COMPARED TO FOREIGN CURRENCIES (PRIMARILY THE EURO, JAPANESE YEN, AND BRITISH POUND), PARTIALLY OFFSET\nBY THE\n33\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nCHANGES IN GEOGRAPHICAL MIX DUE TO TRAFFIC GROWTH IN EMERGING MARKETS, WHERE THE AVERAGE COST-PER-CLICK IS TYPICALLY LOWER, COMPARED TO MORE MATURE MARKETS. IN ADDITION, THE INCREASE IN\nADVERTISING REVENUES FOR GOOGLE NETWORK MEMBERS\u0092 WEBSITES FROM 2010 TO 2011 WAS PARTIALLY OFFSET BY THE LOSS OF A SEARCH PARTNERSHIP AND, TO A LESSER EXTENT, BY A SEARCH QUALITY IMPROVEMENT MADE DURING THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2011.\nIMPROVEMENTS IN OUR ABILITY TO ULTIMATELY MONETIZE INCREASED TRAFFIC PRIMARILY RELATE TO ENHANCING THE END USER EXPERIENCE, INCLUDING PROVIDING END\nUSERS WITH ADS THAT ARE MORE RELEVANT TO THEIR SEARCH QUERIES OR TO THE CONTENT ON THE GOOGLE NETWORK MEMBERS\u0092 WEBSITES THEY VISIT. FOR INSTANCE, THESE IMPROVEMENTS INCLUDE INCREASING SITE LINKS TO BE FULL SIZE LINKS WITH THE URL (UNIFORM\nRESOURCE LOCATOR), MOVING A PORTION OF THE FIRST LINE OF THE AD TO THE HEADING TO BETTER PROMOTE THE CONTENT OF THE AD, PROVIDING AN OPTION TO PREVIEW THE AD, AND MOVING THE AD\u0092S URL TO A SEPARATE LINE BELOW THE HEADING FOR GREATER\nPAGE FORMAT CONSISTENCY.\nAGGREGATE PAID CLICKS ON GOOGLE WEBSITES AND GOOGLE NETWORK MEMBERS\u0092 WEBSITES INCREASED APPROXIMATELY 34%\nFROM 2011 TO 2012 AND APPROXIMATELY 25% FROM 2010 TO 2011. AVERAGE COST-PER-CLICK ON GOOGLE WEBSITES AND GOOGLE NETWORK MEMBERS\u0092 WEBSITES DECREASED APPROXIMATELY 12% FROM 2011 TO 2012 AND INCREASED APPROXIMATELY 3% FROM 2010 TO 2011. THE RATE\nOF CHANGE IN AGGREGATE PAID CLICKS AND AVERAGE COST-PER-CLICK, AND THEIR CORRELATION WITH THE RATE OF CHANGE IN REVENUES, HAS FLUCTUATED AND MAY FLUCTUATE IN THE FUTURE BECAUSE OF VARIOUS FACTORS, INCLUDING THE REVENUE GROWTH RATES ON OUR WEBSITES\nCOMPARED TO THOSE OF OUR GOOGLE NETWORK MEMBERS, ADVERTISER COMPETITION FOR KEYWORDS, CHANGES IN FOREIGN CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATES, SEASONALITY, THE FEES ADVERTISERS ARE WILLING TO PAY BASED ON HOW THEY MANAGE THEIR ADVERTISING COSTS, CHANGES IN\nADVERTISING QUALITY OR FORMATS, AND GENERAL ECONOMIC CONDITIONS. IN ADDITION, TRAFFIC GROWTH IN EMERGING MARKETS COMPARED TO MORE MATURE MARKETS AND ACROSS VARIOUS ADVERTISING VERTICALS AND CHANNELS, INCLUDING MOBILE DEVICES, ALSO CONTRIBUTES TO\nTHESE FLUCTUATIONS. CHANGES IN AGGREGATE PAID CLICKS AND AVERAGE COST-PER-CLICK MAY NOT BE INDICATIVE OF OUR PERFORMANCE OR ADVERTISER EXPERIENCES IN ANY SPECIFIC GEOGRAPHIC MARKET, VERTICAL, OR INDUSTRY.\nWE BELIEVE THAT THE INCREASE IN THE NUMBER OF PAID CLICKS ON GOOGLE WEBSITES AND GOOGLE NETWORK MEMBERS\u0092 WEBSITES IS SUBSTANTIALLY THE RESULT\nOF OUR COMMITMENT TO IMPROVING THE RELEVANCE AND QUALITY OF BOTH OUR SEARCH RESULTS AND THE ADVERTISEMENTS DISPLAYED, WHICH WE BELIEVE RESULTS IN A BETTER USER EXPERIENCE, WHICH IN TURN RESULTS IN MORE SEARCHES, ADVERTISERS, AND GOOGLE NETWORK\nMEMBERS AND OTHER PARTNERS.\nREVENUES BY GEOGRAPHY\nTHE FOLLOWING TABLE PRESENTS OUR GOOGLE DOMESTIC AND INTERNATIONAL REVENUES AS A PERCENTAGE OF GOOGLE REVENUES, DETERMINED BASED ON THE BILLING ADDRESSES OF OUR CUSTOMERS FOR OUR GOOGLE BUSINESS.\nYEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31,\n2010\n2011\n2012\nUNITED STATES\n48%\n46%\n46%\nUNITED KINGDOM\n11%\n11%\n11%\nREST OF THE WORLD\n41%\n43%\n43%\nTHE FOLLOWING TABLE PRESENTS OUR CONSOLIDATED DOMESTIC AND INTERNATIONAL REVENUES AS A PERCENTAGE OF CONSOLIDATED\nREVENUES, DETERMINED BASED ON THE BILLING ADDRESSES OF OUR CUSTOMERS FOR OUR GOOGLE BUSINESS, AND SHIPPING ADDRESSES OF OUR CUSTOMERS FOR OUR MOTOROLA MOBILE BUSINESS.\nYEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31,\n2010\n2011\n2012\nUNITED STATES\n48%\n46%\n47%\nUNITED KINGDOM\n11%\n11%\n10%\nREST OF THE WORLD\n41%\n43%\n43%\nTHE GROWTH IN REVENUES FROM THE UNITED STATES AS A PERCENTAGE OF CONSOLIDATED REVENUES FROM 2011 TO 2012 WAS\nPRIMARILY AS A RESULT OF THE INCLUSION OF MOTOROLA MOBILE REVENUES WHICH WERE PRIMARILY GENERATED IN THE UNITED STATES.\n34\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nTHE GENERAL STRENGTHENING OF THE U.S. DOLLAR RELATIVE TO CERTAIN FOREIGN CURRENCIES (PRIMARILY THE\nEURO) FROM 2011 TO 2012 HAD AN UNFAVORABLE IMPACT ON OUR INTERNATIONAL REVENUES.

THIS IS BEFORE CONSIDERATION OF HEDGING GAINS OF $18 MILLION AND $199 MILLION RECOGNIZED TO REVENUES FROM THE UNITED KINGDOM AND THE REST OF THE WORLD IN 2012.\nTHE GENERAL WEAKENING OF THE U.S. DOLLAR RELATIVE TO CERTAIN FOREIGN CURRENCIES (PRIMARILY THE EURO, JAPANESE YEN, AND BRITISH POUND)\nFROM 2010 TO 2011 HAD A FAVORABLE IMPACT ON OUR INTERNATIONAL REVENUES. HAD FOREIGN EXCHANGE RATES REMAINED CONSTANT IN THESE PERIODS, OUR REVENUES FROM THE UNITED KINGDOM WOULD HAVE BEEN $129 MILLION, OR 3.2%, LOWER AND OUR REVENUES FROM THE REST\nOF THE WORLD WOULD HAVE BEEN APPROXIMATELY $834 MILLION, OR 5.1%, LOWER IN 2011. THIS IS BEFORE CONSIDERATION OF HEDGING GAINS OF $9 MILLION AND $34 MILLION RECOGNIZED TO REVENUES FROM THE UNITED KINGDOM AND THE REST OF THE WORLD IN 2011.\nALTHOUGH WE EXPECT TO CONTINUE TO MAKE INVESTMENTS IN INTERNATIONAL MARKETS, THESE INVESTMENTS MAY NOT RESULT IN AN INCREASE IN OUR\nINTERNATIONAL REVENUES AS A PERCENTAGE OF TOTAL REVENUES IN 2013 OR THEREAFTER.

THESE AMOUNTS ARE PRIMARILY BASED ON THE REVENUE SHARE AND FIXED FEE ARRANGEMENTS WITH OUR GOOGLE NETWORK MEMBERS AND DISTRIBUTION PARTNERS.\nCERTAIN DISTRIBUTION ARRANGEMENTS REQUIRE US TO PAY OUR PARTNERS BASED ON A FEE PER ACCESS POINT DELIVERED AND NOT EXCLUSIVELY\u0097OR AT\nALL\u0097BASED ON REVENUE SHARE. THESE FEES ARE NON-REFUNDABLE. FURTHER, THESE ARRANGEMENTS ARE TERMINABLE AT WILL, ALTHOUGH UNDER THE TERMS OF CERTAIN CONTRACTS WE OR OUR DISTRIBUTION PARTNERS MAY BE SUBJECT TO PENALTIES IN THE EVENT OF EARLY\nTERMINATION. WE RECOGNIZE FEES UNDER THESE ARRANGEMENTS OVER THE ESTIMATED USEFUL LIVES OF THE ACCESS POINTS (APPROXIMATELY TWO YEARS) TO THE EXTENT WE CAN REASONABLY ESTIMATE THOSE LIVES AND THEY ARE LONGER THAN ONE YEAR, OR BASED ON ANY\nCONTRACTUAL REVENUE SHARE, IF GREATER. OTHERWISE, THE FEES ARE CHARGED TO EXPENSE AS INCURRED. THE ESTIMATED USEFUL LIFE OF THE ACCESS POINTS IS BASED ON THE HISTORICAL AVERAGE PERIOD OF TIME THEY GENERATE TRAFFIC AND REVENUES.\nCOST OF REVENUES ALSO INCLUDES THE EXPENSES ASSOCIATED WITH THE OPERATION OF OUR DATA CENTERS, INCLUDING DEPRECIATION, LABOR, ENERGY, AND BANDWIDTH\nCOSTS, CREDIT CARD AND OTHER TRANSACTION FEES RELATED TO PROCESSING CUSTOMER TRANSACTIONS, AMORTIZATION OF ACQUIRED INTANGIBLE ASSETS, AS WELL AS CONTENT ACQUISITION COSTS.

ADDITIONALLY, THERE WAS AN INCREASE IN TRAFFIC ACQUISITION COSTS OF $2,145 MILLION RESULTING FROM MORE ADVERTISER FEES GENERATED THROUGH OUR ADSENSE\nPROGRAM, MORE TRAFFIC DIRECTED TO OUR WEBSITES, AS WELL AS MORE DISTRIBUTION FEES PAID. THE REMAINING INCREASE WAS PRIMARILY DRIVEN BY INCREASE IN DATA CENTER COSTS, HARDWARE PRODUCT COSTS AND CONTENT ACQUISITION COSTS.

IN ADDITION, WE RECORDED AN IMPAIRMENT CHARGE OF $110 MILLION RELATED TO\nCERTAIN EQUITY INVESTMENTS DURING THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2011.\nTHE COSTS OF OUR FOREIGN EXCHANGE HEDGING ACTIVITIES THAT WE\nRECOGNIZED TO INTEREST AND OTHER INCOME, NET ARE PRIMARILY A FUNCTION OF THE NOTIONAL AMOUNT OF THE OPTION AND FORWARD CONTRACTS AND THEIR RELATED DURATION, THE MOVEMENT OF THE FOREIGN EXCHANGE RATES RELATIVE TO THE STRIKE PRICES OF THE CONTRACTS,\nAS WELL AS THE VOLATILITY OF THE FOREIGN EXCHANGE RATES.\nAS WE EXPAND OUR INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS, WE BELIEVE COSTS RELATED TO HEDGING\nACTIVITIES UNDER OUR FOREIGN EXCHANGE RISK MANAGEMENT PROGRAM MAY INCREASE IN DOLLAR AMOUNT IN 2013 AND FUTURE PERIODS.\n39\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nPROVISION FOR INCOME TAXES\nTHE FOLLOWING TABLE PRESENTS OUR PROVISION FOR INCOME TAXES, AND EFFECTIVE TAX RATE FOR THE PERIODS PRESENTED (DOLLARS IN MILLIONS).\nYEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31,\n2010\n2011\n2012\nPROVISION FOR INCOME TAXES\n$2,291\n$2,589\n$2,598\nEFFECTIVE TAX RATE\n21.2%\n21.0%\n19.4%\nOUR PROVISION FOR INCOME TAXES INCREASED FROM 2011 TO 2012, PRIMARILY AS A RESULT OF INCREASES IN FEDERAL INCOME\nTAXES, DRIVEN BY HIGHER TAXABLE INCOME YEAR OVER YEAR AND EXPIRATION OF THE FEDERAL RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT CREDIT, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY PROPORTIONATELY MORE EARNINGS REALIZED IN COUNTRIES THAT HAVE LOWER STATUTORY TAX RATES. OUR EFFECTIVE TAX\nRATE DECREASED FROM 2011 TO 2012, PRIMARILY AS A RESULT OF PROPORTIONATELY MORE EARNINGS REALIZED IN COUNTRIES THAT HAVE LOWER STATUTORY TAX RATES AS WELL AS A DISCRETE ITEM RELATED TO AN INVESTIGATION BY THE DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE RECOGNIZED IN\n2011, WHICH WAS NOT DEDUCTIBLE FOR INCOME TAX PURPOSES.\nOUR PROVISION FOR INCOME TAXES INCREASED FROM 2010 TO 2011, PRIMARILY AS A\nRESULT OF INCREASES IN FEDERAL INCOME TAXES, DRIVEN BY HIGHER TAXABLE INCOME YEAR OVER YEAR, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY PROPORTIONATELY MORE EARNINGS REALIZED IN COUNTRIES THAT HAVE LOWER STATUTORY TAX RATES. OUR EFFECTIVE TAX RATE DECREASED FROM 2010\nTO 2011, PRIMARILY AS A RESULT OF PROPORTIONATELY MORE EARNINGS REALIZED IN COUNTRIES THAT HAVE LOWER STATUTORY TAX RATES, A DECREASE IN STATE INCOME TAXES, AND AN INCREASE IN FEDERAL RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT CREDITS RECOGNIZED IN 2011, PARTIALLY\nOFFSET BY RECOGNITION OF A CHARGE RELATED TO THE RESOLUTION OF AN INVESTIGATION BY THE DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE WHICH IS NOT DEDUCTIBLE FOR TAX PURPOSES.\nTHE FEDERAL RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT CREDIT EXPIRED ON DECEMBER 31, 2011. ON JANUARY 2, 2013, THE AMERICAN TAXPAYER RELIEF ACT OF 2012 WAS SIGNED INTO LAW. UNDER THIS ACT, THE FEDERAL RESEARCH AND\nDEVELOPMENT CREDIT WAS RETROACTIVELY EXTENDED FOR AMOUNTS PAID OR INCURRED AFTER DECEMBER 31, 2011 AND BEFORE JANUARY 1, 2014. THE EFFECTS OF THESE CHANGES IN THE TAX LAW WILL RESULT IN A TAX BENEFIT WHICH WILL BE RECOGNIZED IN THE FIRST\nQUARTER OF 2013, WHICH IS THE QUARTER IN WHICH THE LAW WAS ENACTED.\nOUR EFFECTIVE TAX RATE COULD FLUCTUATE SIGNIFICANTLY ON A QUARTERLY\nBASIS AND COULD BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED TO THE EXTENT EARNINGS ARE LOWER THAN ANTICIPATED IN COUNTRIES THAT HAVE LOWER STATUTORY RATES AND HIGHER THAN ANTICIPATED IN COUNTRIES THAT HAVE HIGHER STATUTORY RATES. OUR EFFECTIVE TAX RATE COULD ALSO\nFLUCTUATE DUE TO THE NET GAINS AND LOSSES RECOGNIZED BY LEGAL ENTITIES ON CERTAIN HEDGES AND RELATED HEDGED INTERCOMPANY AND OTHER TRANSACTIONS UNDER OUR FOREIGN EXCHANGE RISK MANAGEMENT PROGRAM, BY CHANGES IN THE VALUATION OF OUR DEFERRED TAX\nASSETS OR LIABILITIES, OR BY CHANGES IN TAX LAWS, REGULATIONS, OR ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES, AS WELL AS CERTAIN DISCRETE ITEMS. IN ADDITION, WE ARE SUBJECT TO THE CONTINUOUS EXAMINATION OF OUR INCOME TAX RETURNS BY THE INTERNAL REVENUE SERVICE (IRS) AND\nOTHER TAX AUTHORITIES.

CASH\nEQUIVALENTS AND MARKETABLE SECURITIES ARE COMPRISED OF TIME DEPOSITS, MONEY MARKET AND OTHER FUNDS, INCLUDING CASH COLLATERAL RECEIVED RELATED TO OUR SECURITIES LENDING PROGRAM, HIGHLY LIQUID DEBT INSTRUMENTS OF THE U.S. GOVERNMENT AND ITS AGENCIES,\nDEBT INSTRUMENTS ISSUED BY FOREIGN GOVERNMENTS, AND MUNICIPALITIES IN THE U.S., CORPORATE SECURITIES, MORTGAGE-BACKED SECURITIES AND ASSET-BACKED SECURITIES.\nAS OF DECEMBER 31, 2012, $31.4 BILLION OF THE $48.1 BILLION OF CASH, CASH EQUIVALENTS, AND MARKETABLE SECURITIES WAS HELD BY OUR FOREIGN SUBSIDIARIES. IF THESE FUNDS ARE NEEDED FOR OUR OPERATIONS IN THE U.S.,\nWE WOULD BE REQUIRED TO\n43\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nACCRUE AND PAY U.S. TAXES TO REPATRIATE THESE FUNDS. HOWEVER, OUR INTENT IS TO PERMANENTLY REINVEST THESE FUNDS OUTSIDE OF THE U.S. AND OUR CURRENT PLANS DO NOT DEMONSTRATE A NEED TO REPATRIATE\nTHEM TO FUND OUR U.S. OPERATIONS.\nOUR PRINCIPAL SOURCES OF LIQUIDITY ARE OUR CASH, CASH EQUIVALENTS, AND MARKETABLE SECURITIES, AS WELL\nAS THE CASH FLOW THAT WE GENERATE FROM OUR OPERATIONS. AT DECEMBER 31, 2012, WE HAD UNUSED LETTERS OF CREDIT FOR APPROXIMATELY $89 MILLION. WE BELIEVE THAT OUR SOURCES OF FUNDING WILL BE SUFFICIENT TO SATISFY OUR CURRENTLY ANTICIPATED CASH\nREQUIREMENTS THROUGH AT LEAST THE NEXT 12 MONTHS. OUR LIQUIDITY COULD BE NEGATIVELY AFFECTED BY A DECREASE IN DEMAND FOR OUR PRODUCTS AND SERVICES. IN ADDITION, WE MAY MAKE ACQUISITIONS OR LICENSE PRODUCTS AND TECHNOLOGIES COMPLEMENTARY TO OUR\nBUSINESS AND MAY NEED TO RAISE ADDITIONAL CAPITAL THROUGH FUTURE DEBT OR EQUITY FINANCING TO PROVIDE FOR GREATER FLEXIBILITY TO FUND ANY SUCH ACQUISITIONS AND LICENSING ACTIVITIES. ADDITIONAL FINANCING MAY NOT BE AVAILABLE AT ALL OR ON TERMS\nFAVORABLE TO US.\nWE HAVE A DEBT FINANCING PROGRAM OF UP TO $3.0 BILLION THROUGH THE ISSUANCE OF COMMERCIAL PAPER. NET PROCEEDS\nFROM THIS PROGRAM ARE USED FOR GENERAL CORPORATE PURPOSES. AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2012, WE HAD $2.5 BILLION OF COMMERCIAL PAPER OUTSTANDING RECORDED AS SHORT-TERM DEBT, WITH A WEIGHTED-AVERAGE INTEREST RATE OF 0.2% THAT MATURE AT VARIOUS DATES\nTHROUGH 2013. AVERAGE COMMERCIAL PAPER BORROWINGS DURING THE YEAR WERE $2.2 BILLION AND THE MAXIMUM AMOUNT OUTSTANDING DURING THE YEAR WAS $2.7 BILLION. IN CONJUNCTION WITH THIS PROGRAM, WE HAVE A $3.0 BILLION REVOLVING CREDIT FACILITY\nEXPIRING IN JULY 2016. THE INTEREST RATE FOR THE CREDIT FACILITY IS DETERMINED BASED ON A FORMULA USING CERTAIN MARKET RATES. AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2012, WE WERE IN COMPLIANCE WITH THE FINANCIAL COVENANT IN THE CREDIT FACILITY AND NO AMOUNTS WERE\nOUTSTANDING.\nIN MAY 2011, WE ISSUED $3.0 BILLION OF UNSECURED SENIOR NOTES IN THREE EQUAL TRANCHES, DUE IN 2014, 2016,\nAND 2021, WITH STATED INTEREST RATES OF 1.25%, 2.125%, AND 3.625%. THE NET PROCEEDS FROM THE SALE OF THE NOTES WERE USED TO REPAY A PORTION OF OUR OUTSTANDING COMMERCIAL PAPER AND FOR GENERAL CORPORATE PURPOSES. AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2012,\nTHE TOTAL CARRYING VALUE AND ESTIMATED FAIR VALUE OF THESE NOTES WERE $3.0 BILLION AND $3.2 BILLION. THE ESTIMATED FAIR VALUE WAS BASED ON QUOTED PRICES FOR OUR PUBLICLY-TRADED DEBT AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2012. WE ARE NOT SUBJECT TO ANY FINANCIAL\nCOVENANTS UNDER THE NOTES.\nCASH PROVIDED BY OPERATING ACTIVITIES\nCASH PROVIDED BY OPERATING ACTIVITIES CONSIST OF NET INCOME ADJUSTED FOR CERTAIN NON-CASH ITEMS, INCLUDING AMORTIZATION, DEPRECIATION, DEFERRED\nINCOME TAXES, EXCESS TAX BENEFITS FROM STOCK-BASED AWARD ACTIVITIES, STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION EXPENSE, AS WELL AS THE EFFECT OF CHANGES IN WORKING CAPITAL AND OTHER ACTIVITIES.\nCASH PROVIDED BY OPERATING ACTIVITIES IN 2012 WAS $16,619 MILLION AND CONSISTED OF NET INCOME OF $10,737 MILLION, ADJUSTMENTS FOR NON-CASH ITEMS OF\n$5,172 MILLION, A GAIN ON DIVESTITURE OF BUSINESS OF $188 MILLION AND INCREASE IN CASH FROM CHANGES IN WORKING CAPITAL AND OTHER ACTIVITIES OF $898 MILLION.

IN ADDITION, THE INCREASE IN CASH FROM CHANGES IN WORKING CAPITAL ACTIVITIES PRIMARILY CONSISTED OF AN INCREASE IN INCOME TAXES, NET, OF $1,492 MILLION INCLUDING ADDITIONAL TAX OBLIGATIONS\nACCRUED, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY AN INCREASE IN THE AMOUNT OF ESTIMATED INCOME TAXES WE PAID DURING THE YEAR, AN INCREASE IN ACCRUED EXPENSES AND OTHER LIABILITIES OF $762 MILLION, A DECREASE IN INVENTORIES OF $301 MILLION, AN INCREASE ACCRUED REVENUE\nSHARE OF $299 MILLION, AND AN INCREASE IN DEFERRED REVENUE OF $163 MILLION. THESE CHANGES WERE PARTIALLY OFFSET BY AN INCREASE IN PREPAID REVENUE SHARE, EXPENSES, AND OTHER ASSETS OF $833 MILLION INCLUDING PREPAYMENTS FOR CERTAIN CONTENT\nARRANGEMENTS, AN INCREASE OF ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE OF $787 MILLION DUE TO GROWTH IN FEES BILLED TO OUR CUSTOMERS, AND A DECREASE IN ACCOUNTS PAYABLE OF $499 MILLION DUE TO THE TIMING OF INVOICE PROCESSING AND PAYMENTS.\nCASH PROVIDED BY OPERATING ACTIVITIES IN 2011 WAS $14,565 MILLION AND CONSISTED OF NET INCOME OF $9,737 MILLION, ADJUSTMENTS FOR NON-CASH ITEMS OF\n$4,198 MILLION, AND INCREASE IN CASH FROM CHANGES IN WORKING CAPITAL AND OTHER ACTIVITIES OF $630 MILLION.

IN ADDITION, THE INCREASE IN CASH FROM CHANGES IN WORKING CAPITAL\nACTIVITIES PRIMARILY CONSISTED OF AN INCREASE IN ACCRUED EXPENSES AND OTHER LIABILITIES OF $795 MILLION, A NET INCREASE IN INCOME TAXES PAYABLE AND DEFERRED INCOME TAXES OF $731 MILLION, AN INCREASE IN ACCRUED REVENUE SHARE OF $259 MILLION, AN\nINCREASE OF $162 MILLION IN DEFERRED REVENUE, AND AN INCREASE OF $101 MILLION IN ACCOUNTS PAYABLE. THESE INCREASES WERE PARTIALLY OFFSET BY AN INCREASE IN ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE OF $1,156 MILLION DUE TO THE GROWTH IN FEES BILLED TO OUR ADVERTISERS, AND\nAN INCREASE IN PREPAID REVENUE SHARE, EXPENSES AND OTHER ASSETS OF $262 MILLION. THE INCREASE IN INCOME TAXES PAYABLE AND DEFERRED INCOME TAXES REFLECTED PRIMARILY ADDITIONAL TAX OBLIGATIONS ACCRUED, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY ESTIMATED INCOME TAXES PAID\nDURING 2011. IN ADDITION, WE PAID $500 MILLION RELATED TO THE RESOLUTION OF A DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE INVESTIGATION DURING THE YEAR.\nCASH\nPROVIDED BY OPERATING ACTIVITIES IN 2010 WAS $11,081 MILLION, AND CONSISTED OF NET INCOME OF $8,505 MILLION, ADJUSTMENTS FOR NON-CASH ITEMS OF $2,675 MILLION, AND DECREASE IN CASH FROM CHANGES IN WORKING CAPITAL AND OTHER ACTIVITIES OF $99 MILLION.\nADJUSTMENTS FOR NON-CASH ITEMS PRIMARILY CONSISTED OF $1,376 MILLION OF STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION EXPENSE, $1,067 MILLION OF DEPRECIATION AND AMORTIZATION EXPENSE ON PROPERTY AND EQUIPMENT, AND $329 MILLION OF AMORTIZATION OF INTANGIBLE AND OTHER\nASSETS, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY $94 MILLION OF EXCESS TAX BENEFITS FROM STOCK-BASED AWARD ACTIVITIES. IN ADDITION, THE DECREASE IN CASH FROM CHANGES IN WORKING CAPITAL ACTIVITIES PRIMARILY CONSISTED OF AN INCREASE OF $1,129 MILLION IN ACCOUNTS\nRECEIVABLE DUE TO THE GROWTH IN FEES BILLED TO OUR ADVERTISERS AND AN INCREASE OF $414 MILLION IN PREPAID REVENUE SHARE, EXPENSES AND OTHER ASSETS. THESE INCREASES WERE PARTIALLY OFFSET BY AN INCREASE IN ACCRUED EXPENSES AND OTHER LIABILITIES OF\n$745 MILLION, AN INCREASE IN ACCOUNTS PAYABLE OF $272 MILLION, AN INCREASE IN ACCRUED REVENUE SHARE OF $214 MILLION, AN INCREASE IN DEFERRED REVENUE OF $111 MILLION, AND A NET INCREASE IN INCOME TAX PAYABLE AND DEFERRED INCOME TAXES OF $102 MILLION,\nWHICH INCLUDES THE SAME $94 MILLION OF EXCESS TAX BENEFITS FROM STOCK-BASED AWARD ACTIVITIES INCLUDED UNDER ADJUSTMENTS FOR NON-CASH ITEMS. THE INCREASE IN ACCRUED EXPENSE AND OTHER LIABILITIES, ACCOUNTS PAYABLE, ACCRUED REVENUE SHARE, AND DEFERRED\nREVENUES ARE PRIMARILY A RESULT OF THE GROWTH IN OUR BUSINESS AND HEADCOUNT. THE INCREASE IN NET INCOME TAXES PAYABLE AND DEFERRED INCOME TAXES WAS PRIMARILY A RESULT OF ADDITIONAL TAX OBLIGATIONS ACCRUED, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY THE RELEASE OF CERTAIN\nTAX RESERVES AS A RESULT OF THE SETTLEMENT OF OUR TAX AUDITS FOR OUR 2005 AND 2006 TAX YEARS.\nAS WE EXPAND OUR BUSINESS\nINTERNATIONALLY, WE HAVE OFFERED PAYMENT TERMS TO CERTAIN ADVERTISERS THAT ARE STANDARD IN THEIR LOCALES BUT LONGER THAN TERMS WE WOULD GENERALLY OFFER TO OUR DOMESTIC ADVERTISERS. IN ADDITION, WE CONTINUE TO EVALUATE OUR MOTOROLA RESTRUCTURING\nPLAN, AND MAY INCUR ADDITIONAL CHARGES, SOME OF WHICH MAY BE SIGNIFICANT. THIS MAY INCREASE OUR WORKING CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS AND MAY HAVE A NEGATIVE EFFECT ON CASH PROVIDED BY OUR OPERATING ACTIVITIES.\nCASH USED IN INVESTING ACTIVITIES\nCASH USED IN INVESTING ACTIVITIES IN 2012 OF $13,056 MILLION WAS PRIMARILY ATTRIBUTABLE TO CASH USED IN ACQUISITIONS AND OTHER INVESTMENTS OF $11,264 MILLION, INCLUDING $9,518 MILLION NET CASH PAID IN CONNECTION\nWITH THE ACQUISITION OF MOTOROLA, AND CAPITAL EXPENDITURES OF $3,273 MILLION RELATED PRIMARILY TO OUR FACILITIES, DATA CENTERS, AND RELATED EQUIPMENT. THESE DECREASES WERE PARTIALLY OFFSET BY NET MATURITIES AND SALES OF MARKETABLE SECURITIES OF\n$1,770 MILLION. ALSO, IN CONNECTION WITH OUR SECURITIES LENDING PROGRAM, WE RETURNED CASH COLLATERAL OF $334 MILLION.

ALSO, IN CONNECTION WITH OUR SECURITIES LENDING PROGRAM, WE RETURNED $354 MILLION OF CASH COLLATERAL.\nCASH USED IN INVESTING ACTIVITIES IN 2010 OF $10,680 MILLION WAS PRIMARILY ATTRIBUTABLE TO NET PURCHASES OF MARKETABLE SECURITIES OF $6,886\nMILLION, CAPITAL EXPENDITURES OF $4,018 MILLION OF WHICH $1.8 BILLION WAS FOR THE\n45\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nPURCHASE OF AN OFFICE BUILDING IN NEW YORK CITY IN DECEMBER 2010, AND REMAINING AMOUNTS RELATED PRINCIPALLY TO OUR DATA CENTERS AND RELATED EQUIPMENT, AND CASH CONSIDERATION USED IN ACQUISITIONS\nAND OTHER INVESTMENTS OF $1,067 MILLION. ALSO, IN CONNECTION WITH OUR SECURITIES LENDING PROGRAM, WE RECEIVED $2,361 MILLION OF CASH COLLATERAL WHICH WAS INVESTED IN REVERSE REPURCHASE AGREEMENTS.\nIN ORDER TO MANAGE EXPECTED INCREASES IN INTERNET TRAFFIC, ADVERTISING TRANSACTIONS, AND NEW PRODUCTS AND SERVICES, AND TO SUPPORT OUR OVERALL\nGLOBAL BUSINESS EXPANSION, WE EXPECT TO MAKE SIGNIFICANT INVESTMENTS IN OUR SYSTEMS, DATA CENTERS, CORPORATE FACILITIES, INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY INFRASTRUCTURE, AND EMPLOYEES IN 2013 AND THEREAFTER. HOWEVER, THE AMOUNT OF OUR CAPITAL EXPENDITURES HAS\nFLUCTUATED AND MAY CONTINUE TO FLUCTUATE ON A QUARTERLY BASIS.\nIN ADDITION, WE EXPECT TO SPEND A SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT OF CASH ON\nACQUISITIONS AND OTHER INVESTMENTS FROM TIME TO TIME.

IN DOING SO, WE HAVE TO MAKE ESTIMATES AND ASSUMPTIONS THAT AFFECT OUR REPORTED\nAMOUNTS OF ASSETS, LIABILITIES, REVENUES, AND EXPENSES, AS WELL AS RELATED DISCLOSURE OF CONTINGENT ASSETS AND LIABILITIES. IN SOME CASES, WE COULD REASONABLY HAVE USED DIFFERENT ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES. IN SOME CASES, CHANGES IN THE\nACCOUNTING ESTIMATES ARE REASONABLY LIKELY TO OCCUR FROM PERIOD TO PERIOD. ACCORDINGLY, ACTUAL RESULTS COULD DIFFER MATERIALLY FROM OUR ESTIMATES. TO THE EXTENT THAT THERE ARE MATERIAL DIFFERENCES BETWEEN THESE ESTIMATES AND ACTUAL RESULTS, OUR\nFINANCIAL CONDITION OR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS WILL BE AFFECTED. WE BASE OUR ESTIMATES ON PAST EXPERIENCE AND OTHER ASSUMPTIONS THAT WE BELIEVE ARE REASONABLE UNDER THE CIRCUMSTANCES, AND WE EVALUATE THESE ESTIMATES ON AN ONGOING BASIS. WE REFER TO\nACCOUNTING ESTIMATES OF THIS TYPE AS CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES, WHICH WE DISCUSS FURTHER BELOW. WE HAVE REVIEWED OUR CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES WITH THE AUDIT COMMITTEE OF OUR BOARD OF DIRECTORS.\n47\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nINCOME TAXES\nWE ARE SUBJECT TO INCOME TAXES IN THE U.S. AND NUMEROUS FOREIGN JURISDICTIONS. SIGNIFICANT JUDGMENT IS REQUIRED IN EVALUATING OUR UNCERTAIN TAX POSITIONS AND DETERMINING OUR PROVISION FOR INCOME TAXES.\nALTHOUGH WE BELIEVE WE HAVE ADEQUATELY RESERVED FOR OUR UNCERTAIN TAX POSITIONS, NO ASSURANCE CAN BE GIVEN THAT THE FINAL TAX OUTCOME OF THESE\nMATTERS WILL NOT BE DIFFERENT. WE ADJUST THESE RESERVES IN LIGHT OF CHANGING FACTS AND CIRCUMSTANCES, SUCH AS THE CLOSING OF A TAX AUDIT OR THE REFINEMENT OF AN ESTIMATE. TO THE EXTENT THAT THE FINAL TAX OUTCOME OF THESE MATTERS IS DIFFERENT THAN\nTHE AMOUNTS RECORDED, SUCH DIFFERENCES WILL IMPACT THE PROVISION FOR INCOME TAXES IN THE PERIOD IN WHICH SUCH DETERMINATION IS MADE. THE PROVISION FOR INCOME TAXES INCLUDES THE IMPACT OF RESERVE PROVISIONS AND CHANGES TO RESERVES THAT ARE CONSIDERED\nAPPROPRIATE, AS WELL AS THE RELATED NET INTEREST.\nOUR EFFECTIVE TAX RATES HAVE DIFFERED FROM THE STATUTORY RATE PRIMARILY DUE TO THE\nTAX IMPACT OF FOREIGN OPERATIONS, STATE TAXES, CERTAIN BENEFITS REALIZED RELATED TO STOCK-BASED AWARD ACTIVITIES, AND RESEARCH AND EXPERIMENTATION TAX CREDITS. THE EFFECTIVE TAX RATES WERE 21.2%, 21.0%, AND 19.4% FOR 2010, 2011, AND 2012. OUR FUTURE\nEFFECTIVE TAX RATES COULD BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED BY EARNINGS BEING LOWER THAN ANTICIPATED IN COUNTRIES THAT HAVE LOWER STATUTORY RATES AND HIGHER THAN ANTICIPATED IN COUNTRIES THAT HAVE HIGHER STATUTORY RATES, THE NET GAINS AND LOSSES RECOGNIZED BY\nLEGAL ENTITIES ON CERTAIN HEDGES AND RELATED HEDGED INTERCOMPANY AND OTHER TRANSACTIONS UNDER OUR FOREIGN EXCHANGE RISK MANAGEMENT PROGRAM, CHANGES IN THE VALUATION OF OUR DEFERRED TAX ASSETS OR LIABILITIES, OR CHANGES IN TAX LAWS, REGULATIONS, OR\nACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES, AS WELL AS CERTAIN DISCRETE ITEMS. IN ADDITION, WE ARE SUBJECT TO THE CONTINUOUS EXAMINATION OF OUR INCOME TAX RETURNS BY THE IRS AND OTHER TAX AUTHORITIES. WE REGULARLY ASSESS THE LIKELIHOOD OF ADVERSE OUTCOMES RESULTING FROM\nTHESE EXAMINATIONS TO DETERMINE THE ADEQUACY OF OUR PROVISION FOR INCOME TAXES.\nLOSS CONTINGENCIES\nWE ARE REGULARLY SUBJECT TO CLAIMS, SUITS, GOVERNMENT INVESTIGATIONS, AND OTHER PROCEEDINGS INVOLVING COMPETITION AND ANTITRUST, INTELLECTUAL\nPROPERTY, PRIVACY, TAX, LABOR AND EMPLOYMENT, COMMERCIAL DISPUTES, CONTENT GENERATED BY OUR USERS, GOODS AND SERVICES OFFERED BY ADVERTISERS OR PUBLISHERS USING OUR PLATFORMS, AND OTHER MATTERS. CERTAIN OF THESE MATTERS INCLUDE SPECULATIVE CLAIMS\nFOR SUBSTANTIAL OR INDETERMINATE AMOUNTS OF DAMAGES. WE RECORD A LIABILITY WHEN WE BELIEVE THAT IT IS BOTH PROBABLE THAT A LOSS HAS BEEN INCURRED, AND THE AMOUNT CAN BE REASONABLY ESTIMATED. WE EVALUATE, ON A MONTHLY BASIS, DEVELOPMENTS IN OUR LEGAL\nMATTERS THAT COULD AFFECT THE AMOUNT OF LIABILITY THAT HAS BEEN PREVIOUSLY ACCRUED, AND MAKE ADJUSTMENTS AS APPROPRIATE. SIGNIFICANT JUDGMENT IS REQUIRED TO DETERMINE BOTH LIKELIHOOD OF THERE BEING AND THE ESTIMATED AMOUNT OF A LOSS RELATED TO SUCH\nMATTERS. UNTIL THE FINAL RESOLUTION OF SUCH MATTERS, THERE MAY BE AN EXPOSURE TO LOSS IN EXCESS OF THE AMOUNT RECORDED, AND SUCH AMOUNTS COULD BE MATERIAL. SHOULD ANY OF OUR ESTIMATES AND ASSUMPTIONS CHANGE OR PROVE TO HAVE BEEN INCORRECT, IT COULD\nHAVE A MATERIAL IMPACT ON OUR BUSINESS, CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL POSITION, RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, OR CASH FLOWS. SEE NOTE 11 OF NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS INCLUDED IN ITEM 8 OF THIS ANNUAL REPORT ON FORM 10-K FOR ADDITIONAL\nINFORMATION REGARDING CONTINGENCIES.\nBUSINESS COMBINATIONS\nWE ALLOCATE THE FAIR VALUE OF PURCHASE CONSIDERATION TO THE TANGIBLE ASSETS ACQUIRED, LIABILITIES ASSUMED AND INTANGIBLE ASSETS ACQUIRED BASED ON\nTHEIR ESTIMATED FAIR VALUES. THE EXCESS OF THE FAIR VALUE OF PURCHASE CONSIDERATION OVER THE FAIR VALUES OF THESE IDENTIFIABLE ASSETS AND LIABILITIES IS RECORDED AS GOODWILL. WHEN DETERMINING THE FAIR VALUES OF ASSETS ACQUIRED AND LIABILITIES\nASSUMED, MANAGEMENT MAKES SIGNIFICANT ESTIMATES AND ASSUMPTIONS, ESPECIALLY WITH RESPECT TO INTANGIBLE ASSETS.\nCRITICAL ESTIMATES IN\nVALUING CERTAIN INTANGIBLE ASSETS INCLUDE BUT ARE NOT LIMITED TO FUTURE EXPECTED CASH FLOWS FROM CUSTOMER RELATIONSHIPS AND ACQUIRED PATENTS AND DEVELOPED TECHNOLOGY; AND DISCOUNT RATES. MANAGEMENT\u0092S ESTIMATES OF FAIR VALUE ARE BASED UPON\nASSUMPTIONS BELIEVED TO BE REASONABLE, BUT WHICH ARE INHERENTLY UNCERTAIN AND UNPREDICTABLE AND, AS A RESULT, ACTUAL RESULTS MAY DIFFER FROM ESTIMATES.\n48\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nOTHER ESTIMATES ASSOCIATED WITH THE ACCOUNTING FOR ACQUISITIONS MAY CHANGE AS ADDITIONAL INFORMATION\nBECOMES AVAILABLE REGARDING THE ASSETS ACQUIRED AND LIABILITIES ASSUMED, AS MORE FULLY DISCUSSED IN NOTE 6 OF NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS INCLUDED IN ITEM 8 OF THIS ANNUAL REPORT ON FORM 10-K.\nIMPAIRMENT OF MARKETABLE AND NON-MARKETABLE SECURITIES\nWE PERIODICALLY REVIEW OUR MARKETABLE AND NON-MARKETABLE SECURITIES FOR IMPAIRMENT. IF WE CONCLUDE THAT ANY OF THESE INVESTMENTS ARE IMPAIRED, WE DETERMINE WHETHER SUCH IMPAIRMENT IS OTHER-THAN-TEMPORARY. FACTORS\nWE CONSIDER TO MAKE SUCH DETERMINATION INCLUDE THE DURATION AND SEVERITY OF THE IMPAIRMENT, THE REASON FOR THE DECLINE IN VALUE AND THE POTENTIAL RECOVERY PERIOD AND OUR INTENT TO SELL. FOR MARKETABLE DEBT SECURITIES, WE ALSO CONSIDER WHETHER (1) IT\nIS MORE LIKELY THAN NOT THAT WE WILL BE REQUIRED TO SELL THE SECURITY BEFORE RECOVERY OF ITS AMORTIZED COST BASIS, AND (2) THE AMORTIZED COST BASIS CANNOT BE RECOVERED AS A RESULT OF CREDIT LOSSES. IF ANY IMPAIRMENT IS CONSIDERED\nOTHER-THAN-TEMPORARY, WE WILL WRITE DOWN THE ASSET TO ITS FAIR VALUE AND RECORD THE CORRESPONDING CHARGE AS INTEREST AND OTHER INCOME, NET.\nPRIOR PERIOD RECLASSIFICATION\nPRIOR PERIOD BALANCE RELATED TO INVENTORIES HAS BEEN\nRECLASSIFIED TO CONFORM TO THE CURRENT YEAR PRESENTATION.","22111":"ITEM 7.\nMANAGEMENT\u0092S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nFORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS\nIN\nADDITION TO CURRENT AND HISTORICAL INFORMATION, THIS ANNUAL REPORT ON FORM 10-K CONTAINS FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS WITHIN THE MEANING OF THE PRIVATE SECURITIES LITIGATION REFORM ACT OF 1995.

REVENUE EX-TAC IS A NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURE DEFINED AS GAAP REVENUE LESS TAC. TAC CONSISTS OF PAYMENTS MADE TO AFFILIATES THAT HAVE INTEGRATED OUR ADVERTISING OFFERINGS INTO THEIR SITES AND PAYMENTS MADE TO COMPANIES THAT DIRECT\nCONSUMER AND BUSINESS TRAFFIC TO YAHOO! PROPERTIES. BASED ON THE TERMS OF THE SEARCH AGREEMENT WITH MICROSOFT DESCRIBED UNDER \u0093SIGNIFICANT TRANSACTIONS\u0094 BELOW, MICROSOFT RETAINS A REVENUE SHARE OF 12 PERCENT OF THE NET (AFTER TAC) SEARCH\nREVENUE GENERATED ON YAHOO! PROPERTIES AND AFFILIATE SITES IN TRANSITIONED MARKETS. WE REPORT THE NET REVENUE WE RECEIVE UNDER THE SEARCH AGREEMENT AS REVENUE AND NO LONGER PRESENT THE ASSOCIATED TAC. ACCORDINGLY, FOR TRANSITIONED MARKETS WE\nREPORT GAAP REVENUE ASSOCIATED WITH THE SEARCH AGREEMENT ON A NET (AFTER TAC) BASIS RATHER THAN A GROSS BASIS. FOR MARKETS THAT HAVE NOT YET TRANSITIONED, REVENUE CONTINUES TO BE RECORDED ON A GROSS BASIS, AND TAC IS RECORDED AS A PART OF\nOPERATING EXPENSES.\nWE PRESENT REVENUE EX-TAC TO PROVIDE INVESTORS A METRIC USED BY US FOR EVALUATION AND DECISION-MAKING PURPOSES DURING THE\nMICROSOFT TRANSITION AND TO PROVIDE INVESTORS WITH COMPARABLE REVENUE NUMBERS WHEN COMPARING PERIODS PRECEDING, DURING AND FOLLOWING THE TRANSITION PERIOD. A LIMITATION OF REVENUE EX-TAC IS THAT IT IS A MEASURE WHICH WE HAVE DEFINED FOR INTERNAL AND\nINVESTOR PURPOSES THAT MAY BE UNIQUE TO US, AND THEREFORE IT MAY NOT ENHANCE THE COMPARABILITY OF OUR RESULTS TO OTHER COMPANIES IN OUR INDUSTRY WHO HAVE SIMILAR BUSINESS ARRANGEMENTS BUT ADDRESS THE IMPACT OF TAC DIFFERENTLY. MANAGEMENT COMPENSATES\nFOR THESE LIMITATIONS BY ALSO RELYING ON THE COMPARABLE GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES OF REVENUE AND TOTAL OPERATING EXPENSES, WHICH INCLUDE TAC IN NON-TRANSITIONED MARKETS.\n36\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nADJUSTED EBITDA\n. ADJUSTED EBITDA IS A NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURE DEFINED AS NET INCOME ATTRIBUTABLE\nTO YAHOO! INC. BEFORE TAXES, DEPRECIATION, AMORTIZATION OF INTANGIBLE ASSETS, STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION EXPENSE, OTHER INCOME, NET (WHICH INCLUDES INTEREST), EARNINGS IN EQUITY INTERESTS, NET INCOME ATTRIBUTABLE TO NONCONTROLLING INTERESTS AND\nCERTAIN GAINS, LOSSES, AND EXPENSES THAT WE DO NOT BELIEVE ARE INDICATIVE OF OUR ONGOING RESULTS.\nWE PRESENT ADJUSTED EBITDA BECAUSE THE\nEXCLUSION OF CERTAIN GAINS, LOSSES, AND EXPENSES FACILITATES COMPARISONS OF THE OPERATING PERFORMANCE OF OUR COMPANY ON A PERIOD TO PERIOD BASIS. ADJUSTED EBITDA HAS LIMITATIONS AS AN ANALYTICAL TOOL AND SHOULD NOT BE CONSIDERED IN ISOLATION OR AS A\nSUBSTITUTE FOR RESULTS REPORTED UNDER GAAP. THESE LIMITATIONS INCLUDE: ADJUSTED EBITDA DOES NOT REFLECT TAX PAYMENTS AND SUCH PAYMENTS REFLECT A REDUCTION IN CASH AVAILABLE TO US; ADJUSTED EBITDA DOES NOT REFLECT THE PERIODIC COSTS OF CERTAIN\nCAPITALIZED TANGIBLE AND INTANGIBLE ASSETS USED IN GENERATING REVENUES IN OUR BUSINESSES; ADJUSTED EBITDA DOES NOT INCLUDE STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION EXPENSE RELATED TO OUR WORKFORCE; ADJUSTED EBITDA ALSO EXCLUDES OTHER INCOME, NET (WHICH INCLUDES\nINTEREST), EARNINGS IN EQUITY INTERESTS, NET INCOME ATTRIBUTABLE TO NONCONTROLLING INTERESTS AND CERTAIN GAINS, LOSSES, AND EXPENSES THAT WE DO NOT BELIEVE ARE INDICATIVE OF OUR ONGOING RESULTS, AND THESE ITEMS MAY REPRESENT A REDUCTION OR INCREASE\nIN CASH AVAILABLE TO US. ADJUSTED EBITDA IS A MEASURE THAT MAY BE UNIQUE TO US, AND THEREFORE IT MAY NOT ENHANCE THE COMPARABILITY OF OUR RESULTS TO OTHER COMPANIES IN OUR INDUSTRY.

FREE CASH FLOW IS A NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURE DEFINED AS NET CASH PROVIDED BY (USED IN) OPERATING ACTIVITIES (ADJUSTED TO INCLUDE EXCESS TAX BENEFITS FROM STOCK-BASED AWARDS), LESS ACQUISITION OF PROPERTY AND EQUIPMENT, NET AND DIVIDENDS\nRECEIVED FROM EQUITY INVESTEES.\nWE CONSIDER FREE CASH FLOW TO BE A LIQUIDITY MEASURE WHICH PROVIDES USEFUL INFORMATION TO MANAGEMENT AND\nINVESTORS ABOUT THE AMOUNT OF CASH GENERATED BY THE BUSINESS AFTER THE ACQUISITION OF PROPERTY AND EQUIPMENT, WHICH CAN THEN BE USED FOR STRATEGIC OPPORTUNITIES INCLUDING, AMONG OTHERS, INVESTING IN OUR BUSINESS, MAKING STRATEGIC ACQUISITIONS,\nSTRENGTHENING THE BALANCE SHEET, AND REPURCHASING STOCK. A LIMITATION OF FREE CASH FLOW IS THAT IT DOES NOT REPRESENT THE TOTAL INCREASE OR DECREASE IN THE CASH BALANCE FOR THE PERIOD. MANAGEMENT COMPENSATES FOR THE LIMITATION OF FREE CASH FLOW BY\nALSO RELYING ON THE NET CHANGE IN CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS AS PRESENTED IN OUR CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF CASH FLOWS PREPARED IN ACCORDANCE WITH GAAP WHICH INCORPORATES ALL CASH MOVEMENTS DURING THE PERIOD.\nSIGNIFICANT TRANSACTIONS\nINITIAL\nREPURCHASE OF ALIBABA GROUP HOLDING LIMITED ORDINARY SHARES\nON SEPTEMBER 18, 2012 (THE \u0093REPURCHASE CLOSING DATE\u0094),\nALIBABA GROUP HOLDING LIMITED (\u0093ALIBABA GROUP\u0094) REPURCHASED (THE \u0093INITIAL REPURCHASE\u0094) 523 MILLION OF THE 1,047 MILLION ORDINARY SHARES OF ALIBABA GROUP (\u0093SHARES\u0094) OWNED BY US.

THE BENEFIT IS\nPRIMARILY DUE TO EXCESS FOREIGN TAX CREDITS. OF THE $117 MILLION, $102 MILLION IS INCLUDED ABOVE WITHIN \u0093EFFECT OF NON-U.S. OPERATIONS.\u0094\n\u0095\nSTATE TAXES WERE HIGHER IN 2010 DUE TO A REDUCTION OF DEFERRED TAX ASSETS ASSOCIATED WITH AN EFFECTIVE TAX RATE REDUCTION IN CALIFORNIA THAT STARTED IN\n2011.\n\u0095\nIN 2010, WE HAD A FAVORABLE RESOLUTION OF CERTAIN ISSUES IN AN IRS EXAMINATION OF OUR 2005 AND 2006 U.S. FEDERAL INCOME TAX RETURNS RESULTING IN A\nREDUCTION OF RESERVES FOR TAX UNCERTAINTIES AND THE AVAILABILITY OF CAPITAL LOSS CARRYFORWARDS TO OFFSET THE TAX ON THE GAIN FROM THE SALES OF ZIMBRA, INC. AND HOTJOBS.\n\u0095\nDURING 2010, IN CONNECTION WITH TAX RESTRUCTURING ACTIVITIES, WE REACHED A FORMAL AGREEMENT WITH THE IRS THROUGH A PRE-FILING AGREEMENT TO TREAT\nCERTAIN INTERCOMPANY BAD DEBTS AS DEDUCTIBLE BUSINESS EXPENSES ON THE 2009 FEDERAL INCOME TAX RETURN.\n50\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nDURING THE FOURTH QUARTER OF 2011, WE COMMENCED DISCUSSIONS WITH THE IRS APPEALS DIVISION TO SETTLE THE\nCONTESTED ADJUSTMENTS FOR CERTAIN INTERCOMPANY TRANSFER-PRICING MATTERS FROM THE 2005 AND 2006 INCOME TAX EXAMINATION. A TENTATIVE AGREEMENT HAS BEEN REACHED AND IF THE MATTER IS RESOLVED ON THE BASIS THAT IS CURRENTLY BEING DISCUSSED WITH THE IRS,\nTHEN THE SETTLEMENT WILL NOT CAUSE US TO HAVE TAX EXPOSURE BEYOND WHAT HAS ALREADY BEEN PROVIDED. WE HAVE PROTESTED SIMILAR TRANSFER-PRICING ADJUSTMENTS TO OUR 2007 AND 2008 INCOME TAX RETURNS. NO HEARINGS WITH THE IRS APPEALS DIVISION HAVE BEEN\nHELD. OUR 2009 AND 2010 U.S. INCOME TAX RETURNS ARE CURRENTLY UNDER IRS EXAMINATION.\nAS OF DECEMBER 31, 2012, OUR 2005 THROUGH 2008 TAX\nRETURNS ARE ALSO UNDER VARIOUS STAGES OF AUDIT BY THE CALIFORNIA FRANCHISE TAX BOARD. WHILE THE FRANCHISE TAX BOARD HAS NOT REACHED ANY CONCLUSIONS ON THE 2007 AND 2008 RETURNS, WE HAVE PROTESTED THE PROPOSED ADJUSTMENTS TO THE 2005 AND 2006\nRETURNS. WE ARE ALSO IN VARIOUS STAGES OF EXAMINATION AND APPEAL IN CONNECTION WITH OUR TAXES IN FOREIGN JURISDICTIONS, WHICH GENERALLY SPAN TAX YEARS 2005 THROUGH 2010.\nWHILE IT IS DIFFICULT TO DETERMINE WHEN THESE EXAMINATIONS WILL BE SETTLED OR WHAT THEIR FINAL OUTCOMES WILL BE, CERTAIN AUDITS IN VARIOUS JURISDICTIONS RELATED TO MULTINATIONAL INCOME TAX ISSUES ARE\nEXPECTED TO BE RESOLVED IN THE FORESEEABLE FUTURE. AS A RESULT, IT IS REASONABLY POSSIBLE THAT THE UNRECOGNIZED TAX BENEFITS COULD BE REDUCED BY UP TO APPROXIMATELY $90 MILLION IN THE NEXT TWELVE MONTHS. WE BELIEVE THAT WE HAVE ADEQUATELY PROVIDED\nFOR ANY REASONABLY FORESEEABLE ADJUSTMENT AND THAT ANY SETTLEMENT WILL NOT HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL POSITION, RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, OR CASH FLOWS. OUR GROSS AMOUNT OF UNRECOGNIZED TAX BENEFITS AS OF\nDECEMBER 31, 2012 IS $727 MILLION, OF WHICH $644 MILLION IS RECORDED ON THE CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS.\nTHE FEDERAL RESEARCH AND\nDEVELOPMENT CREDIT EXPIRED ON DECEMBER 31, 2011. ON JANUARY 2, 2013, THE AMERICAN TAXPAYER RELIEF ACT OF 2012 WAS SIGNED INTO LAW. UNDER THIS ACT, THE FEDERAL RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT CREDIT WAS RETROACTIVELY EXTENDED FOR AMOUNTS PAID OR\nINCURRED AFTER DECEMBER 31, 2011 AND BEFORE JANUARY 1, 2014. THE EFFECTS OF THESE CHANGES IN THE TAX LAW WILL RESULT IN A TAX BENEFIT WHICH WILL BE RECOGNIZED IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2013, WHICH IS THE QUARTER IN WHICH THE LAW WAS ENACTED.\nWE MAY HAVE ADDITIONAL TAX LIABILITIES IN CHINA RELATED TO THE SALE TO ALIBABA GROUP OF 523 MILLION ORDINARY SHARES OF ALIBABA GROUP\nTHAT TOOK PLACE DURING THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2012. ANY TAXES ASSESSED AND PAID IN CHINA ARE EXPECTED TO BE ULTIMATELY OFFSET AND RECOVERED IN THE U.S.\nDURING THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2012, TAX AUTHORITIES FROM THE BRAZILIAN STATE OF SAO PAULO ASSESSED CERTAIN INDIRECT TAXES AGAINST OUR BRAZILIAN SUBSIDIARY, YAHOO!

THE INCREASE WAS DUE TO CASH PROCEEDS, NET OF FEES, OF $6.2 BILLION RECEIVED FROM THE SALE OF ALIBABA GROUP SHARES AND $550 MILLION FROM THE TIPLA PAYMENT. THIS WAS PARTIALLY OFFSET BY THE REPURCHASE OF APPROXIMATELY\n126 MILLION SHARES OF OUR OUTSTANDING COMMON STOCK FOR $2.2 BILLION DURING THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2012 AND CASH TAXES PAID OF $2.3 BILLION IN 2012 RELATED TO THE SALE OF ALIBABA GROUP SHARES. AFTER THE PAYMENT OF TAXES AND FEES, NET\nCASH PROCEEDS FROM THE INITIAL REPURCHASE AND THE $550 MILLION TIPLA PAYMENT WERE APPROXIMATELY $4.3 BILLION. WE INTEND TO RETURN $3.65 BILLION OF THE AFTER-TAX PROCEEDS TO SHAREHOLDERS. WE HAVE RETURNED APPROXIMATELY $2.1 BILLION TO SHAREHOLDERS\nTHROUGH SHARE REPURCHASES FROM MAY 20, 2012, THE DATE WE ANNOUNCED THE REPURCHASE AGREEMENT, THROUGH DECEMBER 31, 2012.\nAS OF\nDECEMBER 31, 2011, WE HAD CASH, CASH EQUIVALENTS, AND MARKETABLE DEBT SECURITIES TOTALING $2.5 BILLION, COMPARED TO $3.6 BILLION AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2010. THIS WAS DUE PRIMARILY TO THE REPURCHASE OF APPROXIMATELY 110 MILLION SHARES OF\nOUR OUTSTANDING COMMON STOCK FOR $1.6 BILLION DURING THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2011.\nOUR FOREIGN SUBSIDIARIES HELD $567 MILLION OF OUR\nTOTAL $6.0 BILLION OF CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS AND MARKETABLE DEBT SECURITIES AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2012. DURING THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2012, WE RECORDED THE TAX EFFECT OF A ONE-TIME DISTRIBUTION OF EARNINGS FROM CERTAIN FOREIGN\nSUBSIDIARIES. WE MADE A ONE-TIME REPATRIATION OF FOREIGN EARNINGS AND RETURN OF BASIS OF FOREIGN SUBSIDIARIES OF $962 MILLION FROM CERTAIN OF OUR CONSOLIDATED FOREIGN SUBSIDIARIES IN 2012. AFTER THIS DISTRIBUTION, CUMULATIVE EARNINGS REMAINING\nIN OUR CONSOLIDATED FOREIGN SUBSIDIARIES AND THE RELATED POTENTIAL TAX EFFECT OF REPATRIATION IS NOT MATERIAL TO OUR CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.\n52\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nON OCTOBER 19, 2012, WE ENTERED INTO A CREDIT AGREEMENT (THE \u0093CREDIT AGREEMENT\u0094) WITH\nCITIBANK, N.A., AS ADMINISTRATIVE AGENT, AND THE OTHER LENDERS PARTY THERETO FROM TIME TO TIME. THE CREDIT AGREEMENT PROVIDES FOR A $750 MILLION UNSECURED REVOLVING CREDIT FACILITY FOR A TERM OF 364 DAYS, SUBJECT TO EXTENSION FOR ADDITIONAL 364-DAY\nPERIODS IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE TERMS AND CONDITIONS OF THE CREDIT AGREEMENT. WE MAY ELECT TO INCREASE THE REVOLVING CREDIT FACILITY BY UP TO $250 MILLION IF EXISTING OR NEW LENDERS PROVIDE ADDITIONAL REVOLVING COMMITMENTS IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE\nTERMS OF THE CREDIT AGREEMENT. THE PROCEEDS FROM BORROWINGS UNDER THE CREDIT AGREEMENT, IF ANY, ARE EXPECTED TO BE USED FOR GENERAL CORPORATE PURPOSES. BORROWINGS UNDER THE CREDIT AGREEMENT WILL BEAR INTEREST AT A RATE EQUAL TO, AT OUR OPTION,\nEITHER (A) A CUSTOMARY LONDON INTERBANK OFFERED RATE (A \u0093EURODOLLAR RATE\u0094), OR (B) A CUSTOMARY BASE RATE (A \u0093BASE RATE\u0094), IN EACH CASE PLUS AN APPLICABLE MARGIN. THE APPLICABLE MARGIN FOR BORROWINGS UNDER THE CREDIT\nAGREEMENT WILL BE BASED UPON THE LEVERAGE RATIO OF THE COMPANY AND RANGE FROM 1.25 PERCENT TO 1.50 PERCENT WITH RESPECT TO EURODOLLAR RATE BORROWINGS AND 0.25 PERCENT TO 0.50 PERCENT WITH RESPECT TO BASE RATE BORROWINGS. AS OF DECEMBER 31,\n2012, WE WERE IN COMPLIANCE WITH THE FINANCIAL COVENANTS IN THE CREDIT FACILITY AND NO AMOUNTS WERE OUTSTANDING.\nWE INVEST EXCESS CASH\nPREDOMINANTLY IN MARKETABLE DEBT SECURITIES, MONEY MARKET FUNDS, AND TIME DEPOSITS THAT ARE LIQUID, HIGHLY RATED, AND THE MAJORITY OF WHICH HAVE EFFECTIVE MATURITIES OF LESS THAN ONE YEAR. OUR MARKETABLE DEBT AND EQUITY SECURITIES ARE CLASSIFIED AS\nAVAILABLE-FOR-SALE AND ARE REPORTED AT FAIR VALUE, WITH UNREALIZED GAINS AND LOSSES, NET OF TAX, RECORDED IN ACCUMULATED OTHER COMPREHENSIVE INCOME. REALIZED GAINS OR LOSSES AND DECLINES IN VALUE JUDGED TO BE OTHER-THAN-TEMPORARY, IF ANY, ON\nAVAILABLE-FOR-SALE SECURITIES ARE REPORTED IN OTHER INCOME, NET. THE FAIR VALUE FOR SECURITIES IS DETERMINED BASED ON QUOTED MARKET PRICES OF THE HISTORICAL UNDERLYING SECURITY OR FROM READILY AVAILABLE PRICING SOURCES FOR THE IDENTICAL UNDERLYING\nSECURITIES THAT MAY NOT BE ACTIVELY TRADED AS OF THE VALUATION DATE. AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2012, CERTAIN OF OUR MARKETABLE DEBT SECURITIES HAD A FAIR VALUE BELOW COST DUE PRIMARILY TO THE CHANGES IN MARKET RATES OF INTEREST AND YIELDS ON THESE\nSECURITIES. WE EVALUATE THESE INVESTMENTS PERIODICALLY FOR POSSIBLE OTHER-THAN-TEMPORARY IMPAIRMENT. WE HAVE NO CURRENT REQUIREMENT OR INTENT TO SELL THESE SECURITIES. WE EXPECT TO RECOVER UP TO (OR BEYOND) THE INITIAL COST OF THE INVESTMENT.\nWE MONITOR OUR EXPOSURE TO EUROPEAN MARKETS, AND AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2012 WE DO NOT HAVE ANY MATERIAL DIRECT EXPOSURE TO EUROPEAN\nSOVEREIGN DEBT SECURITIES. WE INVEST A PORTION OF EXCESS OPERATING CASH IN MONEY MARKET FUNDS DENOMINATED IN EUROS AND BRITISH POUNDS, AND THROUGH SOME OF THESE FUNDS WE MAY HAVE IMMATERIAL INDIRECT EXPOSURE TO HIGH-CREDIT QUALITY EUROPEAN SOVEREIGN\nDEBT SECURITIES.\nWE CURRENTLY HEDGE OUR NET INVESTMENT IN YAHOO JAPAN WITH FORWARD CONTRACTS TO REDUCE THE RISK THAT OUR INVESTMENT IN YAHOO\nJAPAN WILL BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED BY FOREIGN CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATE FLUCTUATIONS. THE FORWARD CONTRACTS ARE REQUIRED TO BE SETTLED IN CASH AND THE AMOUNT OF CASH PAYMENT WE RECEIVE OR COULD BE REQUIRED TO PAY UPON SETTLEMENT COULD BE MATERIAL.\nWE EXPECT TO CONTINUE TO EVALUATE POSSIBLE ACQUISITIONS OF, OR STRATEGIC INVESTMENTS IN, BUSINESSES, PRODUCTS, AND TECHNOLOGIES THAT ARE\nCOMPLEMENTARY TO OUR BUSINESS, WHICH ACQUISITIONS AND INVESTMENTS MAY REQUIRE THE USE OF CASH.\nWE EXPECT TO GENERATE POSITIVE CASH FLOWS FROM\nOPERATIONS IN 2013. WE USE CASH GENERATED BY OPERATIONS AS OUR PRIMARY SOURCE OF LIQUIDITY, SINCE WE BELIEVE THAT INTERNALLY GENERATED CASH FLOWS ARE SUFFICIENT TO SUPPORT OUR BUSINESS OPERATIONS AND CAPITAL EXPENDITURES. WE BELIEVE THAT EXISTING\nCASH, CASH EQUIVALENTS, AND INVESTMENTS IN MARKETABLE DEBT SECURITIES, TOGETHER WITH ANY CASH GENERATED FROM OPERATIONS AND BORROWINGS UNDER THE CREDIT AGREEMENT, WILL BE SUFFICIENT TO MEET NORMAL OPERATING REQUIREMENTS INCLUDING CAPITAL\nEXPENDITURES FOR THE NEXT TWELVE MONTHS.\nSEE NOTE 2\u0097\u0093INVESTMENTS AND FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS\u0094 IN THE NOTES TO OUR\nCONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR ADDITIONAL INFORMATION.\n53\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nCASH FLOW CHANGES\nCASH PROVIDED BY OPERATING ACTIVITIES IS DRIVEN BY OUR NET INCOME, ADJUSTED FOR NON-CASH ITEMS, WORKING CAPITAL CHANGES AND DIVIDENDS RECEIVED FROM EQUITY INVESTEES. NON-CASH ADJUSTMENTS INCLUDE\nDEPRECIATION, AMORTIZATION OF INTANGIBLE ASSETS, STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION EXPENSE, NON-CASH RESTRUCTURING CHARGES, TAX BENEFITS FROM STOCK-BASED AWARDS, EXCESS TAX BENEFITS FROM STOCK-BASED AWARDS, DEFERRED INCOME TAXES, AND EARNINGS IN EQUITY\nINTERESTS. WE HAD A NET USE OF CASH IN THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2012 PRIMARILY DUE TO A CASH TAX PAYMENT OF $2.3 BILLION RELATED TO THE SALE OF ALIBABA GROUP SHARES. OFFSETTING THIS USE, WE GENERATED ADJUSTED EBITDA OF $1.7 BILLION, RECEIVED A\nPAYMENT FROM ALIBABA GROUP OF $550 MILLION IN SATISFACTION OF CERTAIN FUTURE ROYALTY PAYMENTS, AND RECEIVED DIVIDENDS FROM YAHOO JAPAN OF $84 MILLION. CASH PROVIDED BY OPERATING ACTIVITIES WAS HIGHER THAN NET INCOME IN THE YEAR ENDED\nDECEMBER 31, 2011 MAINLY DUE TO NON-CASH ITEMS INCLUDED IN NET INCOME. CASH PROVIDED BY OPERATING ACTIVITIES WAS SLIGHTLY LOWER THAN NET INCOME IN THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2010 DUE TO NON-CASH ITEMS INCLUDED IN NET INCOME AND CHANGES IN\nWORKING CAPITAL, INCLUDING LOWER COLLECTIONS ON ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE, HIGHER TAX PAYMENTS, AND MICROSOFT REIMBURSEMENTS NOT YET RECEIVED AS CASH.\nCASH PROVIDED BY INVESTING ACTIVITIES IS PRIMARILY ATTRIBUTABLE TO CAPITAL EXPENDITURES, PURCHASES, SALES AND MATURITIES OF MARKETABLE DEBT SECURITIES, PURCHASES OF INTANGIBLE ASSETS, SALES OF OTHER\nASSETS, AS WELL AS ACQUISITIONS INCLUDING OUR STRATEGIC INVESTMENTS. OUR CAPITAL EXPENDITURES, INCLUDING CAPITALIZED SOFTWARE AND LABOR, TOTALED $506 MILLION IN 2012, $593 MILLION IN 2011, AND $714 MILLION IN 2010. OUR CAPITAL EXPENDITURES HAVE BEEN\nPRIMARILY USED FOR PURCHASES AND INTERNAL DEVELOPMENT OF SOFTWARE TO SUPPORT OUR OFFERINGS AND OUR INCREASED NUMBER OF USERS AS WELL AS THE BUILD OUT OF OUR OWNED AND OPERATED DATA CENTERS. DURING THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2012, WE UTILIZED\nAPPROXIMATELY $2.4 BILLION FOR NET PURCHASES OF MARKETABLE DEBT SECURITIES WHICH WAS OFFSET BY CASH PROCEEDS, NET OF FEES, OF $6.2 BILLION RECEIVED FROM THE SALE OF OUR SHARES TO ALIBABA GROUP. IN EACH OF 2011 AND 2010, WE RECEIVED NET PROCEEDS FROM\nSALES, MATURITIES, AND PURCHASES OF MARKETABLE DEBT SECURITIES OF $1.1 BILLION. IN 2010, WE RECEIVED NET PROCEEDS OF $325 MILLION FROM SALES OF DIVESTED BUSINESSES FOR WHICH THERE WERE NO SIMILAR TRANSACTIONS IN 2011. WE INVESTED A NET $6.0 MILLION\nIN ACQUISITIONS IN 2012, COMPARED TO $324 MILLION AND $157 MILLION IN 2011 AND 2010, RESPECTIVELY. ACQUISITION INVESTMENTS IN 2011 INCLUDED THE CASH OUTLAY FOR AN ACQUISITION IN THE AMERICAS REGION.\nCASH USED IN FINANCING ACTIVITIES IS DRIVEN BY STOCK REPURCHASES OFFSET BY EMPLOYEE STOCK OPTION EXERCISES AND EMPLOYEE STOCK PURCHASES. OUR CASH\nPROCEEDS FROM EMPLOYEE OPTION EXERCISES AND EMPLOYEE STOCK PURCHASES MADE THROUGH OUR EMPLOYEE STOCK PURCHASE PLAN WERE $218 MILLION IN 2012, COMPARED TO $156 MILLION AND $167 MILLION IN 2011 AND 2010, RESPECTIVELY. DURING THE YEAR ENDED\nDECEMBER 31, 2012, WE USED APPROXIMATELY $2.2 BILLION IN THE DIRECT REPURCHASE OF 126 MILLION SHARES OF COMMON STOCK AT AN AVERAGE PRICE OF $17.20 PER SHARE AND $61 MILLION FOR TAX WITHHOLDING PAYMENTS RELATED TO NET SHARE SETTLEMENTS\nOF RESTRICTED STOCK UNITS. DURING THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2011, WE USED APPROXIMATELY $1.6 BILLION IN THE DIRECT REPURCHASE OF 110 MILLION SHARES OF COMMON STOCK AT AN AVERAGE PRICE OF $14.75 PER SHARE AND $45 MILLION FOR TAX\nWITHHOLDING PAYMENTS RELATED TO NET SHARE SETTLEMENTS OF RESTRICTED STOCK UNITS. DURING THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2010, WE USED APPROXIMATELY $1.7 BILLION IN THE DIRECT REPURCHASE OF 119 MILLION SHARES OF COMMON STOCK AT AN AVERAGE PRICE\nOF $14.68 PER SHARE AND $49 MILLION FOR TAX WITHHOLDING PAYMENTS RELATED TO NET SHARE SETTLEMENTS OF RESTRICTED STOCK UNITS AND TAX WITHHOLDING-RELATED REACQUISITION OF SHARES OF RESTRICTED STOCK. IN 2012, 2011, AND 2010, $36 MILLION, $71\nMILLION, AND $131 MILLION, RESPECTIVELY, OF EXCESS TAX BENEFITS FROM STOCK-BASED AWARDS FOR OPTIONS EXERCISED IN CURRENT AND PRIOR PERIODS WERE INCLUDED AS A SOURCE OF CASH FLOWS FROM FINANCING ACTIVITIES. THESE EXCESS TAX BENEFITS REPRESENT THE\nREDUCTION IN INCOME TAXES OTHERWISE PAYABLE DURING THE PERIOD, ATTRIBUTABLE TO THE ACTUAL GROSS TAX BENEFITS IN EXCESS OF THE EXPECTED TAX BENEFITS FOR OPTIONS EXERCISED IN CURRENT AND PRIOR PERIODS. WE HAVE ACCUMULATED EXCESS TAX DEDUCTIONS\nRELATING TO STOCK OPTIONS EXERCISED PRIOR TO JANUARY 1, 2006 AVAILABLE TO REDUCE INCOME TAXES OTHERWISE PAYABLE. TO THE EXTENT SUCH DEDUCTIONS REDUCE INCOME TAXES PAYABLE IN THE CURRENT YEAR, THEY ARE REPORTED AS FINANCING ACTIVITIES IN THE\nCONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF CASH FLOWS.

SEE NOTE 15\u0097\u0093INCOME TAXES\u0094 IN THE NOTES TO OUR CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR ADDITIONAL INFORMATION.\nINTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS.\nWE ARE COMMITTED TO MAKE CERTAIN PAYMENTS UNDER VARIOUS INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY\nARRANGEMENTS OF UP TO $31 MILLION THROUGH 2023.\nOTHER COMMITMENTS.\nIN THE ORDINARY COURSE OF BUSINESS, WE MAY PROVIDE INDEMNIFICATIONS\nOF VARYING SCOPE AND TERMS TO CUSTOMERS, VENDORS, LESSORS, JOINT VENTURES AND BUSINESS PARTNERS, PURCHASERS OF ASSETS OR SUBSIDIARIES AND OTHER PARTIES WITH RESPECT TO CERTAIN MATTERS, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, LOSSES ARISING OUT OF THE OUR\nBREACH OF AGREEMENTS OR REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES MADE BY US, SERVICES TO BE PROVIDED BY US, INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY INFRINGEMENT CLAIMS MADE BY THIRD PARTIES OR, WITH RESPECT TO THE SALE OF ASSETS OR A SUBSIDIARY, MATTERS RELATED TO OUR CONDUCT\nOF THE BUSINESS AND TAX MATTERS PRIOR TO THE SALE. IN ADDITION, WE HAVE ENTERED INTO INDEMNIFICATION AGREEMENTS WITH OUR DIRECTORS AND CERTAIN OF OUR OFFICERS THAT WILL REQUIRE US, AMONG OTHER THINGS, TO INDEMNIFY THEM AGAINST CERTAIN\nLIABILITIES THAT MAY ARISE BY REASON OF THEIR STATUS OR SERVICE AS DIRECTORS OR OFFICERS. WE HAVE ALSO AGREED TO INDEMNIFY CERTAIN FORMER OFFICERS, DIRECTORS, AND EMPLOYEES OF ACQUIRED COMPANIES IN CONNECTION WITH THE ACQUISITION OF SUCH COMPANIES.\nWE MAINTAIN DIRECTOR AND OFFICER INSURANCE, WHICH MAY COVER CERTAIN LIABILITIES ARISING FROM ITS OBLIGATION TO INDEMNIFY OUR DIRECTORS AND OFFICERS, AND FORMER DIRECTORS AND OFFICERS OF ACQUIRED COMPANIES, IN CERTAIN CIRCUMSTANCES. IT IS NOT\nPOSSIBLE TO DETERMINE THE AGGREGATE MAXIMUM POTENTIAL LOSS UNDER THESE INDEMNIFICATION AGREEMENTS DUE TO THE LIMITED HISTORY OF PRIOR INDEMNIFICATION CLAIMS AND THE UNIQUE FACTS AND CIRCUMSTANCES INVOLVED IN EACH PARTICULAR AGREEMENT. SUCH\nINDEMNIFICATION AGREEMENTS MIGHT NOT BE SUBJECT TO MAXIMUM LOSS CLAUSES. HISTORICALLY, WE HAVE NOT INCURRED MATERIAL COSTS AS A RESULT OF OBLIGATIONS UNDER THESE AGREEMENTS AND IT HAS NOT ACCRUED ANY LIABILITIES RELATED TO SUCH INDEMNIFICATION\nOBLIGATIONS IN OUR CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.\nOFF BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS\nAS OF DECEMBER 31, 2012, WE DID NOT HAVE ANY RELATIONSHIPS WITH UNCONSOLIDATED ENTITIES OR FINANCIAL PARTNERSHIPS, SUCH AS ENTITIES OFTEN REFERRED TO\nAS STRUCTURED FINANCE OR SPECIAL PURPOSE ENTITIES, WHICH WOULD HAVE BEEN ESTABLISHED FOR THE PURPOSE OF FACILITATING OFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS OR OTHER CONTRACTUALLY NARROW OR LIMITED PURPOSES. ACCORDINGLY WE ARE NOT EXPOSED TO ANY FINANCING,\nLIQUIDITY, MARKET, OR CREDIT RISK THAT COULD ARISE IF WE HAD ENGAGED IN SUCH RELATIONSHIPS. IN ADDITION, WE IDENTIFIED NO VARIABLE INTERESTS CURRENTLY HELD IN ENTITIES FOR WHICH WE ARE THE PRIMARY BENEFICIARY. IN ADDITION, AS OF DECEMBER 31,\n2012, WE HAD NO OFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS THAT HAVE, OR ARE REASONABLY LIKELY TO HAVE, A CURRENT OR FUTURE MATERIAL EFFECT ON OUR CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL CONDITION, RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, LIQUIDITY, CAPITAL EXPENDITURES OR CAPITAL RESOURCES.\nCRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES\nOUR DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF OUR FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS IS BASED UPON OUR CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS, WHICH HAVE BEEN PREPARED IN ACCORDANCE WITH U.S. GAAP. THE PREPARATION\nOF THESE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS REQUIRES US TO MAKE ESTIMATES, JUDGMENTS, AND ASSUMPTIONS THAT AFFECT THE REPORTED AMOUNTS OF ASSETS, LIABILITIES, REVENUE AND EXPENSES, AND THE RELATED DISCLOSURE OF CONTINGENT ASSETS AND\n56\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nLIABILITIES. WE BASE OUR ESTIMATES ON HISTORICAL EXPERIENCE AND ON VARIOUS OTHER ASSUMPTIONS THAT WE BELIEVE ARE REASONABLE UNDER THE CIRCUMSTANCES, THE RESULTS OF WHICH FORM THE BASIS FOR MAKING\nJUDGMENTS ABOUT, AMONG OTHER THINGS, THE CARRYING VALUES OF ASSETS AND LIABILITIES THAT ARE NOT READILY APPARENT FROM OTHER SOURCES. ACTUAL RESULTS MAY DIFFER FROM THESE ESTIMATES.\nAN ACCOUNTING POLICY IS CONSIDERED TO BE CRITICAL IF IT REQUIRES AN ACCOUNTING ESTIMATE TO BE MADE BASED ON ASSUMPTIONS ABOUT MATTERS THAT ARE HIGHLY UNCERTAIN AT THE TIME THE ESTIMATE IS MADE, AND IF\nDIFFERENT ESTIMATES THAT REASONABLY COULD HAVE BEEN USED, OR CHANGES IN THE ACCOUNTING ESTIMATE THAT ARE REASONABLY LIKELY TO OCCUR, COULD MATERIALLY IMPACT THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS. WE BELIEVE THAT THE FOLLOWING CRITICAL ACCOUNTING\nPOLICIES REFLECT THE MORE SIGNIFICANT ESTIMATES AND ASSUMPTIONS USED IN THE PREPARATION OF OUR CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.\nMANAGEMENT\nHAS DISCUSSED THE DEVELOPMENT AND SELECTION OF THESE CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES WITH THE AUDIT COMMITTEE OF OUR BOARD, AND THE AUDIT COMMITTEE HAS REVIEWED THE DISCLOSURE BELOW. IN ADDITION, THERE ARE OTHER ITEMS WITHIN OUR FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nTHAT REQUIRE ESTIMATION, BUT ARE NOT DEEMED CRITICAL AS DEFINED ABOVE. CHANGES IN ESTIMATES USED IN THESE AND OTHER ITEMS COULD HAVE A MATERIAL IMPACT ON OUR CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.\nREVENUE RECOGNITION.\nOUR REVENUE IS GENERATED FROM DISPLAY, SEARCH, AND OTHER. DISPLAY REVENUE IS GENERATED FROM THE DISPLAY OF GRAPHICAL\nADVERTISEMENTS AND SEARCH REVENUE IS GENERATED FROM THE DISPLAY OF TEXT-BASED LINKS TO AN ADVERTISER\u0092S WEBSITE AND FROM REVENUE SHARING ARRANGEMENTS WITH PARTNERS FOR SEARCH TECHNOLOGY AND SERVICES. OTHER REVENUE CONSISTS OF LISTINGS-BASED\nSERVICES REVENUE, TRANSACTION REVENUE, AND FEES REVENUE. WHILE THE MAJORITY OF OUR REVENUE TRANSACTIONS CONTAIN STANDARD BUSINESS TERMS AND CONDITIONS, THERE ARE CERTAIN TRANSACTIONS THAT CONTAIN NON-STANDARD BUSINESS TERMS AND CONDITIONS. IN\nADDITION, WE ENTER INTO CERTAIN SALES TRANSACTIONS THAT INVOLVE MULTIPLE ELEMENTS (ARRANGEMENTS WITH MORE THAN ONE DELIVERABLE). WE ALSO ENTER INTO ARRANGEMENTS TO PURCHASE GOODS AND\/OR SERVICES FROM CERTAIN CUSTOMERS. AS A RESULT, SIGNIFICANT\nCONTRACT INTERPRETATION IS SOMETIMES REQUIRED TO DETERMINE THE APPROPRIATE ACCOUNTING FOR THESE TRANSACTIONS INCLUDING: (1) WHETHER AN ARRANGEMENT EXISTS; (2) WHETHER FEES ARE FIXED OR DETERMINABLE; (3) HOW THE ARRANGEMENT\nCONSIDERATION SHOULD BE ALLOCATED AMONG POTENTIAL MULTIPLE ELEMENTS; (4) ESTABLISHING SELLING PRICES FOR DELIVERABLES CONSIDERING MULTIPLE FACTORS; (5) WHEN TO RECOGNIZE REVENUE ON THE DELIVERABLES; (6) WHETHER ALL ELEMENTS OF THE\nARRANGEMENT HAVE BEEN DELIVERED; (7) WHETHER THE ARRANGEMENT SHOULD BE REPORTED GROSS AS A PRINCIPAL VERSUS NET AS AN AGENT; (8) WHETHER WE RECEIVE A SEPARATELY IDENTIFIABLE BENEFIT FROM THE PURCHASE ARRANGEMENTS WITH CERTAIN CUSTOMERS FOR\nWHICH WE CAN REASONABLY ESTIMATE FAIR VALUE; AND (9) WHETHER THE CONSIDERATION RECEIVED FROM A VENDOR SHOULD BE CHARACTERIZED AS REVENUE OR A REIMBURSEMENT OF COSTS INCURRED. IN ADDITION, OUR REVENUE RECOGNITION POLICY REQUIRES AN ASSESSMENT AS\nTO WHETHER COLLECTION IS REASONABLY ASSURED, WHICH INHERENTLY REQUIRES US TO EVALUATE THE CREDITWORTHINESS OF OUR CUSTOMERS. CHANGES IN JUDGMENTS ON THESE ASSUMPTIONS AND ESTIMATES COULD MATERIALLY IMPACT THE TIMING OR AMOUNT OF REVENUE RECOGNITION.\nINCOME TAXES.\nSIGNIFICANT JUDGMENT IS REQUIRED IN EVALUATING OUR UNCERTAIN TAX POSITIONS AND DETERMINING OUR PROVISION FOR INCOME\nTAXES. SEE NOTE 15\u0097\u0093INCOME TAXES\u0094 IN THE NOTES TO OUR CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR ADDITIONAL INFORMATION. WE ESTABLISH RESERVES FOR TAX-RELATED UNCERTAINTIES BASED ON ESTIMATES OF WHETHER, AND THE EXTENT TO WHICH, ADDITIONAL\nTAXES WILL BE DUE. THESE RESERVES ARE ESTABLISHED WHEN WE BELIEVE THAT CERTAIN POSITIONS MIGHT BE CHALLENGED DESPITE OUR BELIEF THAT OUR TAX RETURN POSITIONS ARE IN ACCORDANCE WITH APPLICABLE TAX LAWS. WE ADJUST THESE RESERVES IN LIGHT OF CHANGING\nFACTS AND CIRCUMSTANCES, SUCH AS THE CLOSING OF A TAX AUDIT, NEW TAX LEGISLATION, OR THE CHANGE OF AN ESTIMATE BASED ON NEW INFORMATION. TO THE EXTENT THAT THE FINAL TAX OUTCOME OF THESE MATTERS IS DIFFERENT THAN THE AMOUNTS RECORDED, SUCH\nDIFFERENCES WILL AFFECT THE PROVISION FOR INCOME TAXES IN THE PERIOD IN WHICH SUCH DETERMINATION IS MADE. THE PROVISION FOR INCOME TAXES INCLUDES THE EFFECT OF RESERVE PROVISIONS AND CHANGES TO RESERVES THAT ARE CONSIDERED APPROPRIATE, AS WELL AS\nTHE RELATED NET INTEREST AND PENALTIES.\nWE RECORD A VALUATION ALLOWANCE AGAINST CERTAIN OF OUR DEFERRED INCOME TAX ASSETS IF IT IS MORE\nLIKELY THAN NOT THAT THOSE ASSETS WILL NOT BE REALIZED. IN EVALUATING OUR ABILITY TO REALIZE OUR DEFERRED INCOME TAX ASSETS WE CONSIDER ALL\n57\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nAVAILABLE POSITIVE AND NEGATIVE EVIDENCE, INCLUDING OUR OPERATING RESULTS, ONGOING TAX PLANNING, AND FORECASTS OF FUTURE TAXABLE INCOME ON A JURISDICTION BY JURISDICTION BASIS. IN THE EVENT WE\nWERE TO DETERMINE THAT WE WOULD BE ABLE TO REALIZE THESE DEFERRED INCOME TAX ASSETS IN THE FUTURE, WE WOULD MAKE AN ADJUSTMENT TO THE VALUATION ALLOWANCE, WHICH WOULD REDUCE THE PROVISION FOR INCOME TAXES.\nGOODWILL.\nGOODWILL IS NOT AMORTIZED, BUT IS TESTED FOR IMPAIRMENT ON AN ANNUAL BASIS AND BETWEEN ANNUAL TESTS IN CERTAIN CIRCUMSTANCES. THE\nPERFORMANCE OF THE GOODWILL IMPAIRMENT TEST INVOLVES A TWO-STEP PROCESS. THE FIRST STEP INVOLVES COMPARING THE FAIR VALUE OF OUR REPORTING UNITS TO THEIR CARRYING VALUES, INCLUDING GOODWILL. IF THE CARRYING VALUE OF THE REPORTING UNIT EXCEEDS ITS\nFAIR VALUE, THE SECOND STEP OF THE TEST IS PERFORMED BY COMPARING THE CARRYING VALUE OF THE GOODWILL IN THE REPORTING UNIT TO ITS IMPLIED FAIR VALUE. AN IMPAIRMENT CHARGE IS RECOGNIZED FOR THE EXCESS OF THE CARRYING VALUE OF GOODWILL OVER ITS\nIMPLIED FAIR VALUE.\nOUR REPORTING UNITS ARE BASED ON GEOGRAPHY, EITHER AT THE OPERATING SEGMENT LEVEL OR ONE LEVEL BELOW OPERATING SEGMENTS.\nTHE FAIR VALUES OF OUR REPORTING UNITS ARE ESTIMATED USING AN AVERAGE OF A MARKET APPROACH AND AN INCOME APPROACH AS THIS COMBINATION IS DEEMED TO BE THE MOST INDICATIVE OF OUR FAIR VALUE IN AN ORDERLY TRANSACTION BETWEEN MARKET PARTICIPANTS AND IS\nCONSISTENT WITH THE METHODOLOGY USED FOR THE GOODWILL IMPAIRMENT TEST IN PRIOR YEARS. IN ADDITION, WE ENSURE THAT THE FAIR VALUES ESTIMATED UNDER THESE TWO APPROACHES ARE COMPARABLE WITH EACH OTHER. UNDER THE MARKET APPROACH, WE UTILIZE\nPUBLICLY-TRADED COMPARABLE COMPANY INFORMATION TO DETERMINE REVENUE AND EARNINGS MULTIPLES THAT ARE USED TO VALUE OUR REPORTING UNITS ADJUSTED FOR AN ESTIMATED CONTROL PREMIUM. UNDER THE INCOME APPROACH, WE DETERMINE FAIR VALUE BASED ON ESTIMATED\nFUTURE CASH FLOWS OF EACH REPORTING UNIT DISCOUNTED BY AN ESTIMATED WEIGHTED-AVERAGE COST OF CAPITAL, REFLECTING THE OVERALL LEVEL OF INHERENT RISK OF A REPORTING UNIT AND THE RATE OF RETURN AN OUTSIDE INVESTOR WOULD EXPECT TO EARN. DETERMINING THE\nFAIR VALUE OF A REPORTING UNIT IS JUDGMENTAL IN NATURE AND REQUIRES THE USE OF SIGNIFICANT ESTIMATES AND ASSUMPTIONS, INCLUDING SELECTION OF MARKET COMPARABLES, ESTIMATED FUTURE CASH FLOWS, AND DISCOUNT RATES.\nTHESE COMPONENTS ARE DISCUSSED BELOW.\n\u0095\nMARKET COMPARABLES\nWE SELECT COMPARABLE COMPANIES IN THE SPECIFIC REGIONS IN WHICH OUR REPORTING UNITS OPERATE BASED ON SIMILARITY OF TYPE OF BUSINESS, PRIMARILY THOSE INVOLVED IN ONLINE ADVERTISING, RELATIVE SIZE,\nFINANCIAL PROFILE, AND OTHER CHARACTERISTICS OF THOSE COMPANIES COMPARED TO OUR REPORTING UNITS. TRAILING AND FORWARD REVENUE AND EARNINGS MULTIPLES DERIVED FROM THESE COMPARABLE COMPANIES ARE APPLIED TO FINANCIAL METRICS OF EACH REPORTING UNIT TO\nDETERMINE THEIR ESTIMATED FAIR VALUES, ADJUSTED FOR AN ESTIMATED CONTROL PREMIUM.\n\u0095\nESTIMATED FUTURE CASH FLOWS\nWE BASE CASH FLOW PROJECTIONS FOR EACH REPORTING UNIT USING A FIVE-YEAR FORECAST OF CASH FLOWS AND A TERMINAL VALUE BASED ON THE PERPETUITY GROWTH MODEL. THE FIVE-YEAR FORECAST AND RELATED ASSUMPTIONS\nWERE DERIVED FROM THE MOST RECENT ANNUAL FINANCIAL FORECAST FOR WHICH THE PLANNING PROCESS COMMENCED IN OUR FOURTH QUARTER. KEY ASSUMPTIONS IN ESTIMATING FUTURE CASH FLOWS INCLUDE, AMONG OTHER ITEMS, REVENUE AND OPERATING EXPENSE GROWTH RATES,\nTERMINAL VALUE GROWTH RATE, AND CAPITAL EXPENDITURE AND WORKING CAPITAL LEVELS.\n\u0095\nDISCOUNT RATES\nWE EMPLOY A WEIGHTED AVERAGE COST OF CAPITAL (\u0093WACC\u0094) APPROACH TO DETERMINE THE DISCOUNT RATES USED IN OUR CASH FLOW PROJECTIONS. THE DETERMINATION OF THE DISCOUNT RATES FOR EACH REPORTING UNIT\nINCLUDES FACTORS SUCH AS THE RISK-FREE RATE OF RETURN AND THE RETURN AN OUTSIDE INVESTOR WOULD EXPECT TO EARN BASED ON THE OVERALL LEVEL OF INHERENT RISK. THE DETERMINATION OF EXPECTED RETURNS INCLUDES CONSIDERATION OF THE BETA (A MEASURE OF RISK)\nOF TRADED SECURITIES OF COMPARABLE COMPANIES AND RISK PREMIUMS OF REPORTING UNITS BASED ON INTERNATIONAL COST OF CAPITAL METHODS.\nTHE SUM OF\nTHE FAIR VALUES OF OUR REPORTING UNITS IS RECONCILED TO OUR MARKET CAPITALIZATION AFTER CONSIDERING AN ESTIMATED CONTROL PREMIUM.\n58\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nWE CONDUCTED OUR ANNUAL GOODWILL IMPAIRMENT TEST AS OF OCTOBER 31, 2012 AND DETERMINED THAT THE FAIR\nVALUES OF OUR REPORTING UNITS EXCEEDED THEIR CARRYING VALUES AND THEREFORE GOODWILL IN THOSE REPORTING UNITS WAS NOT IMPAIRED.\nSIGNIFICANT\nMANAGEMENT JUDGMENT IS INVOLVED IN DETERMINING THESE ESTIMATES AND ASSUMPTIONS. CHANGES IN THESE ESTIMATES AND ASSUMPTIONS COULD MATERIALLY AFFECT THE DETERMINATION OF FAIR VALUE FOR EACH REPORTING UNIT WHICH COULD TRIGGER FUTURE IMPAIRMENT.\nLONG-LIVED ASSETS\n. WE AMORTIZE LONG-LIVED ASSETS OVER THEIR ESTIMATED USEFUL LIVES. IDENTIFIABLE LONG-LIVED ASSETS ARE REVIEWED FOR\nIMPAIRMENT WHENEVER EVENTS OR CHANGES IN CIRCUMSTANCES INDICATE THAT THE CARRYING VALUE MAY NOT BE RECOVERABLE. DETERMINATION OF RECOVERABILITY IS BASED ON THE LOWEST LEVEL OF IDENTIFIABLE ESTIMATED UNDISCOUNTED FUTURE CASH FLOWS RESULTING FROM USE\nOF THE ASSET AND ITS EVENTUAL DISPOSITION. MEASUREMENT OF ANY IMPAIRMENT LOSS IS BASED ON THE EXCESS OF THE CARRYING VALUE OF THE ASSET OVER ITS FAIR VALUE. FAIR VALUE IS DETERMINED BASED ON THE LOWEST LEVEL OF IDENTIFIABLE ESTIMATED FUTURE CASH\nFLOWS USING DISCOUNT RATES DETERMINED BY OUR MANAGEMENT TO BE COMMENSURATE WITH THE RISK INHERENT IN OUR BUSINESS MODEL. OUR ESTIMATES OF FUTURE CASH FLOWS ATTRIBUTABLE TO OUR LONG-LIVED ASSETS REQUIRE SIGNIFICANT JUDGMENT BASED ON OUR HISTORICAL\nAND ANTICIPATED RESULTS AND ARE SUBJECT TO MANY FACTORS. DIFFERENT ASSUMPTIONS AND JUDGMENTS COULD MATERIALLY AFFECT ESTIMATED FUTURE CASH FLOWS RELATING TO OUR LONG-LIVED ASSETS WHICH COULD TRIGGER IMPAIRMENT. NO IMPAIRMENTS OF LONG-LIVED ASSETS\nWERE IDENTIFIED DURING ANY OF THE PERIODS PRESENTED.\nINVESTMENTS IN EQUITY INTERESTS.\nWE ACCOUNT FOR INVESTMENTS IN THE COMMON STOCK\nOF ENTITIES IN WHICH WE HAVE THE ABILITY TO EXERCISE SIGNIFICANT INFLUENCE BUT DO NOT OWN A MAJORITY EQUITY INTEREST OR OTHERWISE CONTROL USING THE EQUITY METHOD. IN ACCOUNTING FOR THESE INVESTMENTS WE RECORD OUR PROPORTIONATE SHARE OF THE\nENTITIES\u0092 NET INCOME OR LOSS, ONE QUARTER IN ARREARS.\nWE REVIEW OUR INVESTMENTS IN EQUITY INTERESTS FOR IMPAIRMENT WHENEVER EVENTS OR\nCHANGES IN BUSINESS CIRCUMSTANCES INDICATE THAT THE CARRYING VALUE OF THE INVESTMENT MAY NOT BE FULLY RECOVERABLE. INVESTMENTS IDENTIFIED AS HAVING AN INDICATION OF IMPAIRMENT ARE SUBJECT TO FURTHER ANALYSIS TO DETERMINE IF THE IMPAIRMENT IS\nOTHER-THAN-TEMPORARY AND THIS ANALYSIS REQUIRES ESTIMATING THE FAIR VALUE OF THE INVESTMENT. THE DETERMINATION OF FAIR VALUE OF THE INVESTMENT INVOLVES CONSIDERING FACTORS SUCH AS THE STOCK PRICES OF PUBLIC COMPANIES IN WHICH WE HAVE AN EQUITY\nINVESTMENT, CURRENT ECONOMIC AND MARKET CONDITIONS, THE OPERATING PERFORMANCE OF THE COMPANIES, INCLUDING CURRENT EARNINGS TRENDS AND FORECASTED CASH FLOWS, AND OTHER COMPANY AND INDUSTRY SPECIFIC INFORMATION. THE FAIR VALUE DETERMINATION,\nPARTICULARLY FOR INVESTMENTS IN PRIVATELY-HELD COMPANIES, REQUIRES SIGNIFICANT JUDGMENT TO DETERMINE APPROPRIATE ESTIMATES AND ASSUMPTIONS. CHANGES IN THESE ESTIMATES AND ASSUMPTIONS COULD AFFECT THE CALCULATION OF THE FAIR VALUE OF THE INVESTMENTS\nAND THE DETERMINATION OF WHETHER ANY IDENTIFIED IMPAIRMENT IS OTHER-THAN-TEMPORARY.\nSTOCK-BASED COMPENSATION EXPENSE.\nWE RECOGNIZE\nSTOCK-BASED COMPENSATION EXPENSE NET OF AN ESTIMATED FORFEITURE RATE AND THEREFORE ONLY RECOGNIZE COMPENSATION EXPENSE FOR THOSE SHARES EXPECTED TO VEST OVER THE SERVICE PERIOD OF THE AWARD. CALCULATING STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION EXPENSE REQUIRES THE\nINPUT OF HIGHLY SUBJECTIVE ASSUMPTIONS, INCLUDING THE EXPECTED TERM OF THE STOCK-BASED OPTIONS, STOCK PRICE VOLATILITY, AND THE PRE-VESTING AWARD FORFEITURE RATE. WE ESTIMATE THE EXPECTED LIFE OF OPTIONS GRANTED BASED ON HISTORICAL EXERCISE\nPATTERNS, WHICH WE BELIEVE ARE REPRESENTATIVE OF FUTURE BEHAVIOR. WE ESTIMATE THE VOLATILITY OF OUR COMMON STOCK ON THE DATE OF GRANT BASED ON THE IMPLIED VOLATILITY OF PUBLICLY TRADED OPTIONS ON OUR COMMON STOCK, WITH A TERM OF ONE YEAR OR GREATER.\nWE BELIEVE THAT IMPLIED VOLATILITY CALCULATED BASED ON ACTIVELY TRADED OPTIONS ON OUR COMMON STOCK IS A BETTER INDICATOR OF EXPECTED VOLATILITY AND FUTURE STOCK PRICE TRENDS THAN HISTORICAL VOLATILITY.\nTHEREFORE, EXPECTED VOLATILITY FOR THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2012 WAS BASED ON A MARKET-BASED IMPLIED VOLATILITY. THE ASSUMPTIONS USED IN\nCALCULATING THE FAIR VALUE OF STOCK-BASED AWARDS REPRESENT OUR BEST ESTIMATES, BUT THESE ESTIMATES INVOLVE INHERENT UNCERTAINTIES AND THE APPLICATION OF MANAGEMENT JUDGMENT. AS A RESULT, IF FACTORS CHANGE AND WE USE DIFFERENT ASSUMPTIONS, OUR\nSTOCK-BASED COMPENSATION EXPENSE COULD BE MATERIALLY DIFFERENT IN THE FUTURE. IN ADDITION, WE ARE REQUIRED TO ESTIMATE THE EXPECTED PRE-VESTING AWARD FORFEITURE RATE, AS\n59\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nWELL AS THE PROBABILITY THAT PERFORMANCE CONDITIONS THAT AFFECT THE VESTING OF CERTAIN AWARDS WILL BE ACHIEVED, AND ONLY RECOGNIZE EXPENSE FOR THOSE SHARES EXPECTED TO VEST. WE ESTIMATE THIS\nFORFEITURE RATE BASED ON HISTORICAL EXPERIENCE OF OUR STOCK-BASED AWARDS THAT ARE GRANTED AND CANCELLED BEFORE VESTING. IF OUR ACTUAL FORFEITURE RATE IS MATERIALLY DIFFERENT FROM OUR ORIGINAL ESTIMATES, THE STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION EXPENSE COULD BE\nSIGNIFICANTLY DIFFERENT FROM WHAT WE HAVE RECORDED IN THE CURRENT PERIOD. CHANGES IN THE ESTIMATED FORFEITURE RATE CAN HAVE A SIGNIFICANT EFFECT ON REPORTED STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION EXPENSE, AS THE EFFECT OF ADJUSTING THE FORFEITURE RATE FOR ALL\nCURRENT AND PREVIOUSLY RECOGNIZED EXPENSE FOR UNVESTED AWARDS IS RECOGNIZED IN THE PERIOD THE FORFEITURE ESTIMATE IS CHANGED. IN ADDITION, BECAUSE MANY OF OUR STOCK-BASED AWARDS HAVE VESTING SCHEDULES OF TWO OR THREE YEAR CLIFF VESTS, A SIGNIFICANT\nCHANGE IN OUR ACTUAL OR EXPECTED FORFEITURE EXPERIENCE WILL RESULT IN THE ADJUSTMENT OF STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION WHICH WAS RECORDED IN PRIOR YEARS FOR ALL UNVESTED AWARDS. IF THE ACTUAL FORFEITURE RATE IS HIGHER THAN THE ESTIMATED FORFEITURE RATE,\nTHEN AN ADJUSTMENT WILL BE MADE TO INCREASE THE ESTIMATED FORFEITURE RATE, WHICH WILL RESULT IN A DECREASE TO THE EXPENSE RECOGNIZED IN THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS. IF THE ACTUAL FORFEITURE RATE IS LOWER THAN THE ESTIMATED FORFEITURE RATE,\nTHEN AN ADJUSTMENT WILL BE MADE TO LOWER THE ESTIMATED FORFEITURE RATE, WHICH WILL RESULT IN AN INCREASE TO THE EXPENSE RECOGNIZED IN THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS. SEE NOTE 13\u0097\u0093EMPLOYEE BENEFITS\u0094 IN THE NOTES TO OUR\nCONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR ADDITIONAL INFORMATION.\nRECENT ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS\nSEE NOTE 1\u0097\u0093THE COMPANY AND SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES\u0094 IN THE NOTES TO OUR CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS, WHICH\nIS INCORPORATED HEREIN BY REFERENCE.","23326":"ITEM 7.    MANAGEMENT\u0092S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF\nFINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nWE BEGIN MANAGEMENT\u0092S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS WITH\nAN OVERVIEW OF OUR KEY OPERATING BUSINESS SEGMENTS AND SIGNIFICANT TRENDS. THIS OVERVIEW IS FOLLOWED BY A SUMMARY OF OUR CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES THAT WE BELIEVE ARE IMPORTANT TO UNDERSTANDING THE ASSUMPTIONS AND JUDGMENTS\nINCORPORATED IN OUR REPORTED FINANCIAL RESULTS. WE THEN PROVIDE A MORE DETAILED ANALYSIS OF OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION.\nBUSINESS OVERVIEW\nWE ARE THE WORLD\u0092S LARGEST\nPROVIDER OF ENTERPRISE SOFTWARE AND A LEADING PROVIDER OF COMPUTER HARDWARE PRODUCTS AND SERVICES THAT ARE ENGINEERED TO WORK TOGETHER IN THE CLOUD AND IN THE DATA CENTER. WE ARE A LEADER IN THE CORE TECHNOLOGIES OF CLOUD COMPUTING, INCLUDING\nDATABASE AND MIDDLEWARE AS WELL AS WEB-BASED APPLICATIONS, VIRTUALIZATION, CLUSTERING AND LARGE-SCALE SYSTEMS MANAGEMENT. WE PROVIDE CLOUD SERVICES AS WELL AS SOFTWARE AND HARDWARE PRODUCTS TO OTHER CLOUD SERVICE PROVIDERS, BOTH PUBLIC AND PRIVATE.\nORACLE DATABASE AND MIDDLEWARE SOFTWARE, APPLICATIONS SOFTWARE AND HARDWARE SYSTEMS\u0097INCLUDING COMPUTER SERVER, STORAGE AND NETWORKING PRODUCTS\u0097ARE THE BUILDING BLOCKS OF OUR OWN CLOUD SERVICES, OUR PARTNERS\u0092 CLOUD SERVICES AND OUR\nCUSTOMERS\u0092 PRIVATE CLOUD ENVIRONMENTS. OUR CUSTOMERS CAN SUBSCRIBE TO USE SELECT ORACLE SOFTWARE AND HARDWARE PRODUCTS THROUGH OUR CLOUD OFFERINGS, OR PURCHASE OUR SOFTWARE AND HARDWARE PRODUCTS AND RELATED SERVICES TO BUILD THEIR OWN PRIVATE\nCLOUD OR ON-PREMISE INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY (IT) ENVIRONMENTS. OUR STRATEGY IS TO DELIVER RELIABLE AND SCALABLE PRODUCTS AND SERVICES THAT ARE BUILT UPON INDUSTRY STANDARDS AND ARE ENGINEERED TO WORK TOGETHER OR INDEPENDENTLY. WE ALSO PURSUE NEW OR\nEMERGING GROWTH OPPORTUNITIES IN ORDER TO MAINTAIN TECHNOLOGY LEADERSHIP. OFFERING CUSTOMERS A CHOICE IN HOW THEY USE OUR PRODUCTS AND SERVICES\u0097WHILE MAINTAINING ENTERPRISE-GRADE RELIABILITY, SECURITY, AND INTEROPERABILITY\u0097IS IMPORTANT TO\nOUR CORPORATE STRATEGY.\nWE BELIEVE THAT INTERNAL GROWTH AND CONTINUED INNOVATION WITH RESPECT TO OUR SOFTWARE, HARDWARE AND SERVICES BUSINESSES ARE THE\nFOUNDATION OF OUR LONG-TERM STRATEGIC PLANS. IN FISCAL 2013, WE INVESTED $4.9 BILLION, AND IN EACH OF FISCAL 2012 AND 2011 WE INVESTED $4.5 BILLION, IN RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT TO ENHANCE OUR EXISTING PORTFOLIO OF PRODUCTS AND SERVICES AND TO\nDEVELOP NEW PRODUCTS AND SERVICES. WE CONTINUE TO FOCUS THE ENGINEERING OF OUR HARDWARE AND SOFTWARE PRODUCTS TO MAKE THEM WORK TOGETHER MORE EFFECTIVELY AND DELIVER IMPROVED COMPUTING PERFORMANCE, RELIABILITY AND SECURITY TO OUR CUSTOMERS. FOR\nEXAMPLE, ORACLE ENGINEERED SYSTEMS, WHICH INCLUDE OUR ORACLE EXADATA DATABASE MACHINE, ORACLE EXALOGIC ELASTIC CLOUD AND ORACLE SPARC SUPERCLUSTER PRODUCTS, AMONG OTHERS, COMBINE CERTAIN OF OUR HARDWARE AND SOFTWARE OFFERINGS IN A WAY THAT INCREASES\nCOMPUTING PERFORMANCE RELATIVE TO OUR COMPETITORS\u0092 PRODUCTS, CREATING TIME SAVINGS, EFFICIENCIES AND OPERATIONAL COST ADVANTAGES FOR OUR CUSTOMERS. WITH PRODUCTS THAT ARE ENGINEERED TO WORK TOGETHER, OUR CUSTOMERS CAN REDUCE MUCH OF THE\nCOMPLEXITY OF IT AND MAKE AVAILABLE RESOURCES THEY WOULD OTHERWISE SPEND ON IT OPERATIONS. IN ADDITION TO OUR INTRODUCTIONS OF NEW, INNOVATIVE HARDWARE AND SOFTWARE PRODUCTS, WE ALSO CONTINUE TO DEMONSTRATE OUR COMMITMENT TO CUSTOMER CHOICE THROUGH\nONGOING ENHANCEMENTS TO OUR EXISTING PRODUCTS, INCLUDING OUR ORACLE E-BUSINESS SUITE, SIEBEL, PEOPLESOFT AND JD EDWARDS APPLICATIONS SOFTWARE PRODUCTS.\nWE\nBELIEVE THAT AN ACTIVE ACQUISITION PROGRAM IS ANOTHER IMPORTANT ELEMENT OF OUR CORPORATE STRATEGY AS IT ENHANCES THE PRODUCTS AND SERVICES THAT WE CAN OFFER TO CUSTOMERS, EXPANDS OUR CUSTOMER BASE, PROVIDES GREATER SCALE TO ACCELERATE INNOVATION,\nGROWS OUR REVENUES AND EARNINGS AND INCREASES STOCKHOLDER VALUE. IN RECENT YEARS, WE HAVE INVESTED BILLIONS OF DOLLARS TO ACQUIRE A NUMBER OF COMPANIES, PRODUCTS, SERVICES AND TECHNOLOGIES THAT ADD TO, ARE COMPLEMENTARY TO, OR HAVE OTHERWISE\nENHANCED OUR EXISTING OFFERINGS. WE EXPECT TO CONTINUE TO ACQUIRE COMPANIES, PRODUCTS, SERVICES AND TECHNOLOGIES TO FURTHER OUR CORPORATE STRATEGY.\nWE ARE\nORGANIZED INTO THREE BUSINESSES\u0097SOFTWARE, HARDWARE SYSTEMS AND SERVICES\u0097WHICH ARE FURTHER DIVIDED INTO CERTAIN OPERATING SEGMENTS. EACH OF OUR BUSINESSES AND OPERATING SEGMENTS HAS UNIQUE CHARACTERISTICS AND FACES DIFFERENT OPPORTUNITIES\nAND CHALLENGES. ALTHOUGH WE REPORT OUR ACTUAL RESULTS IN U.S. DOLLARS, WE CONDUCT A SIGNIFICANT NUMBER OF TRANSACTIONS IN CURRENCIES OTHER THAN U.S. DOLLARS. THEREFORE, WE PRESENT CONSTANT CURRENCY INFORMATION TO PROVIDE A FRAMEWORK FOR ASSESSING\nHOW OUR UNDERLYING BUSINESSES PERFORMED EXCLUDING THE EFFECT OF FOREIGN CURRENCY RATE FLUCTUATIONS. AN OVERVIEW OF OUR THREE BUSINESSES AND RELATED OPERATING SEGMENTS FOLLOWS.\nSOFTWARE BUSINESS\nOUR SOFTWARE BUSINESS,\nWHICH REPRESENTED 74%, 70% AND 68% OF OUR TOTAL REVENUES IN FISCAL 2013, 2012 AND 2011, RESPECTIVELY, IS COMPRISED OF TWO OPERATING SEGMENTS: (1) NEW SOFTWARE LICENSES AND CLOUD SOFTWARE SUBSCRIPTIONS AND (2) SOFTWARE LICENSE UPDATES AND\nPRODUCT SUPPORT. ON A CONSTANT CURRENCY BASIS, WE EXPECT THAT OUR SOFTWARE BUSINESS\u0092 TOTAL REVENUES GENERALLY WILL CONTINUE TO INCREASE DUE TO CONTINUED DEMAND FOR OUR SOFTWARE PRODUCTS AND SUBSCRIPTION OFFERINGS, OUR SOFTWARE LICENSE UPDATES\nAND PRODUCT SUPPORT OFFERINGS, INCLUDING THE HIGH PERCENTAGE OF CUSTOMERS THAT RENEW THEIR SOFTWARE LICENSE UPDATES AND PRODUCT SUPPORT CONTRACTS, AND OUR ACQUISITIONS, WHICH SHOULD ALLOW US TO GROW OUR PROFITS AND CONTINUE TO MAKE INVESTMENTS IN\nRESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT.\n33\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nNEW SOFTWARE LICENSES AND CLOUD SOFTWARE SUBSCRIPTIONS.\nWE LICENSE OUR\nDATABASE AND MIDDLEWARE, AS WELL AS OUR APPLICATIONS SOFTWARE, AND PROVIDE ACCESS TO A BROAD RANGE OF OUR SOFTWARE OFFERINGS THROUGH CLOUD SOFTWARE SUBSCRIPTIONS CONTRACTS. OUR SOFTWARE SOLUTIONS ARE BUILT ON A STANDARDS-BASED, INTEGRATED\nARCHITECTURE THAT IS DESIGNED TO HELP CUSTOMERS REDUCE THE COST AND COMPLEXITY OF THEIR IT INFRASTRUCTURE. OUR SOFTWARE PRODUCTS ARE DESIGNED TO OPERATE ON BOTH SINGLE SERVER AND CLUSTERED SERVER CONFIGURATIONS FOR CLOUD OR ON-PREMISE IT\nENVIRONMENTS, AND TO SUPPORT A CHOICE OF OPERATING SYSTEMS INCLUDING ORACLE SOLARIS, ORACLE LINUX, MICROSOFT WINDOWS AND THIRD PARTY UNIX PRODUCTS, AMONG OTHERS. OUR CUSTOMERS INCLUDE BUSINESSES OF MANY SIZES, GOVERNMENT AGENCIES, EDUCATIONAL\nINSTITUTIONS AND RESELLERS. WE MARKET AND SELL OUR SOFTWARE PRODUCTS AND SERVICES TO THESE CUSTOMERS WITH A SALES FORCE POSITIONED TO OFFER THE COMBINATIONS THAT BEST FIT THEIR NEEDS. WE ENABLE CUSTOMERS TO EVOLVE AND TRANSFORM TO SUBSTANTIALLY ANY\nIT ENVIRONMENT AT WHATEVER PACE IS MOST APPROPRIATE FOR THEM.\nTHE GROWTH IN NEW SOFTWARE LICENSES AND CLOUD SOFTWARE SUBSCRIPTIONS REVENUES\nTHAT WE REPORT IS AFFECTED BY THE STRENGTH OF GENERAL ECONOMIC AND BUSINESS CONDITIONS, GOVERNMENTAL BUDGETARY CONSTRAINTS, THE COMPETITIVE POSITION OF OUR SOFTWARE OFFERINGS, OUR ACQUISITIONS AND FOREIGN CURRENCY FLUCTUATIONS. THE SUBSTANTIAL\nMAJORITY OF OUR NEW SOFTWARE LICENSES TRANSACTIONS IS CHARACTERIZED BY LONG SALES CYCLES AND THE TIMING OF A FEW LARGE SOFTWARE LICENSE TRANSACTIONS CAN SUBSTANTIALLY AFFECT OUR QUARTERLY NEW SOFTWARE LICENSES AND CLOUD SOFTWARE SUBSCRIPTIONS\nREVENUES. SINCE OUR NEW SOFTWARE LICENSES AND CLOUD SOFTWARE SUBSCRIPTIONS REVENUES IN A PARTICULAR QUARTER CAN BE DIFFICULT TO PREDICT AS A RESULT OF THE TIMING OF A FEW LARGE SOFTWARE LICENSE TRANSACTIONS, WE BELIEVE THAT ANALYSIS OF NEW SOFTWARE\nLICENSES AND CLOUD SOFTWARE SUBSCRIPTIONS REVENUES ON A TRAILING 4-QUARTER PERIOD (AS PROVIDED IN OUR QUARTERLY REPORTS ON FORM 10-Q) PROVIDES ADDITIONAL VISIBILITY INTO THE UNDERLYING PERFORMANCE OF THIS BUSINESS SEGMENT. NEW SOFTWARE LICENSES AND\nCLOUD SOFTWARE SUBSCRIPTIONS REVENUES REPRESENTED 28%, 27% AND 26% OF OUR TOTAL REVENUES IN FISCAL 2013, 2012 AND 2011, RESPECTIVELY. OUR CLOUD SOFTWARE SUBSCRIPTIONS CONTRACTS ARE GENERALLY ONE TO THREE YEARS IN DURATION AND WE STRIVE TO RENEW\nTHESE CONTRACTS WHEN THEY ARE ELIGIBLE FOR RENEWAL. OUR NEW SOFTWARE LICENSES AND CLOUD SOFTWARE SUBSCRIPTIONS SEGMENT\u0092S MARGIN HAS HISTORICALLY TRENDED UPWARD OVER THE COURSE OF THE FOUR QUARTERS WITHIN A PARTICULAR FISCAL YEAR DUE TO THE\nHISTORICAL UPWARD TREND OF OUR NEW SOFTWARE LICENSES REVENUES OVER THOSE QUARTERLY PERIODS AND BECAUSE THE MAJORITY OF OUR COSTS FOR THIS SEGMENT ARE PREDOMINANTLY FIXED IN THE SHORT-TERM. HOWEVER, OUR NEW SOFTWARE LICENSES AND CLOUD SOFTWARE\nSUBSCRIPTIONS SEGMENT\u0092S MARGIN HAS BEEN AND WILL CONTINUE TO BE AFFECTED BY THE FAIR VALUE ADJUSTMENTS RELATING TO THE CLOUD SOFTWARE SUBSCRIPTIONS OBLIGATIONS THAT WE ASSUMED IN OUR BUSINESS COMBINATIONS (DESCRIBED FURTHER BELOW) AND BY THE\nAMORTIZATION OF INTANGIBLE ASSETS ASSOCIATED WITH COMPANIES AND TECHNOLOGIES THAT WE HAVE ACQUIRED.\nFOR CERTAIN OF OUR ACQUIRED BUSINESSES, WE\nRECORDED ADJUSTMENTS TO REDUCE CLOUD SOFTWARE SUBSCRIPTIONS OBLIGATIONS TO THEIR ESTIMATED FAIR VALUES AT THE ACQUISITION DATES. AS A RESULT, AS REQUIRED BY BUSINESS COMBINATION ACCOUNTING RULES, WE DID NOT RECOGNIZE CLOUD SOFTWARE SUBSCRIPTIONS\nREVENUES RELATED TO CLOUD SOFTWARE SUBSCRIPTIONS CONTRACTS THAT WOULD HAVE BEEN OTHERWISE RECORDED BY THE ACQUIRED BUSINESSES AS INDEPENDENT ENTITIES IN THE AMOUNTS OF $45 MILLION AND $22 MILLION IN FISCAL 2013 AND 2012, RESPECTIVELY. TO THE EXTENT\nUNDERLYING CLOUD SOFTWARE SUBSCRIPTIONS CONTRACTS ARE RENEWED WITH US FOLLOWING AN ACQUISITION, WE WILL RECOGNIZE THE REVENUES FOR THE FULL VALUES OF THE CLOUD SOFTWARE SUBSCRIPTIONS CONTRACTS OVER THEIR RESPECTIVE CONTRACTUAL PERIODS.\nSOFTWARE LICENSE UPDATES AND PRODUCT SUPPORT.\nCUSTOMERS THAT PURCHASE SOFTWARE LICENSE UPDATES AND PRODUCT SUPPORT\nARE GRANTED RIGHTS TO UNSPECIFIED PRODUCT UPGRADES AND MAINTENANCE RELEASES AND PATCHES RELEASED DURING THE TERM OF THE SUPPORT PERIOD, AS WELL AS TECHNICAL SUPPORT ASSISTANCE. OUR SOFTWARE LICENSE UPDATES AND PRODUCT SUPPORT CONTRACTS ARE GENERALLY\nONE YEAR IN DURATION AND SUBSTANTIALLY ALL OF OUR CUSTOMERS RENEW THEIR SOFTWARE LICENSE UPDATES AND PRODUCT SUPPORT CONTRACTS ANNUALLY. THE GROWTH OF SOFTWARE LICENSE UPDATES AND PRODUCT SUPPORT REVENUES IS PRIMARILY INFLUENCED BY THREE FACTORS.\n(1) THE PERCENTAGE OF OUR SOFTWARE SUPPORT CONTRACT CUSTOMER BASE THAT RENEWS ITS SOFTWARE SUPPORT CONTRACTS, (2) THE AMOUNT OF NEW SOFTWARE SUPPORT CONTRACTS SOLD IN CONNECTION WITH THE SALE OF NEW SOFTWARE LICENSES AND (3) THE\nAMOUNT OF SOFTWARE SUPPORT CONTRACTS ASSUMED FROM COMPANIES WE HAVE ACQUIRED.\nSOFTWARE LICENSE UPDATES AND PRODUCT SUPPORT REVENUES, WHICH\nREPRESENTED 46%, 43% AND 42% OF OUR TOTAL REVENUES IN FISCAL 2013, 2012 AND 2011, RESPECTIVELY, IS OUR HIGHEST MARGIN BUSINESS UNIT. OUR SOFTWARE SUPPORT MARGINS DURING FISCAL 2013 WERE 88% AND ACCOUNTED FOR 74% OF OUR TOTAL MARGINS OVER THE SAME\nPERIOD. OUR SOFTWARE LICENSE UPDATES AND PRODUCT SUPPORT MARGINS HAVE BEEN AFFECTED BY FAIR VALUE ADJUSTMENTS RELATING TO SOFTWARE SUPPORT OBLIGATIONS ASSUMED IN BUSINESS COMBINATIONS (DESCRIBED FURTHER BELOW) AND BY AMORTIZATION OF INTANGIBLE\nASSETS. HOWEVER, OVER THE LONGER TERM, WE BELIEVE THAT SOFTWARE LICENSE UPDATES AND PRODUCT SUPPORT REVENUES AND MARGINS WILL GROW FOR THE FOLLOWING REASONS.\n\u0095\nSUBSTANTIALLY ALL OF OUR CUSTOMERS, INCLUDING CUSTOMERS FROM ACQUIRED COMPANIES, RENEW THEIR SOFTWARE SUPPORT CONTRACTS WHEN ELIGIBLE FOR RENEWAL;\n\u0095\nSUBSTANTIALLY ALL OF OUR CUSTOMERS PURCHASE SOFTWARE LICENSE UPDATES AND PRODUCT SUPPORT CONTRACTS WHEN THEY BUY NEW SOFTWARE LICENSES, RESULTING IN A\nFURTHER INCREASE IN OUR SOFTWARE SUPPORT CONTRACT BASE. EVEN IF NEW SOFTWARE LICENSES\n34\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nREVENUES GROWTH WAS FLAT, SOFTWARE LICENSE UPDATES AND PRODUCT SUPPORT REVENUES WOULD CONTINUE TO GROW IN COMPARISON TO THE CORRESPONDING PRIOR YEAR PERIODS ASSUMING CONTRACT RENEWAL AND\nCANCELLATION RATES AND FOREIGN CURRENCY RATES REMAINED RELATIVELY CONSTANT SINCE SUBSTANTIALLY ALL NEW SOFTWARE LICENSES TRANSACTIONS RESULT IN THE SALE OF SOFTWARE LICENSE UPDATES AND PRODUCT SUPPORT CONTRACTS, WHICH ADD TO OUR SOFTWARE SUPPORT\nCONTRACT BASE; AND\n\u0095\nOUR ACQUISITIONS HAVE INCREASED OUR SOFTWARE SUPPORT CONTRACT BASE, AS WELL AS THE PORTFOLIO OF PRODUCTS AVAILABLE TO BE LICENSED AND SUPPORTED.\nWE RECORDED ADJUSTMENTS TO REDUCE SOFTWARE SUPPORT OBLIGATIONS ASSUMED IN BUSINESS COMBINATIONS TO THEIR ESTIMATED FAIR\nVALUES AT THE ACQUISITION DATES. AS A RESULT, AS REQUIRED BY BUSINESS COMBINATION ACCOUNTING RULES, WE DID NOT RECOGNIZE SOFTWARE LICENSE UPDATES AND PRODUCT SUPPORT REVENUES RELATED TO SOFTWARE SUPPORT CONTRACTS THAT WOULD HAVE BEEN OTHERWISE\nRECORDED BY THE ACQUIRED BUSINESSES AS INDEPENDENT ENTITIES IN THE AMOUNTS OF $14 MILLION, $48 MILLION AND $80 MILLION IN FISCAL 2013, 2012 AND 2011, RESPECTIVELY. TO THE EXTENT UNDERLYING SOFTWARE SUPPORT CONTRACTS ARE RENEWED WITH US FOLLOWING AN\nACQUISITION, WE WILL RECOGNIZE THE REVENUES FOR THE FULL VALUES OF THE SOFTWARE SUPPORT CONTRACTS OVER THE RESPECTIVE SUPPORT PERIODS, THE MAJORITY OF WHICH ARE ONE YEAR.\nHARDWARE SYSTEMS BUSINESS\nOUR HARDWARE SYSTEMS BUSINESS IS COMPRISED OF TWO\nOPERATING SEGMENTS: (1) HARDWARE SYSTEMS PRODUCTS AND (2) HARDWARE SYSTEMS SUPPORT. OUR HARDWARE BUSINESS REPRESENTED 14%, 17% AND 19% OF OUR TOTAL REVENUES IN FISCAL 2013, 2012 AND 2011, RESPECTIVELY. WE EXPECT OUR HARDWARE BUSINESS TO\nHAVE LOWER OPERATING MARGINS AS A PERCENTAGE OF REVENUES THAN OUR SOFTWARE BUSINESS DUE TO THE INCREMENTAL COSTS WE INCUR TO PRODUCE AND DISTRIBUTE THESE PRODUCTS AND TO PROVIDE SUPPORT SERVICES, INCLUDING DIRECT MATERIALS AND LABOR COSTS. WE EXPECT\nTO MAKE INVESTMENTS IN RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT TO IMPROVE EXISTING HARDWARE PRODUCTS AND SERVICES AND TO DEVELOP NEW HARDWARE PRODUCTS AND SERVICES.\nHARDWARE SYSTEMS PRODUCTS.\nWE PROVIDE A BROAD SELECTION OF HARDWARE SYSTEMS AND RELATED SERVICES INCLUDING SERVERS, STORAGE, NETWORKING, VIRTUALIZATION SOFTWARE,\nOPERATING SYSTEMS, AND MANAGEMENT SOFTWARE TO SUPPORT DIVERSE IT ENVIRONMENTS, INCLUDING PUBLIC AND PRIVATE CLOUD COMPUTING ENVIRONMENTS. WE ENGINEER OUR HARDWARE SYSTEMS WITH VIRTUALIZATION AND MANAGEMENT CAPABILITIES TO ENABLE THE RAPID DEPLOYMENT\nAND EFFICIENT MANAGEMENT OF CLOUD AND ON-PREMISE IT INFRASTRUCTURES. OUR HARDWARE PRODUCTS SUPPORT MANY OF THE WORLD\u0092S LARGEST PUBLIC AND PRIVATE CLOUDS, INCLUDING THE ORACLE CLOUD; OUR SOFTWARE DEVELOPMENT PRIVATE CLOUD; AND OUR ORACLE\nUNIVERSITY SELF-SERVICE PRIVATE CLOUD.\nWE HAVE ALSO ENGINEERED OUR HARDWARE SYSTEMS PRODUCTS TO CREATE PERFORMANCE AND OPERATIONAL COST\nADVANTAGES FOR CUSTOMERS WHEN OUR HARDWARE AND SOFTWARE PRODUCTS ARE COMBINED AS ORACLE ENGINEERED SYSTEMS. ORACLE ENGINEERED SYSTEMS ARE CORE BUILDING BLOCKS FOR ORACLE\u0092S DATA CENTER AND CLOUD COMPUTING PRODUCTS AND SERVICES. ORACLE\nINFRASTRUCTURE-AS-A-SERVICE (IAAS), AN ON-PREMISE CLOUD OFFERING FOR DEPLOYING ORACLE\u0092S ENGINEERED SYSTEMS TO CUSTOMERS ON A SUBSCRIPTION BASIS, PROVIDES OUR CUSTOMERS WITH FLEXIBILITY IN DEPLOYMENT MODELS AND ALLOWS OUR CUSTOMERS TO COST\nEFFECTIVELY HANDLE PEAK COMPUTING WORKLOADS WITH CAPACITY ON DEMAND.\nWE OFFER A WIDE RANGE OF SERVER SYSTEMS USING OUR SPARC MICROPROCESSOR.\nOUR SPARC SERVERS RUN THE ORACLE SOLARIS OPERATING SYSTEM AND ARE DIFFERENTIATED BY THEIR RELIABILITY, SECURITY, AND SCALABILITY. OUR MID-SIZE AND LARGE SERVERS ARE DESIGNED TO OFFER GREATER PERFORMANCE AND LOWER TOTAL COST OF OWNERSHIP THAN\nMAINFRAME SYSTEMS FOR BUSINESS CRITICAL APPLICATIONS, FOR CUSTOMERS HAVING MORE COMPUTATIONALLY INTENSIVE NEEDS, AND AS PLATFORMS FOR BUILDING CLOUD COMPUTING IT ENVIRONMENTS. OUR SPARC SERVERS ARE ALSO A CORE COMPONENT OF THE ORACLE SPARC\nSUPERCLUSTER, ONE OF OUR ORACLE ENGINEERED SYSTEMS.\nWE ALSO OFFER ENTERPRISE X86 SERVERS. THESE X86 SERVERS ARE BASED ON MICROPROCESSOR\nPLATFORMS FROM INTEL CORPORATION (INTEL) AND ARE ALSO COMPATIBLE WITH ORACLE SOLARIS, ORACLE LINUX, MICROSOFT WINDOWS AND OTHER OPERATING SYSTEMS. OUR X86 SYSTEMS ARE ALSO A CORE COMPONENT OF MANY OF OUR ORACLE ENGINEERED SYSTEMS INCLUDING ORACLE\nEXADATA DATABASE MACHINE, ORACLE EXALOGIC ELASTIC CLOUD, ORACLE EXALYTICS IN-MEMORY MACHINE AND THE ORACLE BIG DATA APPLIANCE.\nOUR STORAGE\nPRODUCTS ARE DESIGNED TO SECURELY MANAGE, PROTECT, ARCHIVE AND RESTORE CUSTOMERS\u0092 MISSION CRITICAL DATA ASSETS AND CONSIST OF TAPE, DISK, FLASH AND HARDWARE-RELATED SOFTWARE INCLUDING FILE SYSTEMS SOFTWARE, BACK-UP AND ARCHIVE SOFTWARE AND\nSTORAGE MANAGEMENT SOFTWARE AND NETWORKING FOR MAINFRAME AND OPEN SYSTEMS ENVIRONMENTS.\nOUR NETWORKING AND DATA CENTER FABRIC PRODUCTS,\nINCLUDING ORACLE VIRTUAL NETWORKING, AND ORACLE INFINIBAND AND ETHERNET TECHNOLOGIES, ARE USED WITH OUR SERVER AND STORAGE PRODUCTS AND ARE INTEGRATED INTO OUR MANAGEMENT TOOLS TO HELP ENTERPRISE CUSTOMERS IMPROVE INFRASTRUCTURE PERFORMANCE, REDUCE\nCOST AND COMPLEXITY AND SIMPLIFY STORAGE AND SERVER CONNECTIVITY.\nTHE MAJORITY OF OUR HARDWARE SYSTEMS PRODUCTS ARE SOLD THROUGH INDIRECT\nCHANNELS, INCLUDING INDEPENDENT DISTRIBUTORS AND VALUE ADDED RESELLERS.\n35\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nTO PRODUCE OUR HARDWARE PRODUCTS, WE RELY ON BOTH OUR INTERNAL MANUFACTURING OPERATIONS AS WELL AS THIRD\nPARTY MANUFACTURING PARTNERS. OUR INTERNAL MANUFACTURING OPERATIONS CONSIST PRIMARILY OF MATERIALS PROCUREMENT, ASSEMBLY, TESTING AND QUALITY CONTROL OF OUR ORACLE ENGINEERED SYSTEMS AND CERTAIN OF OUR ENTERPRISE AND DATA CENTER SERVERS AND STORAGE\nSYSTEMS. FOR ALL OTHER MANUFACTURING, WE GENERALLY RELY ON THIRD PARTY MANUFACTURING PARTNERS TO PRODUCE OUR HARDWARE RELATED COMPONENTS AND HARDWARE PRODUCTS AND WE MAY INVOLVE OUR INTERNAL MANUFACTURING OPERATIONS IN THE FINAL ASSEMBLY, TESTING\nAND QUALITY CONTROL PROCESSES FOR THESE COMPONENTS AND PRODUCTS. WE DISTRIBUTE MOST OF OUR HARDWARE PRODUCTS EITHER FROM OUR FACILITIES OR PARTNER FACILITIES. WE STRIVE TO REDUCE COSTS BY SIMPLIFYING OUR MANUFACTURING PROCESSES THROUGH\nINCREASED STANDARDIZATION OF COMPONENTS ACROSS PRODUCT TYPES AND A \u0093BUILD-TO-ORDER\u0094 MANUFACTURING PROCESS IN WHICH PRODUCTS GENERALLY ARE BUILT ONLY AFTER CUSTOMERS HAVE PLACED FIRM ORDERS. WE CONTINUE TO EVOLVE HARDWARE SYSTEMS SUPPORT\nPROCESSES THAT ARE INTENDED TO PROACTIVELY IDENTIFY AND SOLVE QUALITY ISSUES AND TO INCREASE THE AMOUNT OF NEW AND RENEWED HARDWARE SYSTEMS SUPPORT CONTRACTS SOLD IN CONNECTION WITH THE SALES OF OUR HARDWARE SYSTEMS PRODUCTS.\nOUR HARDWARE SYSTEMS PRODUCTS REVENUES, COST OF HARDWARE SYSTEMS PRODUCTS AND HARDWARE SYSTEMS OPERATING MARGINS THAT WE REPORT ARE AFFECTED BY OUR\nSTRATEGY FOR AND THE COMPETITIVE POSITION OF OUR HARDWARE SYSTEMS PRODUCTS, THE STRENGTH OF GENERAL ECONOMIC AND BUSINESS CONDITIONS, GOVERNMENTAL BUDGETARY CONSTRAINTS, CERTAIN OF OUR ACQUISITIONS AND FOREIGN CURRENCY RATE FLUCTUATIONS. IN\nADDITION, OUR OPERATING MARGINS FOR OUR HARDWARE SYSTEMS PRODUCTS SEGMENT HAVE BEEN AND WILL BE AFFECTED BY THE AMORTIZATION OF INTANGIBLE ASSETS.\nWE HAVE LIMITED EXPERIENCE IN PREDICTING OUR QUARTERLY HARDWARE SYSTEMS PRODUCTS REVENUES. THE TIMING OF CUSTOMER ORDERS AND DELAYS IN OUR ABILITY TO TIMELY MANUFACTURE OR DELIVER A FEW LARGE HARDWARE\nTRANSACTIONS COULD SUBSTANTIALLY AFFECT THE AMOUNT OF HARDWARE SYSTEMS PRODUCTS REVENUES, EXPENSES AND OPERATING MARGINS THAT WE REPORT.\nHARDWARE SYSTEMS SUPPORT.\nOUR HARDWARE SYSTEMS SUPPORT OFFERINGS PROVIDE CUSTOMERS WITH SOFTWARE UPDATES FOR SOFTWARE\nCOMPONENTS THAT ARE ESSENTIAL TO THE FUNCTIONALITY OF OUR SERVER AND STORAGE PRODUCTS, SUCH AS ORACLE SOLARIS AND CERTAIN OTHER SOFTWARE PRODUCTS, AND CAN INCLUDE PRODUCT REPAIRS, MAINTENANCE SERVICES AND TECHNICAL SUPPORT SERVICES. TYPICALLY, OUR\nHARDWARE SYSTEMS SUPPORT CONTRACT ARRANGEMENTS ARE INVOICED TO THE CUSTOMER AT THE BEGINNING OF THE SUPPORT PERIOD AND ARE ONE YEAR IN DURATION. OUR HARDWARE SYSTEMS SUPPORT REVENUES THAT WE REPORT ARE INFLUENCED BY A NUMBER OF FACTORS, INCLUDING\nTHE VOLUME OF PURCHASES OF HARDWARE PRODUCTS, THE MIX OF HARDWARE PRODUCTS PURCHASED, WHETHER CUSTOMERS DECIDE TO PURCHASE HARDWARE SYSTEMS SUPPORT CONTRACTS AT OR IN CLOSE PROXIMITY TO THE TIME OF SALE, AND THE PERCENTAGE OF OUR HARDWARE SYSTEMS\nSUPPORT CONTRACT CUSTOMER BASE THAT RENEWS ITS SUPPORT CONTRACTS. ALL OF THESE FACTORS ARE HEAVILY INFLUENCED BY OUR CUSTOMERS\u0092 DECISIONS TO EITHER MAINTAIN OR UPGRADE THEIR EXISTING HARDWARE SYSTEMS\u0092 INFRASTRUCTURE TO NEWLY DEVELOPED\nTECHNOLOGIES THAT ARE AVAILABLE.\nOUR HARDWARE SYSTEMS SUPPORT MARGINS HAVE BEEN AND WILL BE AFFECTED BY CERTAIN OF OUR ACQUISITIONS AND\nRELATED ACCOUNTING INCLUDING FAIR VALUE ADJUSTMENTS RELATING TO HARDWARE SYSTEMS SUPPORT OBLIGATIONS ASSUMED AND BY THE AMORTIZATION OF INTANGIBLE ASSETS. AS REQUIRED BY BUSINESS COMBINATION ACCOUNTING RULES, WE RECORDED ADJUSTMENTS TO REDUCE OUR\nHARDWARE SYSTEMS SUPPORT REVENUES FOR CONTRACTS ASSUMED FROM OUR ACQUISITIONS TO THEIR ESTIMATED FAIR VALUES. THESE AMOUNTS WOULD HAVE BEEN RECORDED AS HARDWARE SYSTEMS SUPPORT REVENUES BY THE ACQUIRED BUSINESSES AS INDEPENDENT ENTITIES IN THE\nAMOUNTS OF $14 MILLION, $30 MILLION AND $148 MILLION FOR FISCAL 2013, 2012 AND 2011, RESPECTIVELY. TO THE EXTENT UNDERLYING HARDWARE SYSTEMS SUPPORT CONTRACTS ARE RENEWED WITH US FOLLOWING AN ACQUISITION, WE WILL RECOGNIZE THE REVENUES FOR THE FULL\nVALUES OF THE HARDWARE SYSTEMS SUPPORT CONTRACTS OVER THE RESPECTIVE SUPPORT PERIODS.\nSERVICES BUSINESS\nOUR SERVICES BUSINESS IS COMPRISED OF THE REMAINDER OF OUR OPERATING SEGMENTS AND OFFERS CONSULTING SERVICES, MANAGED CLOUD SERVICES AND EDUCATION\nSERVICES. OUR SERVICES BUSINESS, WHICH REPRESENTED 12% OF OUR TOTAL REVENUES IN FISCAL 2013 AND 13% IN EACH OF FISCAL 2012 AND 2011, HAS LOWER MARGINS THAN OUR SOFTWARE AND HARDWARE BUSINESSES. OUR SERVICES REVENUES ARE IMPACTED BY CERTAIN OF OUR\nACQUISITIONS, GENERAL ECONOMIC CONDITIONS, GOVERNMENTAL BUDGETARY CONSTRAINTS, PERSONNEL REDUCTIONS IN OUR CUSTOMERS\u0092 IT DEPARTMENTS, TIGHTER CONTROLS OVER DISCRETIONARY SPENDING AND THE GROWTH IN OUR SOFTWARE AND HARDWARE SYSTEMS PRODUCTS\nREVENUES.\nOUR CONSULTING LINE OF BUSINESS IS DESIGNED TO HELP OUR CUSTOMERS MORE SUCCESSFULLY ARCHITECT AND DEPLOY OUR PRODUCTS. OUR\nCONSULTING SERVICES INCLUDE BUSINESS AND IT STRATEGY ALIGNMENT, ENTERPRISE ARCHITECTURE PLANNING AND DESIGN, INITIAL PRODUCT IMPLEMENTATION AND INTEGRATION, AND ONGOING PRODUCT ENHANCEMENTS AND UPGRADES. THE AMOUNT OF CONSULTING REVENUES RECOGNIZED\nTENDS TO LAG THE AMOUNT OF OUR SOFTWARE AND HARDWARE SYSTEMS PRODUCTS REVENUES BY SEVERAL QUARTERS SINCE CONSULTING SERVICES, IF PURCHASED, ARE TYPICALLY SEGMENTABLE FROM THE PRODUCTS TO WHICH THEY RELATE AND ARE PERFORMED AFTER THE CUSTOMER\u0092S\nPURCHASE OF THE PRODUCTS. OUR SERVICES REVENUES AS THEY RELATE TO CONSULTING SERVICES ARE DEPENDENT UPON GENERAL ECONOMIC CONDITIONS AND THE LEVEL\n36\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nOF OUR PRODUCT REVENUES, IN PARTICULAR THE NEW SOFTWARE LICENSES SALES OF OUR APPLICATION PRODUCTS. TO THE EXTENT WE ARE ABLE TO GROW OUR PRODUCTS REVENUES, IN PARTICULAR OUR SOFTWARE APPLICATION\nPRODUCT REVENUES, WE WOULD ALSO GENERALLY EXPECT TO BE ABLE TO EVENTUALLY GROW OUR CONSULTING REVENUES.\nORACLE MANAGED CLOUD SERVICES PROVIDE\nCOMPREHENSIVE SOFTWARE AND HARDWARE MANAGEMENT AND MAINTENANCE SERVICES\u0097INCLUDING DEPLOYMENT, MANAGEMENT, MONITORING, PATCHING, SECURITY AND UPGRADE SERVICES\u0097FOR CUSTOMERS HOSTED AT OUR ORACLE DATA CENTER FACILITIES, SELECT PARTNER DATA\nCENTERS OR PHYSICALLY ON-PREMISE AT CUSTOMER FACILITIES. ADDITIONALLY, WE PROVIDE SUPPORT SERVICES, BOTH ON-PREMISE AND REMOTE, TO OUR CUSTOMERS TO ENABLE INCREASED PERFORMANCE AND HIGHER AVAILABILITY OF THEIR PRODUCTS AND SERVICES. WE BELIEVE THAT\nOUR MANAGED CLOUD SERVICES OFFERINGS PROVIDE OUR CUSTOMERS WITH GREATER VALUE AND CHOICE THROUGH INCREASED BUSINESS PERFORMANCE, REDUCED RISK, A PREDICTABLE COST AND MORE FLEXIBILITY IN TERMS OF SERVICE IN ORDER TO MAXIMIZE THE PERFORMANCE OF THEIR\nORACLE SOFTWARE AND HARDWARE PRODUCTS AND SERVICES.\nEDUCATION SERVICES PROVIDE TRAINING TO CUSTOMERS, PARTNERS AND EMPLOYEES AS A PART OF OUR\nMISSION OF ACCELERATING THE ADOPTION AND USE OF OUR SOFTWARE AND HARDWARE PRODUCTS AND TO CREATE OPPORTUNITIES TO GROW OUR PRODUCT REVENUES.\nACQUISITIONS\nAN ACTIVE\nACQUISITION PROGRAM IS ANOTHER IMPORTANT ELEMENT OF OUR CORPORATE STRATEGY. IN RECENT YEARS, WE HAVE INVESTED BILLIONS OF DOLLARS TO ACQUIRE A NUMBER OF COMPLEMENTARY COMPANIES, PRODUCTS, SERVICES AND TECHNOLOGIES INCLUDING ACME PACKET, INC. (ACME\nPACKET) IN FISCAL 2013, AND TALEO CORPORATION (TALEO) AND RIGHTNOW TECHNOLOGIES, INC. (RIGHTNOW) IN FISCAL 2012, AMONG OTHERS. WE BELIEVE OUR ACQUISITION PROGRAM STRENGTHENS OUR COMPETITIVE POSITION, ENHANCES THE PRODUCTS AND SERVICES THAT WE CAN\nOFFER TO CUSTOMERS, EXPANDS OUR CUSTOMER BASE, PROVIDES GREATER SCALE TO ACCELERATE INNOVATION, GROWS OUR REVENUES AND EARNINGS AND INCREASES STOCKHOLDER VALUE. WE EXPECT TO CONTINUE TO ACQUIRE COMPANIES, PRODUCTS, SERVICES AND TECHNOLOGIES IN\nFURTHERANCE OF OUR CORPORATE STRATEGY. NOTE 2 OF NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS INCLUDED ELSEWHERE IN THIS ANNUAL REPORT PROVIDES ADDITIONAL INFORMATION RELATED TO OUR PENDING AND RECENT ACQUISITIONS.\nWE BELIEVE WE CAN FUND OUR PENDING AND FUTURE ACQUISITIONS WITH OUR INTERNALLY AVAILABLE CASH, CASH EQUIVALENTS AND MARKETABLE SECURITIES, CASH GENERATED\nFROM OPERATIONS, ADDITIONAL BORROWINGS OR FROM THE ISSUANCE OF ADDITIONAL SECURITIES. WE ESTIMATE THE FINANCIAL IMPACT OF ANY POTENTIAL ACQUISITION WITH REGARD TO EARNINGS, OPERATING MARGIN, CASH FLOW AND RETURN ON INVESTED CAPITAL TARGETS BEFORE\nDECIDING TO MOVE FORWARD WITH AN ACQUISITION.\nCRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES\nOUR CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS ARE PREPARED IN ACCORDANCE WITH U.S. GENERALLY ACCEPTED ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES (GAAP) AS SET FORTH IN THE FINANCIAL\nACCOUNTING STANDARDS BOARD\u0092S (FASB) ACCOUNTING STANDARDS CODIFICATION (CODIFICATION) AND CONSIDER THE VARIOUS STAFF ACCOUNTING BULLETINS AND OTHER APPLICABLE GUIDANCE ISSUED BY THE UNITED STATES SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION (SEC). GAAP,\nAS SET FORTH WITHIN THE CODIFICATION, REQUIRES US TO MAKE CERTAIN ESTIMATES, JUDGMENTS AND ASSUMPTIONS. WE BELIEVE THAT THE ESTIMATES, JUDGMENTS AND ASSUMPTIONS UPON WHICH WE RELY ARE REASONABLE BASED UPON INFORMATION AVAILABLE TO US AT THE TIME\nTHAT THESE ESTIMATES, JUDGMENTS AND ASSUMPTIONS ARE MADE. THESE ESTIMATES, JUDGMENTS AND ASSUMPTIONS CAN AFFECT THE REPORTED AMOUNTS OF ASSETS AND LIABILITIES AS OF THE DATE OF THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AS WELL AS THE REPORTED AMOUNTS OF REVENUES AND\nEXPENSES DURING THE PERIODS PRESENTED. TO THE EXTENT THERE ARE DIFFERENCES BETWEEN THESE ESTIMATES, JUDGMENTS OR ASSUMPTIONS AND ACTUAL RESULTS, OUR FINANCIAL STATEMENTS WILL BE AFFECTED. THE ACCOUNTING POLICIES THAT REFLECT OUR MORE SIGNIFICANT\nESTIMATES, JUDGMENTS AND ASSUMPTIONS AND WHICH WE BELIEVE ARE THE MOST CRITICAL TO AID IN FULLY UNDERSTANDING AND EVALUATING OUR REPORTED FINANCIAL RESULTS INCLUDE THE FOLLOWING.\n\u0095\nREVENUE RECOGNITION\n\u0095\nBUSINESS COMBINATIONS\n\u0095\nGOODWILL AND INTANGIBLE ASSETS\u0097IMPAIRMENT ASSESSMENTS\n\u0095\nACCOUNTING FOR INCOME TAXES\n\u0095\nLEGAL AND OTHER CONTINGENCIES\n\u0095\nSTOCK-BASED COMPENSATION\n\u0095\nALLOWANCES FOR DOUBTFUL ACCOUNTS\n37\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nIN MANY CASES, THE ACCOUNTING TREATMENT OF A PARTICULAR TRANSACTION IS SPECIFICALLY DICTATED BY GAAP AND\nDOES NOT REQUIRE MANAGEMENT\u0092S JUDGMENT IN ITS APPLICATION. THERE ARE ALSO AREAS IN WHICH MANAGEMENT\u0092S JUDGMENT IN SELECTING AMONG AVAILABLE ALTERNATIVES WOULD NOT PRODUCE A MATERIALLY DIFFERENT RESULT. OUR SENIOR MANAGEMENT HAS REVIEWED\nOUR CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND RELATED DISCLOSURES WITH THE FINANCE AND AUDIT COMMITTEE OF THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS.\nREVENUE\nRECOGNITION\nOUR SOURCES OF REVENUES INCLUDE: (1) SOFTWARE, WHICH INCLUDES NEW SOFTWARE LICENSES REVENUES EARNED FROM GRANTING\nLICENSES TO USE OUR SOFTWARE PRODUCTS AND FEES FROM CLOUD SOFTWARE SUBSCRIPTIONS OFFERINGS, AND SOFTWARE LICENSE UPDATES AND PRODUCT SUPPORT REVENUES; (2) HARDWARE SYSTEMS, WHICH INCLUDES THE SALE OF HARDWARE SYSTEMS PRODUCTS INCLUDING COMPUTER\nSERVERS, STORAGE PRODUCTS, NETWORKING AND DATA CENTER FABRIC PRODUCTS, AND FEES FROM INFRASTRUCTURE-AS-A-SERVICE (IAAS) OFFERINGS, AND HARDWARE SYSTEMS SUPPORT REVENUES; AND (3) SERVICES, WHICH INCLUDES SOFTWARE AND HARDWARE RELATED SERVICES\nINCLUDING CONSULTING, MANAGED CLOUD SERVICES AND EDUCATION REVENUES. REVENUES GENERALLY ARE RECOGNIZED NET OF ANY TAXES COLLECTED FROM CUSTOMERS AND SUBSEQUENTLY REMITTED TO GOVERNMENTAL AUTHORITIES.\nREVENUE RECOGNITION FOR SOFTWARE PRODUCTS AND SOFTWARE RELATED SERVICES (SOFTWARE ELEMENTS)\nNEW SOFTWARE LICENSES REVENUES PRIMARILY REPRESENT FEES EARNED FROM GRANTING CUSTOMERS LICENSES TO USE OUR DATABASE, MIDDLEWARE AND APPLICATIONS SOFTWARE\nAND EXCLUDE CLOUD SOFTWARE SUBSCRIPTIONS REVENUES AND REVENUES DERIVED FROM SOFTWARE LICENSE UPDATES, WHICH ARE INCLUDED IN SOFTWARE LICENSE UPDATES AND PRODUCT SUPPORT REVENUES. THE BASIS FOR OUR NEW SOFTWARE LICENSES REVENUE RECOGNITION IS\nSUBSTANTIALLY GOVERNED BY THE ACCOUNTING GUIDANCE CONTAINED IN ASC 985-605,\nSOFTWARE-REVENUE RECOGNITION.\nWE EXERCISE JUDGMENT AND USE ESTIMATES IN CONNECTION WITH THE DETERMINATION OF THE AMOUNT OF SOFTWARE AND SOFTWARE RELATED SERVICES\nREVENUES TO BE RECOGNIZED IN EACH ACCOUNTING PERIOD.\nFOR SOFTWARE LICENSE ARRANGEMENTS THAT DO NOT REQUIRE SIGNIFICANT MODIFICATION OR\nCUSTOMIZATION OF THE UNDERLYING SOFTWARE, WE RECOGNIZE NEW SOFTWARE LICENSES REVENUES WHEN: (1) WE ENTER INTO A LEGALLY BINDING ARRANGEMENT WITH A CUSTOMER FOR THE LICENSE OF SOFTWARE; (2) WE DELIVER THE PRODUCTS; (3) THE SALE PRICE\nIS FIXED OR DETERMINABLE AND FREE OF CONTINGENCIES OR SIGNIFICANT UNCERTAINTIES; AND (4) COLLECTION IS PROBABLE. REVENUES THAT ARE NOT RECOGNIZED AT THE TIME OF SALE BECAUSE THE FOREGOING CONDITIONS ARE NOT MET, ARE RECOGNIZED WHEN THOSE\nCONDITIONS ARE SUBSEQUENTLY MET.\nSUBSTANTIALLY ALL OF OUR SOFTWARE LICENSE ARRANGEMENTS DO NOT INCLUDE ACCEPTANCE PROVISIONS. HOWEVER, IF\nACCEPTANCE PROVISIONS EXIST AS PART OF PUBLIC POLICY, FOR EXAMPLE, IN AGREEMENTS WITH GOVERNMENT ENTITIES WHERE ACCEPTANCE PERIODS ARE REQUIRED BY LAW, OR WITHIN PREVIOUSLY EXECUTED TERMS AND CONDITIONS THAT ARE REFERENCED IN THE CURRENT AGREEMENT\nAND ARE SHORT-TERM IN NATURE, WE GENERALLY RECOGNIZE REVENUES UPON DELIVERY PROVIDED THE ACCEPTANCE TERMS ARE PERFUNCTORY AND ALL OTHER REVENUE RECOGNITION CRITERIA HAVE BEEN MET. IF ACCEPTANCE PROVISIONS ARE NOT PERFUNCTORY (FOR EXAMPLE, ACCEPTANCE\nPROVISIONS THAT ARE LONG-TERM IN NATURE OR ARE NOT INCLUDED AS STANDARD TERMS OF AN ARRANGEMENT), REVENUES ARE RECOGNIZED UPON THE EARLIER OF RECEIPT OF WRITTEN CUSTOMER ACCEPTANCE OR EXPIRATION OF THE ACCEPTANCE PERIOD.\nTHE VAST MAJORITY OF OUR SOFTWARE LICENSE ARRANGEMENTS INCLUDE SOFTWARE LICENSE UPDATES AND PRODUCT SUPPORT CONTRACTS, WHICH ARE ENTERED INTO AT THE\nCUSTOMER\u0092S OPTION AND ARE RECOGNIZED RATABLY OVER THE TERM OF THE ARRANGEMENT, TYPICALLY ONE YEAR. SOFTWARE LICENSE UPDATES PROVIDE CUSTOMERS WITH RIGHTS TO UNSPECIFIED SOFTWARE PRODUCT UPGRADES, MAINTENANCE RELEASES AND PATCHES RELEASED DURING\nTHE TERM OF THE SUPPORT PERIOD. PRODUCT SUPPORT INCLUDES INTERNET ACCESS TO TECHNICAL CONTENT, AS WELL AS INTERNET AND TELEPHONE ACCESS TO TECHNICAL SUPPORT PERSONNEL. SOFTWARE LICENSE UPDATES AND PRODUCT SUPPORT CONTRACTS ARE GENERALLY PRICED AS A\nPERCENTAGE OF THE NET NEW SOFTWARE LICENSES FEES. SUBSTANTIALLY ALL OF OUR CUSTOMERS RENEW THEIR SOFTWARE LICENSE UPDATES AND PRODUCT SUPPORT CONTRACTS ANNUALLY.\nREVENUE RECOGNITION FOR MULTIPLE-ELEMENT ARRANGEMENTS\n\u0097\nSOFTWARE PRODUCTS AND SOFTWARE RELATED SERVICES (SOFTWARE ARRANGEMENTS)\nWE OFTEN ENTER INTO ARRANGEMENTS WITH CUSTOMERS THAT PURCHASE BOTH SOFTWARE RELATED PRODUCTS AND SOFTWARE RELATED SERVICES FROM US AT THE SAME TIME, OR WITHIN CLOSE PROXIMITY OF ONE ANOTHER (REFERRED TO\nAS SOFTWARE RELATED MULTIPLE-ELEMENT ARRANGEMENTS). SUCH SOFTWARE RELATED MULTIPLE-ELEMENT ARRANGEMENTS INCLUDE THE SALE OF OUR SOFTWARE PRODUCTS, SOFTWARE LICENSE UPDATES AND PRODUCT SUPPORT CONTRACTS AND OTHER SOFTWARE RELATED SERVICES WHEREBY\nSOFTWARE LICENSE DELIVERY IS FOLLOWED BY THE SUBSEQUENT OR CONTEMPORANEOUS DELIVERY OF THE OTHER ELEMENTS. FOR THOSE SOFTWARE RELATED MULTIPLE-ELEMENT ARRANGEMENTS, WE HAVE APPLIED THE RESIDUAL METHOD TO DETERMINE THE AMOUNT OF SOFTWARE LICENSE\nREVENUES TO BE RECOGNIZED PURSUANT TO ASC 985-605. UNDER THE RESIDUAL METHOD, IF FAIR VALUE EXISTS FOR UNDELIVERED ELEMENTS IN A MULTIPLE-ELEMENT ARRANGEMENT, SUCH FAIR VALUE OF THE UNDELIVERED\n38\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nELEMENTS IS DEFERRED WITH THE REMAINING PORTION OF THE ARRANGEMENT CONSIDERATION RECOGNIZED UPON DELIVERY OF THE SOFTWARE LICENSE OR SERVICES ARRANGEMENT. WE ALLOCATE THE FAIR VALUE OF EACH\nELEMENT OF A SOFTWARE RELATED MULTIPLE-ELEMENT ARRANGEMENT BASED UPON ITS FAIR VALUE AS DETERMINED BY OUR VENDOR SPECIFIC OBJECTIVE EVIDENCE (VSOE\u0097DESCRIBED FURTHER BELOW), WITH ANY REMAINING AMOUNT ALLOCATED TO THE SOFTWARE LICENSE.\nREVENUE RECOGNITION FOR HARDWARE SYSTEMS PRODUCTS, HARDWARE SYSTEMS RELATED SERVICES, CLOUD SOFTWARE SUBSCRIPTIONS AND IAAS OFFERINGS\n(NONSOFTWARE ELEMENTS)\nREVENUES FROM THE SALE OF HARDWARE SYSTEMS PRODUCTS REPRESENT AMOUNTS EARNED PRIMARILY FROM THE SALE OF COMPUTER\nSERVERS, STORAGE AND NETWORKING PRODUCTS. OUR REVENUE RECOGNITION POLICY FOR THESE NONSOFTWARE DELIVERABLES AND OTHER NONSOFTWARE DELIVERABLES INCLUDING HARDWARE SYSTEMS RELATED SERVICES AND CLOUD SOFTWARE SUBSCRIPTIONS OFFERINGS IS BASED UPON THE\nACCOUNTING GUIDANCE CONTAINED IN ASC 605,\nREVENUE RECOGNITION\n, AND WE EXERCISE JUDGMENT AND USE ESTIMATES IN CONNECTION WITH THE DETERMINATION OF THE AMOUNT OF HARDWARE SYSTEMS PRODUCTS REVENUES, HARDWARE SYSTEMS RELATED SERVICES REVENUES AND\nCLOUD SOFTWARE SUBSCRIPTIONS REVENUES TO BE RECOGNIZED IN EACH ACCOUNTING PERIOD.\nREVENUES FROM THE SALES OF OUR NONSOFTWARE ELEMENTS ARE\nRECOGNIZED WHEN: (1) PERSUASIVE EVIDENCE OF AN ARRANGEMENT EXISTS; (2) WE DELIVER THE PRODUCTS AND PASSAGE OF THE TITLE TO THE BUYER OCCURS; (3) THE SALE PRICE IS FIXED OR DETERMINABLE; AND (4) COLLECTION IS REASONABLY ASSURED.\nREVENUES THAT ARE NOT RECOGNIZED AT THE TIME OF SALE BECAUSE THE FOREGOING CONDITIONS ARE NOT MET ARE RECOGNIZED WHEN THOSE CONDITIONS ARE SUBSEQUENTLY MET. WHEN APPLICABLE, WE REDUCE REVENUES FOR ESTIMATED RETURNS OR CERTAIN OTHER INCENTIVE\nPROGRAMS WHERE WE HAVE THE ABILITY TO SUFFICIENTLY ESTIMATE THE EFFECTS OF THESE ITEMS. WHERE AN ARRANGEMENT IS SUBJECT TO ACCEPTANCE CRITERIA AND THE ACCEPTANCE PROVISIONS ARE NOT PERFUNCTORY (FOR EXAMPLE, ACCEPTANCE PROVISIONS THAT ARE LONG-TERM\nIN NATURE OR ARE NOT INCLUDED AS STANDARD TERMS OF AN ARRANGEMENT), REVENUES ARE RECOGNIZED UPON THE EARLIER OF RECEIPT OF WRITTEN CUSTOMER ACCEPTANCE OR EXPIRATION OF THE ACCEPTANCE PERIOD.\nOUR HARDWARE SYSTEMS SUPPORT OFFERINGS GENERALLY PROVIDE CUSTOMERS WITH SOFTWARE UPDATES FOR THE SOFTWARE COMPONENTS THAT ARE ESSENTIAL TO THE FUNCTIONALITY OF OUR SERVER AND STORAGE PRODUCTS AND CAN ALSO\nINCLUDE PRODUCT REPAIRS, MAINTENANCE SERVICES AND TECHNICAL SUPPORT SERVICES. HARDWARE SYSTEMS SUPPORT CONTRACTS ARE GENERALLY PRICED AS A PERCENTAGE OF THE NET HARDWARE SYSTEMS PRODUCTS FEES. HARDWARE SYSTEMS SUPPORT CONTRACTS ARE ENTERED INTO AT\nTHE CUSTOMER\u0092S OPTION AND ARE RECOGNIZED RATABLY OVER THE CONTRACTUAL TERM OF THE ARRANGEMENTS, WHICH ARE TYPICALLY ONE YEAR.\nOUR CLOUD\nSOFTWARE SUBSCRIPTIONS OFFERINGS GENERALLY PROVIDE CUSTOMERS ACCESS TO CERTAIN OF OUR SOFTWARE WITHIN A CLOUD-BASED IT ENVIRONMENT THAT WE MANAGE AND OFFER TO CUSTOMERS ON A SUBSCRIPTION BASIS. REVENUES FOR OUR CLOUD SOFTWARE SUBSCRIPTIONS OFFERINGS\nARE RECOGNIZED RATABLY OVER THE CONTRACT TERM COMMENCING WITH THE DATE OUR SERVICE IS MADE AVAILABLE TO CUSTOMERS AND ALL OTHER REVENUE RECOGNITION CRITERIA HAVE BEEN SATISFIED.\nOUR IAAS OFFERINGS ARE ON-PREMISE CLOUD OFFERINGS FOR DEPLOYING CERTAIN OF ORACLE\u0092S ENGINEERED SYSTEMS AND SUPPORT SERVICES TO CUSTOMERS ON A SUBSCRIPTION BASIS. CUSTOMERS THAT ENTER INTO IAAS\nARRANGEMENTS ARE ALSO ABLE TO PURCHASE ADDITIONAL CAPACITY ON DEMAND. OUR REVENUE RECOGNITION POLICY FOR IAAS OFFERINGS IS IN ACCORDANCE WITH ASC 605 AND ASC 840,\nLEASES\n. SUBSTANTIALLY ALL OF OUR IAAS OFFERINGS ARE ACCOUNTED FOR AS OPERATING\nLEASES AS OUR CONTRACTS ARE STRUCTURED SO THAT THE TERM OF THE ARRANGEMENT IS LESS THAN 75% OF THE ECONOMIC LIFE OF THE EQUIPMENT AND THE PRESENT VALUE OF THE MINIMUM FIXED PAYMENTS ARE LESS THAN 90% OF THE FAIR MARKET VALUE OF THE EQUIPMENT AT THE\nINCEPTION OF THE ARRANGEMENT. OUR EVALUATION OF USEFUL LIFE IS BASED ON OUR HISTORICAL PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT CYCLES AND OUR HISTORICAL CUSTOMER HARDWARE UPGRADE CYCLES. CAPACITY ON DEMAND IS A CONTINGENT PAYMENT AND IS THEREFORE EXCLUDED FROM OUR\nASSESSMENT OF THE NET PRESENT VALUE OF FIXED PAYMENTS. REVENUE FOR CAPACITY ON DEMAND IS RECOGNIZED IN THE PERIOD OUR CUSTOMERS ACCESS ADDITIONAL CAPACITY PROVIDED ALL OTHER REVENUE RECOGNITION CRITERIA HAVE BEEN MET.\nREVENUE RECOGNITION FOR MULTIPLE-ELEMENT ARRANGEMENTS\n\u0097\nHARDWARE SYSTEMS PRODUCTS AND HARDWARE SYSTEMS RELATED SERVICES (NONSOFTWARE\nARRANGEMENTS)\nWE ENTER INTO ARRANGEMENTS WITH CUSTOMERS THAT PURCHASE BOTH NONSOFTWARE RELATED PRODUCTS AND SERVICES FROM US AT THE SAME\nTIME, OR WITHIN CLOSE PROXIMITY OF ONE ANOTHER (REFERRED TO AS NONSOFTWARE MULTIPLE-ELEMENT ARRANGEMENTS). EACH ELEMENT WITHIN A NONSOFTWARE MULTIPLE-ELEMENT ARRANGEMENT IS ACCOUNTED FOR AS A SEPARATE UNIT OF ACCOUNTING PROVIDED THE FOLLOWING\nCRITERIA ARE MET: THE DELIVERED PRODUCTS OR SERVICES HAVE VALUE TO THE CUSTOMER ON A STANDALONE BASIS; AND FOR AN ARRANGEMENT THAT INCLUDES A GENERAL RIGHT OF RETURN RELATIVE TO THE DELIVERED PRODUCTS OR SERVICES, DELIVERY OR PERFORMANCE OF THE\nUNDELIVERED PRODUCT OR SERVICE IS CONSIDERED PROBABLE AND IS SUBSTANTIALLY CONTROLLED BY US. WE CONSIDER A DELIVERABLE TO HAVE STANDALONE VALUE IF THE PRODUCT OR SERVICE IS SOLD SEPARATELY BY US OR ANOTHER VENDOR OR COULD BE RESOLD BY THE CUSTOMER.\nFURTHER, OUR REVENUE ARRANGEMENTS GENERALLY DO NOT INCLUDE A GENERAL RIGHT OF RETURN RELATIVE TO THE DELIVERED PRODUCTS. WHERE THE AFOREMENTIONED CRITERIA FOR A SEPARATE UNIT OF\n39\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nACCOUNTING ARE NOT MET, THE DELIVERABLE IS COMBINED WITH THE UNDELIVERED ELEMENT(S) AND TREATED AS A SINGLE UNIT OF ACCOUNTING FOR THE PURPOSES OF ALLOCATION OF THE ARRANGEMENT CONSIDERATION AND\nREVENUE RECOGNITION. FOR THOSE UNITS OF ACCOUNTING THAT INCLUDE MORE THAN ONE DELIVERABLE BUT ARE TREATED AS A SINGLE UNIT OF ACCOUNTING, WE GENERALLY RECOGNIZE REVENUES OVER THE DELIVERY PERIOD. FOR THE PURPOSES OF REVENUE CLASSIFICATION OF THE\nELEMENTS THAT ARE ACCOUNTED FOR AS A SINGLE UNIT OF ACCOUNTING, WE ALLOCATE REVENUE TO THE RESPECTIVE REVENUE LINE ITEMS WITHIN OUR CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF OPERATIONS BASED ON A RATIONAL AND CONSISTENT METHODOLOGY UTILIZING OUR BEST ESTIMATE OF\nRELATIVE SELLING PRICES OF SUCH ELEMENTS.\nFOR OUR NONSOFTWARE MULTIPLE-ELEMENT ARRANGEMENTS, WE ALLOCATE REVENUE TO EACH ELEMENT BASED ON A SELLING PRICE\nHIERARCHY AT THE ARRANGEMENT\u0092S INCEPTION. THE SELLING PRICE FOR EACH ELEMENT IS BASED UPON THE FOLLOWING SELLING PRICE HIERARCHY: VSOE IF AVAILABLE, THIRD PARTY EVIDENCE (TPE) IF VSOE IS NOT AVAILABLE, OR ESTIMATED SELLING PRICE (ESP) IF\nNEITHER VSOE NOR TPE ARE AVAILABLE (A DESCRIPTION AS TO HOW WE DETERMINE VSOE, TPE AND ESP IS PROVIDED BELOW). IF A TANGIBLE HARDWARE SYSTEMS PRODUCT INCLUDES SOFTWARE, WE DETERMINE WHETHER THE TANGIBLE HARDWARE SYSTEMS PRODUCT AND THE SOFTWARE WORK\nTOGETHER TO DELIVER THE PRODUCT\u0092S ESSENTIAL FUNCTIONALITY AND, IF SO, THE ENTIRE PRODUCT IS TREATED AS A NONSOFTWARE DELIVERABLE. THE TOTAL ARRANGEMENT CONSIDERATION IS ALLOCATED TO EACH SEPARATE UNIT OF ACCOUNTING FOR EACH OF THE NONSOFTWARE\nDELIVERABLES USING THE RELATIVE SELLING PRICES OF EACH UNIT BASED ON THE AFOREMENTIONED SELLING PRICE HIERARCHY. WE LIMIT THE AMOUNT OF REVENUE RECOGNIZED FOR DELIVERED ELEMENTS TO AN AMOUNT THAT IS NOT CONTINGENT UPON FUTURE DELIVERY OF ADDITIONAL\nPRODUCTS OR SERVICES OR MEETING OF ANY SPECIFIED PERFORMANCE CONDITIONS.\nWHEN POSSIBLE, WE ESTABLISH VSOE OF SELLING PRICE FOR DELIVERABLES IN SOFTWARE\nAND NONSOFTWARE MULTIPLE-ELEMENT ARRANGEMENTS USING THE PRICE CHARGED FOR A DELIVERABLE WHEN SOLD SEPARATELY AND FOR SOFTWARE LICENSE UPDATES AND PRODUCT SUPPORT AND HARDWARE SYSTEMS SUPPORT, BASED ON THE RENEWAL RATES OFFERED TO CUSTOMERS. TPE IS\nESTABLISHED BY EVALUATING SIMILAR AND INTERCHANGEABLE COMPETITOR PRODUCTS OR SERVICES IN STANDALONE ARRANGEMENTS WITH SIMILARLY SITUATED CUSTOMERS. IF WE ARE UNABLE TO DETERMINE THE SELLING PRICE BECAUSE VSOE OR TPE DOES NOT EXIST, WE DETERMINE ESP\nFOR THE PURPOSES OF ALLOCATING THE ARRANGEMENT BY REVIEWING HISTORICAL TRANSACTIONS, INCLUDING TRANSACTIONS WHEREBY THE DELIVERABLE WAS SOLD ON A STANDALONE BASIS AND CONSIDERING SEVERAL OTHER EXTERNAL AND INTERNAL FACTORS INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED\nTO, PRICING PRACTICES INCLUDING DISCOUNTING, MARGIN OBJECTIVES, COMPETITION, CONTRACTUALLY STATED PRICES, THE GEOGRAPHIES IN WHICH WE OFFER OUR PRODUCTS AND SERVICES, THE TYPE OF CUSTOMER (I.E. DISTRIBUTOR, VALUE ADDED RESELLER, GOVERNMENT AGENCY\nAND DIRECT END USER, AMONG OTHERS) AND THE STAGE OF THE PRODUCT LIFECYCLE. THE DETERMINATION OF ESP IS MADE THROUGH CONSULTATION WITH AND APPROVAL BY OUR MANAGEMENT, TAKING INTO CONSIDERATION OUR PRICING MODEL AND GO-TO-MARKET STRATEGY. AS OUR, OR\nOUR COMPETITORS\u0092, PRICING AND GO-TO-MARKET STRATEGIES EVOLVE, WE MAY MODIFY OUR PRICING PRACTICES IN THE FUTURE, WHICH COULD RESULT IN CHANGES TO OUR DETERMINATION OF VSOE, TPE AND ESP. AS A RESULT, OUR FUTURE REVENUE RECOGNITION FOR\nMULTIPLE-ELEMENT ARRANGEMENTS COULD DIFFER MATERIALLY FROM OUR RESULTS IN THE CURRENT PERIOD. SELLING PRICES ARE ANALYZED ON AN ANNUAL BASIS OR MORE FREQUENTLY IF WE EXPERIENCE SIGNIFICANT CHANGES IN OUR SELLING PRICES.\nREVENUE RECOGNITION POLICIES APPLICABLE TO BOTH SOFTWARE AND NONSOFTWARE ELEMENTS\nREVENUE RECOGNITION FOR MULTIPLE-ELEMENT ARRANGEMENTS\n\u0097\nARRANGEMENTS WITH SOFTWARE AND NONSOFTWARE ELEMENTS\nWE ALSO ENTER INTO MULTIPLE-ELEMENT ARRANGEMENTS THAT MAY INCLUDE A COMBINATION OF OUR VARIOUS SOFTWARE RELATED AND NONSOFTWARE RELATED PRODUCTS AND SERVICES\nOFFERINGS INCLUDING HARDWARE SYSTEMS PRODUCTS, HARDWARE SYSTEMS SUPPORT, NEW SOFTWARE LICENSES, SOFTWARE LICENSE UPDATES AND PRODUCT SUPPORT, CLOUD SOFTWARE SUBSCRIPTIONS AND IAAS OFFERINGS, CONSULTING, MANAGED CLOUD SERVICES AND EDUCATION. IN SUCH\nARRANGEMENTS, WE FIRST ALLOCATE THE TOTAL ARRANGEMENT CONSIDERATION BASED ON THE RELATIVE SELLING PRICES OF THE SOFTWARE GROUP OF ELEMENTS AS A WHOLE AND TO THE NONSOFTWARE ELEMENTS. WE THEN FURTHER ALLOCATE CONSIDERATION WITHIN THE SOFTWARE GROUP\nTO THE RESPECTIVE ELEMENTS WITHIN THAT GROUP FOLLOWING THE GUIDANCE IN ASC 985-605 AND OUR POLICIES AS DESCRIBED ABOVE. AFTER THE ARRANGEMENT CONSIDERATION HAS BEEN ALLOCATED TO THE ELEMENTS, WE ACCOUNT FOR EACH RESPECTIVE ELEMENT IN THE ARRANGEMENT\nAS DESCRIBED ABOVE.\nOTHER REVENUE RECOGNITION POLICIES APPLICABLE TO SOFTWARE AND NONSOFTWARE ELEMENTS\nMANY OF OUR SOFTWARE ARRANGEMENTS INCLUDE CONSULTING IMPLEMENTATION SERVICES SOLD SEPARATELY UNDER CONSULTING ENGAGEMENT CONTRACTS AND ARE INCLUDED AS A PART\nOF OUR SERVICES BUSINESS. CONSULTING REVENUES FROM THESE ARRANGEMENTS ARE GENERALLY ACCOUNTED FOR SEPARATELY FROM NEW SOFTWARE LICENSES REVENUES BECAUSE THE ARRANGEMENTS QUALIFY AS SERVICES TRANSACTIONS AS DEFINED IN ASC 985-605. THE MORE\nSIGNIFICANT FACTORS CONSIDERED IN DETERMINING WHETHER THE REVENUES SHOULD BE ACCOUNTED FOR SEPARATELY INCLUDE THE NATURE OF SERVICES (I.E. CONSIDERATION OF WHETHER THE SERVICES ARE ESSENTIAL TO THE FUNCTIONALITY OF THE LICENSED PRODUCT), DEGREE OF\nRISK, AVAILABILITY OF SERVICES FROM OTHER VENDORS, TIMING OF PAYMENTS AND IMPACT OF MILESTONES OR ACCEPTANCE CRITERIA ON THE REALIZABILITY OF THE SOFTWARE LICENSE FEE. REVENUES FOR CONSULTING SERVICES ARE GENERALLY RECOGNIZED AS THE SERVICES ARE\nPERFORMED. IF\n40\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nTHERE IS A SIGNIFICANT UNCERTAINTY ABOUT THE PROJECT COMPLETION OR RECEIPT OF PAYMENT FOR THE CONSULTING SERVICES, REVENUES ARE DEFERRED UNTIL THE UNCERTAINTY IS SUFFICIENTLY RESOLVED. WE\nESTIMATE THE PROPORTIONAL PERFORMANCE ON CONTRACTS WITH FIXED OR \u0093NOT TO EXCEED\u0094 FEES ON A MONTHLY BASIS UTILIZING HOURS INCURRED TO DATE AS A PERCENTAGE OF TOTAL ESTIMATED HOURS TO COMPLETE THE PROJECT. IF WE DO NOT HAVE A SUFFICIENT\nBASIS TO MEASURE PROGRESS TOWARDS COMPLETION, REVENUES ARE RECOGNIZED WHEN WE RECEIVE FINAL ACCEPTANCE FROM THE CUSTOMER THAT THE SERVICES HAVE BEEN COMPLETED. WHEN TOTAL COST ESTIMATES EXCEED REVENUES, WE ACCRUE FOR THE ESTIMATED LOSSES IMMEDIATELY\nUSING COST ESTIMATES THAT ARE BASED UPON AN AVERAGE FULLY BURDENED DAILY RATE APPLICABLE TO THE CONSULTING ORGANIZATION DELIVERING THE SERVICES. THE COMPLEXITY OF THE ESTIMATION PROCESS AND FACTORS RELATING TO THE ASSUMPTIONS, RISKS AND\nUNCERTAINTIES INHERENT WITH THE APPLICATION OF THE PROPORTIONAL PERFORMANCE METHOD OF ACCOUNTING AFFECTS THE AMOUNTS OF REVENUES AND RELATED EXPENSES REPORTED IN OUR CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS. A NUMBER OF INTERNAL AND EXTERNAL FACTORS CAN\nAFFECT OUR ESTIMATES, INCLUDING LABOR RATES, UTILIZATION AND EFFICIENCY VARIANCES AND SPECIFICATION AND TESTING REQUIREMENT CHANGES.\nOUR\nMANAGED CLOUD SERVICES ARE OFFERED AS STANDALONE ARRANGEMENTS OR AS A PART OF ARRANGEMENTS TO CUSTOMERS BUYING NEW SOFTWARE LICENSES OR HARDWARE SYSTEMS PRODUCTS AND SERVICES. ORACLE MANAGED CLOUD SERVICES ARE DESIGNED TO PROVIDE COMPREHENSIVE\nSOFTWARE AND HARDWARE MANAGEMENT AND MAINTENANCE SERVICES FOR CUSTOMERS HOSTED AT OUR ORACLE DATA CENTER FACILITIES, SELECT PARTNER DATA CENTERS OR PHYSICALLY ON-PREMISE AT CUSTOMER FACILITIES. ADDITIONALLY, WE PROVIDE SUPPORT SERVICES, BOTH\nON-PREMISE AND REMOTE, TO ORACLE CUSTOMERS TO ENABLE INCREASED PERFORMANCE AND HIGHER AVAILABILITY OF THEIR PRODUCTS AND SERVICES. DEPENDING UPON THE NATURE OF THE ARRANGEMENT, REVENUES FROM MANAGED CLOUD SERVICES ARE RECOGNIZED AS SERVICES ARE\nPERFORMED OR RATABLY OVER THE TERM OF THE SERVICE PERIOD, WHICH IS GENERALLY ONE YEAR OR LESS.\nEDUCATION REVENUES ARE ALSO A PART OF OUR\nSERVICES BUSINESS AND INCLUDE INSTRUCTOR-LED, MEDIA-BASED AND INTERNET-BASED TRAINING IN THE USE OF OUR SOFTWARE AND HARDWARE PRODUCTS. EDUCATION REVENUES ARE RECOGNIZED AS THE CLASSES OR OTHER EDUCATION OFFERINGS ARE DELIVERED.\nIF AN ARRANGEMENT CONTAINS MULTIPLE ELEMENTS AND DOES NOT QUALIFY FOR SEPARATE ACCOUNTING FOR THE PRODUCT AND SERVICE TRANSACTIONS, THEN NEW SOFTWARE\nLICENSES REVENUES AND\/OR HARDWARE SYSTEMS PRODUCTS REVENUES, INCLUDING THE COSTS OF HARDWARE SYSTEMS PRODUCTS, ARE GENERALLY RECOGNIZED TOGETHER WITH THE SERVICES BASED ON CONTRACT ACCOUNTING USING EITHER THE PERCENTAGE-OF-COMPLETION OR\nCOMPLETED-CONTRACT METHOD. CONTRACT ACCOUNTING IS APPLIED TO ANY BUNDLED SOFTWARE, HARDWARE SYSTEMS AND SERVICES ARRANGEMENTS: (1) THAT INCLUDE MILESTONES OR CUSTOMER SPECIFIC ACCEPTANCE CRITERIA THAT MAY AFFECT COLLECTION OF THE SOFTWARE\nLICENSE OR HARDWARE SYSTEMS PRODUCT FEES; (2) WHERE CONSULTING SERVICES INCLUDE SIGNIFICANT MODIFICATION OR CUSTOMIZATION OF THE SOFTWARE OR HARDWARE SYSTEMS PRODUCT OR ARE OF A SPECIALIZED NATURE AND GENERALLY PERFORMED ONLY BY ORACLE;\n(3) WHERE SIGNIFICANT CONSULTING SERVICES ARE PROVIDED FOR IN THE SOFTWARE LICENSE CONTRACT OR HARDWARE SYSTEMS PRODUCT CONTRACT WITHOUT ADDITIONAL CHARGE OR ARE SUBSTANTIALLY DISCOUNTED; OR (4) WHERE THE SOFTWARE LICENSE OR HARDWARE\nSYSTEMS PRODUCT PAYMENT IS TIED TO THE PERFORMANCE OF CONSULTING SERVICES. FOR THE PURPOSES OF REVENUE CLASSIFICATION OF THE ELEMENTS THAT ARE ACCOUNTED FOR AS A SINGLE UNIT OF ACCOUNTING, WE ALLOCATE REVENUES TO SOFTWARE AND NONSOFTWARE ELEMENTS\nBASED ON A RATIONAL AND CONSISTENT METHODOLOGY UTILIZING OUR BEST ESTIMATE OF THE RELATIVE SELLING PRICE OF SUCH ELEMENTS.\nWE ALSO EVALUATE\nARRANGEMENTS WITH GOVERNMENTAL ENTITIES CONTAINING \u0093FISCAL FUNDING\u0094 OR \u0093TERMINATION FOR CONVENIENCE\u0094 PROVISIONS, WHEN SUCH PROVISIONS ARE REQUIRED BY LAW, TO DETERMINE THE PROBABILITY OF POSSIBLE CANCELLATION. WE CONSIDER\nMULTIPLE FACTORS, INCLUDING THE HISTORY WITH THE CUSTOMER IN SIMILAR TRANSACTIONS, THE \u0093ESSENTIAL USE\u0094 OF THE SOFTWARE OR HARDWARE SYSTEMS PRODUCTS AND THE PLANNING, BUDGETING AND APPROVAL PROCESSES UNDERTAKEN BY THE GOVERNMENTAL ENTITY.\nIF WE DETERMINE UPON EXECUTION OF THESE ARRANGEMENTS THAT THE LIKELIHOOD OF CANCELLATION IS REMOTE, WE THEN RECOGNIZE REVENUES ONCE ALL OF THE CRITERIA DESCRIBED ABOVE HAVE BEEN MET. IF SUCH A DETERMINATION CANNOT BE MADE, REVENUES ARE RECOGNIZED\nUPON THE EARLIER OF CASH RECEIPT OR APPROVAL OF THE APPLICABLE FUNDING PROVISION BY THE GOVERNMENTAL ENTITY.\nWE ASSESS WHETHER FEES ARE FIXED\nOR DETERMINABLE AT THE TIME OF SALE AND RECOGNIZE REVENUES IF ALL OTHER REVENUE RECOGNITION REQUIREMENTS ARE MET. OUR STANDARD PAYMENT TERMS ARE NET 30 DAYS. HOWEVER, PAYMENT TERMS MAY VARY BASED ON THE COUNTRY IN WHICH THE AGREEMENT IS EXECUTED.\nPAYMENTS THAT ARE DUE WITHIN SIX MONTHS ARE GENERALLY DEEMED TO BE FIXED OR DETERMINABLE BASED ON OUR SUCCESSFUL COLLECTION HISTORY ON SUCH ARRANGEMENTS, AND THEREBY SATISFY THE REQUIRED CRITERIA FOR REVENUE RECOGNITION.\nWHILE MOST OF OUR ARRANGEMENTS FOR SALES WITHIN OUR BUSINESSES INCLUDE SHORT-TERM PAYMENT TERMS, WE HAVE A STANDARD PRACTICE OF PROVIDING LONG-TERM\nFINANCING TO CREDITWORTHY CUSTOMERS PRIMARILY THROUGH OUR FINANCING DIVISION. SINCE FISCAL 1989, WHEN OUR FINANCING DIVISION WAS FORMED, WE HAVE ESTABLISHED A HISTORY OF COLLECTION, WITHOUT CONCESSIONS, ON THESE RECEIVABLES WITH PAYMENT TERMS THAT\nGENERALLY EXTEND UP TO FIVE YEARS FROM THE CONTRACT DATE. PROVIDED ALL OTHER REVENUE RECOGNITION CRITERIA HAVE BEEN MET, WE RECOGNIZE NEW SOFTWARE LICENSES REVENUES AND HARDWARE SYSTEMS PRODUCTS REVENUES FOR THESE ARRANGEMENTS UPON DELIVERY, NET OF\nANY PAYMENT DISCOUNTS FROM FINANCING TRANSACTIONS. WE HAVE GENERALLY SOLD RECEIVABLES FINANCED THROUGH OUR FINANCING DIVISION ON A NON-RECOURSE BASIS TO THIRD PARTY FINANCING INSTITUTIONS WITHIN 90 DAYS OF THE CONTRACTS\u0092 DATES OF EXECUTION AND\nWE CLASSIFY THE\n41\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nPROCEEDS FROM THESE SALES AS CASH FLOWS FROM OPERATING ACTIVITIES IN OUR CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF CASH FLOWS. WE ACCOUNT FOR THE SALES OF THESE RECEIVABLES AS \u0093TRUE SALES\u0094 AS DEFINED\nIN ASC 860,\nTRANSFERS AND SERVICING\n, AS WE ARE CONSIDERED TO HAVE SURRENDERED CONTROL OF THESE FINANCING RECEIVABLES.\nIN ADDITION, WE\nENTER INTO ARRANGEMENTS WITH LEASING COMPANIES FOR THE SALE OF OUR HARDWARE SYSTEMS PRODUCTS. THESE LEASING COMPANIES, IN TURN, LEASE OUR PRODUCTS TO END-USERS. THE LEASING COMPANIES GENERALLY HAVE NO RECOURSE TO US IN THE EVENT OF DEFAULT BY THE\nEND-USER AND WE RECOGNIZE REVENUE UPON DELIVERY, IF ALL THE OTHER REVENUE RECOGNITION CRITERIA HAVE BEEN MET.\nOUR CUSTOMERS INCLUDE SEVERAL OF\nOUR SUPPLIERS AND OCCASIONALLY, WE HAVE PURCHASED GOODS OR SERVICES FOR OUR OPERATIONS FROM THESE VENDORS AT OR ABOUT THE SAME TIME THAT WE HAVE SOLD OUR PRODUCTS TO THESE SAME COMPANIES (CONCURRENT TRANSACTIONS). SOFTWARE LICENSE AGREEMENTS OR\nSALES OF HARDWARE SYSTEMS THAT OCCUR WITHIN A THREE-MONTH TIME PERIOD FROM THE DATE WE HAVE PURCHASED GOODS OR SERVICES FROM THAT SAME CUSTOMER ARE REVIEWED FOR APPROPRIATE ACCOUNTING TREATMENT AND DISCLOSURE. WHEN WE ACQUIRE GOODS OR SERVICES FROM\nA CUSTOMER, WE NEGOTIATE THE PURCHASE SEPARATELY FROM ANY SALES TRANSACTION, AT TERMS WE CONSIDER TO BE AT ARM\u0092S LENGTH AND SETTLE THE PURCHASE IN CASH. WE RECOGNIZE NEW SOFTWARE LICENSES REVENUES OR HARDWARE SYSTEMS PRODUCT REVENUES FROM\nCONCURRENT TRANSACTIONS IF ALL OF OUR REVENUE RECOGNITION CRITERIA ARE MET AND THE GOODS AND SERVICES ACQUIRED ARE NECESSARY FOR OUR CURRENT OPERATIONS.\nBUSINESS COMBINATIONS\nWE APPLY THE PROVISIONS OF ASC 805,\nBUSINESS\nCOMBINATIONS\n, IN THE ACCOUNTING FOR OUR ACQUISITIONS. IT REQUIRES US TO RECOGNIZE SEPARATELY FROM GOODWILL THE ASSETS ACQUIRED AND THE LIABILITIES ASSUMED AT THEIR ACQUISITION DATE FAIR VALUES. GOODWILL AS OF THE ACQUISITION DATE IS MEASURED AS\nTHE EXCESS OF CONSIDERATION TRANSFERRED OVER THE NET OF THE ACQUISITION DATE FAIR VALUES OF THE ASSETS ACQUIRED AND THE LIABILITIES ASSUMED. WHILE WE USE OUR BEST ESTIMATES AND ASSUMPTIONS TO ACCURATELY VALUE ASSETS ACQUIRED AND LIABILITIES ASSUMED\nAT THE ACQUISITION DATE AS WELL AS CONTINGENT CONSIDERATION, WHERE APPLICABLE, OUR ESTIMATES ARE INHERENTLY UNCERTAIN AND SUBJECT TO REFINEMENT. AS A RESULT, DURING THE MEASUREMENT PERIOD, WHICH MAY BE UP TO ONE YEAR FROM THE ACQUISITION DATE, WE\nRECORD ADJUSTMENTS TO THE ASSETS ACQUIRED AND LIABILITIES ASSUMED WITH THE CORRESPONDING OFFSET TO GOODWILL. UPON THE CONCLUSION OF THE MEASUREMENT PERIOD OR FINAL DETERMINATION OF THE VALUES OF ASSETS ACQUIRED OR LIABILITIES ASSUMED, WHICHEVER\nCOMES FIRST, ANY SUBSEQUENT ADJUSTMENTS ARE RECORDED TO OUR CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF OPERATIONS.\nACCOUNTING FOR BUSINESS COMBINATIONS\nREQUIRES OUR MANAGEMENT TO MAKE SIGNIFICANT ESTIMATES AND ASSUMPTIONS, ESPECIALLY AT THE ACQUISITION DATE INCLUDING OUR ESTIMATES FOR INTANGIBLE ASSETS, CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS ASSUMED, RESTRUCTURING LIABILITIES, PRE-ACQUISITION CONTINGENCIES AND\nCONTINGENT CONSIDERATION, WHERE APPLICABLE. ALTHOUGH WE BELIEVE THE ASSUMPTIONS AND ESTIMATES WE HAVE MADE IN THE PAST HAVE BEEN REASONABLE AND APPROPRIATE, THEY ARE BASED IN PART ON HISTORICAL EXPERIENCE AND INFORMATION OBTAINED FROM THE MANAGEMENT\nOF THE ACQUIRED COMPANIES AND ARE INHERENTLY UNCERTAIN.\nEXAMPLES OF CRITICAL ESTIMATES IN VALUING CERTAIN OF THE INTANGIBLE ASSETS WE HAVE\nACQUIRED INCLUDE BUT ARE NOT LIMITED TO.\n\u0095\nFUTURE EXPECTED CASH FLOWS FROM SOFTWARE LICENSE SALES, CLOUD SOFTWARE SUBSCRIPTIONS CONTRACTS, HARDWARE SYSTEMS PRODUCT SALES, SUPPORT AGREEMENTS,\nCONSULTING CONTRACTS, OTHER CUSTOMER CONTRACTS, ACQUIRED DEVELOPED TECHNOLOGIES AND PATENTS;\n\u0095\nEXPECTED COSTS TO DEVELOP THE IN-PROCESS RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT INTO COMMERCIALLY VIABLE PRODUCTS AND ESTIMATED CASH FLOWS FROM THE PROJECTS WHEN\nCOMPLETED;\n\u0095\nTHE ACQUIRED COMPANY\u0092S BRAND AND COMPETITIVE POSITION, AS WELL AS ASSUMPTIONS ABOUT THE PERIOD OF TIME THE ACQUIRED BRAND WILL CONTINUE TO BE USED\nIN THE COMBINED COMPANY\u0092S PRODUCT PORTFOLIO; AND\n\u0095\nDISCOUNT RATES.\nUNANTICIPATED EVENTS AND CIRCUMSTANCES MAY OCCUR THAT MAY AFFECT THE ACCURACY OR VALIDITY OF SUCH ASSUMPTIONS, ESTIMATES OR ACTUAL RESULTS.\nWE ESTIMATE THE FAIR VALUES OF CLOUD SOFTWARE SUBSCRIPTIONS, SOFTWARE LICENSE UPDATES AND PRODUCT SUPPORT AND HARDWARE SYSTEMS SUPPORT OBLIGATIONS\nASSUMED. THE ESTIMATED FAIR VALUES OF THESE PERFORMANCE OBLIGATIONS ARE DETERMINED UTILIZING A COST BUILD-UP APPROACH. THE COST BUILD-UP APPROACH DETERMINES FAIR VALUE BY ESTIMATING THE COSTS RELATED TO FULFILLING THE OBLIGATIONS PLUS A NORMAL\nPROFIT MARGIN. THE ESTIMATED COSTS TO FULFILL THE OBLIGATIONS ARE BASED ON THE HISTORICAL DIRECT COSTS RELATED TO PROVIDING THE SERVICES INCLUDING THE CORRECTION OF ANY ERRORS IN THE PRODUCTS ACQUIRED. THE SUM OF THESE COSTS AND OPERATING PROFIT\nAPPROXIMATES, IN THEORY, THE AMOUNT THAT WE WOULD BE REQUIRED TO PAY A THIRD PARTY TO ASSUME THE PERFORMANCE OBLIGATIONS. WE DO NOT INCLUDE ANY COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH SELLING EFFORTS OR RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT OR THE RELATED FULFILLMENT MARGINS ON\nTHESE COSTS. PROFIT ASSOCIATED\n42\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nWITH ANY SELLING EFFORTS IS EXCLUDED BECAUSE THE ACQUIRED ENTITIES WOULD HAVE CONCLUDED THOSE SELLING EFFORTS ON THE PERFORMANCE OBLIGATIONS PRIOR TO THE ACQUISITION DATE. WE ALSO DO NOT INCLUDE\nTHE ESTIMATED RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT COSTS IN OUR FAIR VALUE DETERMINATIONS, AS THESE COSTS ARE NOT DEEMED TO REPRESENT A LEGAL OBLIGATION AT THE TIME OF ACQUISITION. AS A RESULT, WE DID NOT RECOGNIZE CLOUD SOFTWARE SUBSCRIPTIONS REVENUES RELATED\nTO CLOUD SOFTWARE SUBSCRIPTIONS CONTRACTS IN THE AMOUNT OF $45 MILLION AND $22 MILLION THAT WOULD HAVE BEEN OTHERWISE RECORDED BY THE ACQUIRED BUSINESSES AS INDEPENDENT ENTITIES IN FISCAL 2013 AND 2012, RESPECTIVELY. WE DID NOT RECOGNIZE SOFTWARE\nLICENSE UPDATES AND PRODUCT SUPPORT REVENUES RELATED TO SUPPORT CONTRACTS IN THE AMOUNTS OF $14 MILLION, $48 MILLION AND $80 MILLION THAT WOULD HAVE BEEN OTHERWISE RECORDED BY THE ACQUIRED BUSINESSES AS INDEPENDENT ENTITIES IN FISCAL 2013, 2012 AND\n2011, RESPECTIVELY. IN ADDITION, WE DID NOT RECOGNIZE HARDWARE SYSTEMS SUPPORT REVENUES RELATED TO HARDWARE SYSTEMS SUPPORT CONTRACTS THAT WOULD HAVE OTHERWISE BEEN RECORDED BY THE ACQUIRED BUSINESSES AS INDEPENDENT ENTITIES IN THE AMOUNTS OF $14\nMILLION, $30 MILLION AND $148 MILLION FOR FISCAL 2013, 2012 AND 2011, RESPECTIVELY. HISTORICALLY, SUBSTANTIALLY ALL OF OUR CUSTOMERS, INCLUDING CUSTOMERS FROM ACQUIRED COMPANIES, RENEW THEIR SOFTWARE LICENSE UPDATES AND PRODUCT SUPPORT CONTRACTS\nWHEN THE CONTRACTS ARE ELIGIBLE FOR RENEWAL AND WE STRIVE TO RENEW CLOUD SOFTWARE SUBSCRIPTIONS AND HARDWARE SYSTEMS SUPPORT CONTRACTS. TO THE EXTENT CLOUD SOFTWARE SUBSCRIPTIONS, SOFTWARE SUPPORT OR HARDWARE SYSTEMS SUPPORT CONTRACTS ARE RENEWED,\nWE WILL RECOGNIZE THE REVENUES FOR THE FULL VALUES OF THE CONTRACTS OVER THE CONTRACTS\u0092 PERIODS, WHICH ARE GENERALLY ONE YEAR IN DURATION.\nIN CONNECTION WITH A BUSINESS COMBINATION OR OTHER STRATEGIC INITIATIVE, WE MAY ESTIMATE COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH RESTRUCTURING PLANS COMMITTED TO BY OUR\nMANAGEMENT. RESTRUCTURING COSTS ARE TYPICALLY COMPRISED OF EMPLOYEE SEVERANCE COSTS, COSTS OF CONSOLIDATING DUPLICATE FACILITIES AND CONTRACT TERMINATION COSTS. RESTRUCTURING EXPENSES ARE BASED UPON PLANS THAT HAVE BEEN COMMITTED TO BY OUR\nMANAGEMENT, BUT MAY BE REFINED IN SUBSEQUENT PERIODS. WE ACCOUNT FOR COSTS TO EXIT OR RESTRUCTURE CERTAIN ACTIVITIES OF AN ACQUIRED COMPANY SEPARATELY FROM THE BUSINESS COMBINATION PURSUANT TO ASC 420,\nEXIT OR DISPOSAL COST OBLIGATIONS.\nA\nLIABILITY FOR COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH AN EXIT OR DISPOSAL ACTIVITY IS RECOGNIZED AND MEASURED AT ITS FAIR VALUE IN OUR CONSOLIDATED STATEMENT OF OPERATIONS IN THE PERIOD IN WHICH THE LIABILITY IS INCURRED. WHEN ESTIMATING THE FAIR VALUE OF FACILITY\nRESTRUCTURING ACTIVITIES, ASSUMPTIONS ARE APPLIED REGARDING ESTIMATED SUB-LEASE PAYMENTS TO BE RECEIVED, WHICH CAN DIFFER MATERIALLY FROM ACTUAL RESULTS. THIS MAY REQUIRE US TO REVISE OUR INITIAL ESTIMATES WHICH MAY MATERIALLY AFFECT OUR RESULTS OF\nOPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL POSITION IN THE PERIOD THE REVISION IS MADE.\nFOR A GIVEN ACQUISITION, WE MAY IDENTIFY CERTAIN PRE-ACQUISITION\nCONTINGENCIES AS OF THE ACQUISITION DATE AND MAY EXTEND OUR REVIEW AND EVALUATION OF THESE PRE-ACQUISITION CONTINGENCIES THROUGHOUT THE MEASUREMENT PERIOD IN ORDER TO OBTAIN SUFFICIENT INFORMATION TO ASSESS WHETHER WE INCLUDE THESE CONTINGENCIES AS\nA PART OF THE FAIR VALUE ESTIMATES OF ASSETS ACQUIRED AND LIABILITIES ASSUMED AND, IF SO, TO DETERMINE THEIR ESTIMATED AMOUNTS.\nIF WE CANNOT\nREASONABLY DETERMINE THE FAIR VALUE OF A PRE-ACQUISITION CONTINGENCY (NON-INCOME TAX RELATED) BY THE END OF THE MEASUREMENT PERIOD, WHICH IS GENERALLY THE CASE GIVEN THE NATURE OF SUCH MATTERS, WE WILL RECOGNIZE AN ASSET OR A LIABILITY FOR SUCH\nPRE-ACQUISITION CONTINGENCY IF: (I) IT IS PROBABLE THAT AN ASSET EXISTED OR A LIABILITY HAD BEEN INCURRED AT THE ACQUISITION DATE AND (II) THE AMOUNT OF THE ASSET OR LIABILITY CAN BE REASONABLY ESTIMATED. SUBSEQUENT TO THE MEASUREMENT\nPERIOD, CHANGES IN OUR ESTIMATES OF SUCH CONTINGENCIES WILL AFFECT EARNINGS AND COULD HAVE A MATERIAL EFFECT ON OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL POSITION.\nIN ADDITION, UNCERTAIN TAX POSITIONS AND TAX RELATED VALUATION ALLOWANCES ASSUMED IN CONNECTION WITH A BUSINESS COMBINATION ARE INITIALLY ESTIMATED AS OF THE ACQUISITION DATE. WE REEVALUATE THESE ITEMS\nQUARTERLY BASED UPON FACTS AND CIRCUMSTANCES THAT EXISTED AS OF THE ACQUISITION DATE WITH ANY ADJUSTMENTS TO OUR PRELIMINARY ESTIMATES BEING RECORDED TO GOODWILL IF IDENTIFIED WITHIN THE MEASUREMENT PERIOD. SUBSEQUENT TO THE MEASUREMENT PERIOD OR\nOUR FINAL DETERMINATION OF THE TAX ALLOWANCE\u0092S OR CONTINGENCY\u0092S ESTIMATED VALUE, WHICHEVER COMES FIRST, CHANGES TO THESE UNCERTAIN TAX POSITIONS AND TAX RELATED VALUATION ALLOWANCES WILL AFFECT OUR PROVISION FOR INCOME TAXES IN OUR\nCONSOLIDATED STATEMENT OF OPERATIONS AND COULD HAVE A MATERIAL IMPACT ON OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL POSITION.\nGOODWILL AND\nINTANGIBLE ASSETS\u0097IMPAIRMENT ASSESSMENTS\nWE REVIEW GOODWILL FOR IMPAIRMENT ANNUALLY AND WHENEVER EVENTS OR CHANGES IN\nCIRCUMSTANCES INDICATE ITS CARRYING VALUE MAY NOT BE RECOVERABLE IN ACCORDANCE WITH ASC 350,\nINTANGIBLES\u0097GOODWILL AND OTHER\n. EFFECTIVE FISCAL 2012, WE OPTED TO PERFORM A QUALITATIVE ASSESSMENT TO TEST A REPORTING UNIT\u0092S GOODWILL FOR\nIMPAIRMENT. BASED ON OUR QUALITATIVE ASSESSMENT, IF WE DETERMINE THAT THE FAIR VALUE OF A REPORTING UNIT IS MORE LIKELY THAN NOT (I.E. A LIKELIHOOD OF MORE THAN 50 PERCENT) TO BE LESS THAN ITS CARRYING AMOUNT, THE TWO STEP IMPAIRMENT TEST WILL BE\nPERFORMED. IN THE FIRST STEP, WE COMPARE THE FAIR VALUE OF EACH REPORTING UNIT TO ITS CARRYING VALUE. IF THE FAIR VALUE OF THE REPORTING UNIT EXCEEDS THE CARRYING VALUE OF THE NET ASSETS ASSIGNED TO THAT UNIT, GOODWILL IS NOT CONSIDERED IMPAIRED AND\nWE ARE NOT REQUIRED TO PERFORM FURTHER TESTING. IF THE CARRYING VALUE OF THE NET ASSETS ASSIGNED TO THE\n43\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nREPORTING UNIT EXCEEDS THE FAIR VALUE OF THE REPORTING UNIT, THEN WE MUST PERFORM THE SECOND STEP OF THE IMPAIRMENT TEST IN ORDER TO DETERMINE THE IMPLIED FAIR VALUE OF THE REPORTING UNIT\u0092S\nGOODWILL. IF THE CARRYING VALUE OF A REPORTING UNIT\u0092S GOODWILL EXCEEDS ITS IMPLIED FAIR VALUE, THEN WE WOULD RECORD AN IMPAIRMENT LOSS EQUAL TO THE DIFFERENCE.\nDETERMINING THE FAIR VALUE OF A REPORTING UNIT INVOLVES THE USE OF SIGNIFICANT ESTIMATES AND ASSUMPTIONS. THESE ESTIMATES AND ASSUMPTIONS INCLUDE REVENUE GROWTH RATES AND OPERATING MARGINS USED TO\nCALCULATE PROJECTED FUTURE CASH FLOWS, RISK-ADJUSTED DISCOUNT RATES, FUTURE ECONOMIC AND MARKET CONDITIONS AND DETERMINATION OF APPROPRIATE MARKET COMPARABLES. WE BASE OUR FAIR VALUE ESTIMATES ON ASSUMPTIONS WE BELIEVE TO BE REASONABLE BUT THAT ARE\nUNPREDICTABLE AND INHERENTLY UNCERTAIN. ACTUAL FUTURE RESULTS MAY DIFFER FROM THOSE ESTIMATES. IN ADDITION, WE MAKE CERTAIN JUDGMENTS AND ASSUMPTIONS IN ALLOCATING SHARED ASSETS AND LIABILITIES TO DETERMINE THE CARRYING VALUES FOR EACH OF OUR\nREPORTING UNITS. OUR MOST RECENT ANNUAL GOODWILL IMPAIRMENT ANALYSIS, WHICH WAS PERFORMED ON MARCH 1, 2013, DID NOT RESULT IN A GOODWILL IMPAIRMENT CHARGE, NOR DID WE RECORD ANY GOODWILL IMPAIRMENT IN FISCAL 2012 OR 2011. OUR CONSULTING AND\nHARDWARE SYSTEMS PRODUCTS REPORTING UNITS HAVE EXPERIENCED REVENUES AND OPERATING MARGIN DECLINES IN FISCAL 2013 AS COMPARED TO PRIOR YEARS. AS A RESULT, OUR CONSULTING AND HARDWARE SYSTEMS PRODUCTS REPORTING UNITS MAY BE AT GREATER RISK FOR\nGOODWILL IMPAIRMENT THAN OUR OTHER REPORTING UNITS IF OUR ACTUAL RESULTS FOR THESE REPORTING UNITS DIFFER FROM OUR PROJECTIONS.\nWE MAKE\nJUDGMENTS ABOUT THE RECOVERABILITY OF PURCHASED FINITE LIVED INTANGIBLE ASSETS WHENEVER EVENTS OR CHANGES IN CIRCUMSTANCES INDICATE THAT AN IMPAIRMENT MAY EXIST. EACH PERIOD WE EVALUATE THE ESTIMATED REMAINING USEFUL LIVES OF PURCHASED INTANGIBLE\nASSETS AND WHETHER EVENTS OR CHANGES IN CIRCUMSTANCES WARRANT A REVISION TO THE REMAINING PERIODS OF AMORTIZATION. RECOVERABILITY OF FINITE LIVED INTANGIBLE ASSETS IS MEASURED BY COMPARISON OF THE CARRYING AMOUNT OF THE ASSET TO THE FUTURE\nUNDISCOUNTED CASH FLOWS THE ASSET IS EXPECTED TO GENERATE. WE REVIEW INDEFINITE LIVED INTANGIBLE ASSETS FOR IMPAIRMENT ANNUALLY AND WHENEVER EVENTS OR CHANGES IN CIRCUMSTANCES INDICATE THE CARRYING VALUE MAY NOT BE RECOVERABLE. RECOVERABILITY OF\nINDEFINITE LIVED INTANGIBLE ASSETS IS MEASURED BY COMPARISON OF THE CARRYING AMOUNT OF THE ASSET TO ITS FAIR VALUE. IF THE ASSET IS CONSIDERED TO BE IMPAIRED, THE AMOUNT OF ANY IMPAIRMENT IS MEASURED AS THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE CARRYING VALUE AND\nTHE FAIR VALUE OF THE IMPAIRED ASSET.\nASSUMPTIONS AND ESTIMATES ABOUT FUTURE VALUES AND REMAINING USEFUL LIVES OF OUR INTANGIBLE AND OTHER\nLONG-LIVED ASSETS ARE COMPLEX AND SUBJECTIVE. THEY CAN BE AFFECTED BY A VARIETY OF FACTORS, INCLUDING EXTERNAL FACTORS SUCH AS INDUSTRY AND ECONOMIC TRENDS AND INTERNAL FACTORS SUCH AS CHANGES IN OUR BUSINESS STRATEGY AND OUR INTERNAL FORECASTS.\nALTHOUGH WE BELIEVE THE HISTORICAL ASSUMPTIONS AND ESTIMATES WE HAVE MADE ARE REASONABLE AND APPROPRIATE, DIFFERENT ASSUMPTIONS AND ESTIMATES COULD MATERIALLY IMPACT OUR REPORTED FINANCIAL RESULTS. WE DID NOT RECOGNIZE ANY INTANGIBLE ASSET\nIMPAIRMENT CHARGES IN FISCAL 2013, 2012 OR 2011.\nACCOUNTING FOR INCOME TAXES\nSIGNIFICANT JUDGMENT IS REQUIRED IN DETERMINING OUR WORLDWIDE INCOME TAX PROVISION. IN THE ORDINARY COURSE OF A GLOBAL BUSINESS, THERE ARE MANY\nTRANSACTIONS AND CALCULATIONS WHERE THE ULTIMATE TAX OUTCOME IS UNCERTAIN. SOME OF THESE UNCERTAINTIES ARISE AS A CONSEQUENCE OF REVENUE SHARING AND COST REIMBURSEMENT ARRANGEMENTS AMONG RELATED ENTITIES, THE PROCESS OF IDENTIFYING ITEMS OF REVENUES\nAND EXPENSES THAT QUALIFY FOR PREFERENTIAL TAX TREATMENT AND SEGREGATION OF FOREIGN AND DOMESTIC EARNINGS AND EXPENSES TO AVOID DOUBLE TAXATION. ALTHOUGH WE BELIEVE THAT OUR ESTIMATES ARE REASONABLE, THE FINAL TAX OUTCOME OF THESE MATTERS COULD BE\nDIFFERENT FROM THAT WHICH IS REFLECTED IN OUR HISTORICAL INCOME TAX PROVISIONS AND ACCRUALS. SUCH DIFFERENCES COULD HAVE A MATERIAL EFFECT ON OUR INCOME TAX PROVISION AND NET INCOME IN THE PERIOD IN WHICH SUCH DETERMINATION IS MADE.\nOUR EFFECTIVE TAX RATE INCLUDES THE IMPACT OF CERTAIN UNDISTRIBUTED FOREIGN EARNINGS FOR WHICH NO U.S. TAXES HAVE BEEN PROVIDED BECAUSE SUCH EARNINGS ARE\nPLANNED TO BE INDEFINITELY REINVESTED OUTSIDE THE UNITED STATES. REMITTANCES OF FOREIGN EARNINGS TO THE UNITED STATES ARE PLANNED BASED ON PROJECTED CASH FLOW, WORKING CAPITAL AND INVESTMENT NEEDS OF OUR FOREIGN AND DOMESTIC OPERATIONS. BASED ON\nTHESE ASSUMPTIONS, WE ESTIMATE THE AMOUNT THAT WILL BE DISTRIBUTED TO THE UNITED STATES AND PROVIDE U.S. FEDERAL TAXES ON THESE AMOUNTS. MATERIAL CHANGES IN OUR ESTIMATES AS TO HOW MUCH OF OUR FOREIGN EARNINGS WILL BE DISTRIBUTED TO THE UNITED\nSTATES OR TAX LEGISLATION THAT LIMITS OR RESTRICTS THE AMOUNT OF UNDISTRIBUTED FOREIGN EARNINGS THAT WE CONSIDER INDEFINITELY REINVESTED OUTSIDE THE UNITED STATES COULD MATERIALLY IMPACT OUR INCOME TAX PROVISION AND EFFECTIVE TAX RATE.\nWE RECORD A VALUATION ALLOWANCE TO REDUCE OUR DEFERRED TAX ASSETS TO THE AMOUNT THAT IS MORE LIKELY THAN NOT TO BE REALIZED. IN ORDER FOR US TO REALIZE\nOUR DEFERRED TAX ASSETS, WE MUST BE ABLE TO GENERATE SUFFICIENT TAXABLE INCOME IN THOSE JURISDICTIONS WHERE THE DEFERRED TAX ASSETS ARE LOCATED. WE CONSIDER FUTURE GROWTH, FORECASTED EARNINGS, FUTURE TAXABLE INCOME, THE MIX OF EARNINGS IN THE\nJURISDICTIONS IN WHICH WE OPERATE, HISTORICAL EARNINGS, TAXABLE INCOME IN PRIOR YEARS, IF CARRYBACK IS PERMITTED UNDER THE LAW AND PRUDENT AND FEASIBLE TAX PLANNING STRATEGIES IN DETERMINING THE NEED FOR A VALUATION ALLOWANCE. IN THE EVENT WE WERE\nTO DETERMINE THAT WE WOULD NOT BE ABLE TO REALIZE ALL OR PART OF OUR NET DEFERRED TAX ASSETS IN THE FUTURE, AN ADJUSTMENT TO THE DEFERRED TAX ASSETS VALUATION ALLOWANCE WOULD BE CHARGED TO EARNINGS IN THE PERIOD IN WHICH WE MAKE SUCH A\nDETERMINATION, OR GOODWILL WOULD BE\n44\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nADJUSTED AT OUR FINAL DETERMINATION OF THE VALUATION ALLOWANCE RELATED TO AN ACQUISITION WITHIN THE MEASUREMENT PERIOD. IF WE LATER DETERMINE THAT IT IS MORE LIKELY THAN NOT THAT THE NET DEFERRED\nTAX ASSETS WOULD BE REALIZED, WE WOULD REVERSE THE APPLICABLE PORTION OF THE PREVIOUSLY PROVIDED VALUATION ALLOWANCE AS AN ADJUSTMENT TO EARNINGS AT SUCH TIME.\nWE CALCULATE OUR CURRENT AND DEFERRED TAX PROVISION BASED ON ESTIMATES AND ASSUMPTIONS THAT COULD DIFFER FROM THE ACTUAL RESULTS REFLECTED IN INCOME TAX RETURNS FILED DURING THE SUBSEQUENT YEAR.\nADJUSTMENTS BASED ON FILED RETURNS ARE GENERALLY RECORDED IN THE PERIOD WHEN THE TAX RETURNS ARE FILED AND THE GLOBAL TAX IMPLICATIONS ARE KNOWN, WHICH CAN MATERIALLY IMPACT OUR EFFECTIVE TAX RATE.\nTHE AMOUNT OF INCOME TAX WE PAY IS SUBJECT TO ONGOING AUDITS BY FEDERAL, STATE AND FOREIGN TAX AUTHORITIES, WHICH OFTEN RESULT IN PROPOSED ASSESSMENTS.\nOUR ESTIMATE OF THE POTENTIAL OUTCOME FOR ANY UNCERTAIN TAX ISSUE IS HIGHLY JUDGMENTAL. A DESCRIPTION OF OUR ACCOUNTING POLICIES ASSOCIATED WITH TAX RELATED CONTINGENCIES ASSUMED AS A PART OF A BUSINESS COMBINATION IS PROVIDED UNDER \u0093BUSINESS\nCOMBINATIONS\u0094 ABOVE. FOR THOSE TAX RELATED CONTINGENCIES THAT ARE NOT A PART OF A BUSINESS COMBINATION, WE ACCOUNT FOR THESE UNCERTAIN TAX ISSUES PURSUANT TO ASC 740,\nINCOME TAXES\n, WHICH CONTAINS A TWO-STEP APPROACH TO RECOGNIZING AND\nMEASURING UNCERTAIN TAX POSITIONS TAKEN OR EXPECTED TO BE TAKEN IN A TAX RETURN. THE FIRST STEP IS TO DETERMINE IF THE WEIGHT OF AVAILABLE EVIDENCE INDICATES THAT IT IS MORE LIKELY THAN NOT THAT THE TAX POSITION WILL BE SUSTAINED IN AN AUDIT,\nINCLUDING RESOLUTION OF ANY RELATED APPEALS OR LITIGATION PROCESSES. THE SECOND STEP IS TO MEASURE THE TAX BENEFIT AS THE LARGEST AMOUNT THAT IS MORE THAN 50% LIKELY TO BE REALIZED UPON ULTIMATE SETTLEMENT. ALTHOUGH WE BELIEVE WE HAVE ADEQUATELY\nRESERVED FOR OUR UNCERTAIN TAX POSITIONS, NO ASSURANCE CAN BE GIVEN WITH RESPECT TO THE FINAL OUTCOME OF THESE MATTERS. WE ADJUST RESERVES FOR OUR UNCERTAIN TAX POSITIONS DUE TO CHANGING FACTS AND CIRCUMSTANCES, SUCH AS THE CLOSING OF A TAX AUDIT,\nJUDICIAL RULINGS, REFINEMENT OF ESTIMATES OR REALIZATION OF EARNINGS OR DEDUCTIONS THAT DIFFER FROM OUR ESTIMATES. TO THE EXTENT THAT THE FINAL OUTCOME OF THESE MATTERS IS DIFFERENT THAN THE AMOUNTS RECORDED, SUCH DIFFERENCES GENERALLY WILL IMPACT\nOUR PROVISION FOR INCOME TAXES IN THE PERIOD IN WHICH SUCH A DETERMINATION IS MADE. OUR PROVISIONS FOR INCOME TAXES INCLUDE THE IMPACT OF RESERVE PROVISIONS AND CHANGES TO RESERVES THAT ARE CONSIDERED APPROPRIATE AND ALSO INCLUDE THE RELATED\nINTEREST AND PENALTIES.\nIN ADDITION, AS A PART OF OUR ACCOUNTING FOR BUSINESS COMBINATIONS, INTANGIBLE ASSETS ARE RECOGNIZED AT FAIR VALUES\nAND GOODWILL IS MEASURED AS THE EXCESS OF CONSIDERATION TRANSFERRED OVER THE NET ESTIMATED FAIR VALUES OF ASSETS ACQUIRED. IMPAIRMENT CHARGES ASSOCIATED WITH GOODWILL ARE GENERALLY NOT TAX DEDUCTIBLE AND WILL RESULT IN AN INCREASED EFFECTIVE INCOME\nTAX RATE IN THE PERIOD THAT ANY IMPAIRMENT IS RECORDED. AMORTIZATION EXPENSES ASSOCIATED WITH ACQUIRED INTANGIBLE ASSETS ARE GENERALLY NOT TAX DEDUCTIBLE PURSUANT TO OUR EXISTING TAX STRUCTURE; HOWEVER, DEFERRED TAXES HAVE BEEN RECORDED FOR\nNON-DEDUCTIBLE AMORTIZATION EXPENSES AS A PART OF THE ACCOUNTING FOR BUSINESS COMBINATIONS. WE HAVE TAKEN INTO ACCOUNT THE ALLOCATION OF THESE IDENTIFIED INTANGIBLES AMONG DIFFERENT TAXING JURISDICTIONS, INCLUDING THOSE WITH NOMINAL OR ZERO PERCENT\nTAX RATES, IN ESTABLISHING THE RELATED DEFERRED TAX LIABILITIES.\nLEGAL AND OTHER CONTINGENCIES\nWE ARE CURRENTLY INVOLVED IN VARIOUS CLAIMS AND LEGAL PROCEEDINGS. QUARTERLY, WE REVIEW THE STATUS OF EACH SIGNIFICANT MATTER AND ASSESS OUR POTENTIAL\nFINANCIAL EXPOSURE. A DESCRIPTION OF OUR ACCOUNTING POLICIES ASSOCIATED WITH CONTINGENCIES ASSUMED AS A PART OF A BUSINESS COMBINATION IS PROVIDED UNDER \u0093BUSINESS COMBINATIONS\u0094 ABOVE. FOR LEGAL AND OTHER CONTINGENCIES THAT ARE NOT A PART\nOF A BUSINESS COMBINATION, WE ACCRUE A LIABILITY FOR AN ESTIMATED LOSS IF THE POTENTIAL LOSS FROM ANY CLAIM OR LEGAL PROCEEDING IS CONSIDERED PROBABLE AND THE AMOUNT CAN BE REASONABLY ESTIMATED. SIGNIFICANT JUDGMENT IS REQUIRED IN BOTH THE\nDETERMINATION OF PROBABILITY AND THE DETERMINATION AS TO WHETHER THE AMOUNT OF AN EXPOSURE IS REASONABLY ESTIMABLE. BECAUSE OF UNCERTAINTIES RELATED TO THESE MATTERS, ACCRUALS ARE BASED ONLY ON THE BEST INFORMATION AVAILABLE AT THE TIME THE ACCRUALS\nARE MADE. AS ADDITIONAL INFORMATION BECOMES AVAILABLE, WE REASSESS THE POTENTIAL LIABILITY RELATED TO OUR PENDING CLAIMS AND LITIGATION AND MAY REVISE OUR ESTIMATES. SUCH REVISIONS IN THE ESTIMATES OF THE POTENTIAL LIABILITIES COULD HAVE A MATERIAL\nIMPACT ON OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL POSITION.\nSTOCK-BASED COMPENSATION\nWE ACCOUNT FOR SHARE-BASED PAYMENTS TO EMPLOYEES, INCLUDING GRANTS OF EMPLOYEE STOCK OPTIONS, RESTRICTED STOCK-BASED AWARDS AND PURCHASES UNDER EMPLOYEE\nSTOCK PURCHASE PLANS, IN ACCORDANCE WITH ASC 718,\nCOMPENSATION\u0097STOCK COMPENSATION,\nWHICH REQUIRES THAT SHARE-BASED PAYMENTS (TO THE EXTENT THEY ARE COMPENSATORY) BE RECOGNIZED IN OUR CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF OPERATIONS BASED ON THEIR\nFAIR VALUES. WE RECOGNIZE STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION EXPENSE ON A STRAIGHT-LINE BASIS OVER THE SERVICE PERIOD OF THE AWARD, WHICH IS GENERALLY FOUR YEARS.\nWE ARE REQUIRED TO ESTIMATE THE STOCK AWARDS THAT WE ULTIMATELY EXPECT TO VEST AND TO REDUCE STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION EXPENSE FOR THE EFFECTS OF ESTIMATED FORFEITURES OF AWARDS OVER THE EXPENSE\nRECOGNITION PERIOD. ALTHOUGH WE ESTIMATE THE RATE OF FUTURE\n45\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nFORFEITURES BASED UPON HISTORICAL EXPERIENCE, ACTUAL FORFEITURES IN THE FUTURE MAY DIFFER. TO THE EXTENT OUR ACTUAL FORFEITURES ARE DIFFERENT THAN OUR ESTIMATES, WE RECORD A TRUE-UP FOR THE\nDIFFERENCE IN THE PERIOD THAT THE AWARDS VEST AND SUCH TRUE-UPS COULD MATERIALLY AFFECT OUR OPERATING RESULTS. ADDITIONALLY, WE ALSO CONSIDER ON A QUARTERLY BASIS WHETHER THERE HAVE BEEN ANY SIGNIFICANT CHANGES IN FACTS AND CIRCUMSTANCES THAT WOULD\nAFFECT OUR EXPECTED FORFEITURE RATE.\nWE ESTIMATE THE FAIR VALUES OF EMPLOYEE STOCK OPTIONS USING A BLACK-SCHOLES-MERTON VALUATION MODEL. THE\nFAIR VALUE OF AN AWARD IS AFFECTED BY OUR STOCK PRICE ON THE DATE OF GRANT AS WELL AS OTHER ASSUMPTIONS INCLUDING THE ESTIMATED VOLATILITY OF OUR STOCK PRICE OVER THE TERM OF THE AWARDS AND THE ESTIMATED PERIOD OF TIME THAT WE EXPECT EMPLOYEES TO\nHOLD THEIR STOCK OPTIONS. THE RISK-FREE INTEREST RATE ASSUMPTION WE USE IS BASED UPON U.S. TREASURY INTEREST RATES APPROPRIATE FOR THE EXPECTED LIFE OF THE AWARDS. WE USE THE IMPLIED VOLATILITY OF PUBLICLY TRADED OPTIONS IN OUR STOCK IN ORDER TO\nESTIMATE FUTURE STOCK PRICE TRENDS AS WE BELIEVE THAT IMPLIED VOLATILITY IS MORE REPRESENTATIVE OF FUTURE STOCK PRICE TRENDS THAN HISTORICAL VOLATILITY. IN ORDER TO DETERMINE THE ESTIMATED PERIOD OF TIME THAT WE EXPECT EMPLOYEES TO HOLD THEIR STOCK\nOPTIONS, WE HAVE USED HISTORICAL RATES OF EMPLOYEE GROUPS BY SENIORITY OF JOB CLASSIFICATION. OUR EXPECTED DIVIDEND RATE IS BASED UPON AN ANNUALIZED DIVIDEND YIELD BASED ON THE PER SHARE DIVIDEND DECLARED BY OUR BOARD OF DIRECTORS. THE\nAFOREMENTIONED INPUTS ENTERED INTO THE OPTION VALUATION MODEL WE USE TO FAIR VALUE OUR STOCK AWARDS ARE SUBJECTIVE ESTIMATES AND CHANGES TO THESE ESTIMATES WILL CAUSE THE FAIR VALUES OF OUR STOCK AWARDS AND RELATED STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION EXPENSE\nTHAT WE RECORD TO VARY.\nWE RECORD DEFERRED TAX ASSETS FOR STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION AWARDS THAT RESULT IN DEDUCTIONS ON OUR INCOME TAX RETURNS,\nBASED ON THE AMOUNT OF STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION RECOGNIZED AND THE FAIR VALUES ATTRIBUTABLE TO THE VESTED PORTION OF STOCK AWARDS ASSUMED IN CONNECTION WITH A BUSINESS COMBINATION, AT THE STATUTORY TAX RATE IN THE JURISDICTION IN WHICH WE WILL\nRECEIVE A TAX DEDUCTION. BECAUSE THE DEFERRED TAX ASSETS WE RECORD ARE BASED UPON THE STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION EXPENSES IN A PARTICULAR JURISDICTION, THE AFOREMENTIONED INPUTS THAT AFFECT THE FAIR VALUES OF OUR STOCK AWARDS MAY ALSO INDIRECTLY\nAFFECT OUR INCOME TAX EXPENSE. IN ADDITION, DIFFERENCES BETWEEN THE DEFERRED TAX ASSETS RECOGNIZED FOR FINANCIAL REPORTING PURPOSES AND THE ACTUAL TAX DEDUCTION REPORTED ON OUR INCOME TAX RETURNS ARE RECORDED IN ADDITIONAL PAID-IN CAPITAL. IF THE\nTAX DEDUCTION IS LESS THAN THE DEFERRED TAX ASSET, THE CALCULATED SHORTFALL REDUCES OUR POOL OF EXCESS TAX BENEFITS. IF THE POOL OF EXCESS TAX BENEFITS IS REDUCED TO ZERO, THEN SUBSEQUENT SHORTFALLS WOULD INCREASE OUR INCOME TAX EXPENSE.\nTO THE EXTENT WE CHANGE THE TERMS OF OUR EMPLOYEE STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION PROGRAMS, EXPERIENCE MARKET VOLATILITY IN THE PRICING OF OUR COMMON STOCK THAT\nINCREASES THE IMPLIED VOLATILITY CALCULATION OF PUBLICLY TRADED OPTIONS IN OUR STOCK, REFINE DIFFERENT ASSUMPTIONS IN FUTURE PERIODS SUCH AS FORFEITURE RATES THAT DIFFER FROM OUR CURRENT ESTIMATES, OR ASSUME STOCK AWARDS FROM ACQUIRED COMPANIES THAT\nARE DIFFERENT IN NATURE THAN OUR STOCK AWARD ARRANGEMENTS, AMONG OTHER POTENTIAL IMPACTS, THE STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION EXPENSE THAT WE RECORD IN FUTURE PERIODS AND THE TAX BENEFITS THAT WE REALIZE MAY DIFFER SIGNIFICANTLY FROM WHAT WE HAVE RECORDED\nIN PREVIOUS REPORTING PERIODS.\nALLOWANCES FOR DOUBTFUL ACCOUNTS\nWE MAKE JUDGMENTS AS TO OUR ABILITY TO COLLECT OUTSTANDING RECEIVABLES AND PROVIDE ALLOWANCES FOR THE PORTION OF RECEIVABLES WHEN COLLECTION BECOMES DOUBTFUL. PROVISIONS ARE MADE BASED UPON A SPECIFIC\nREVIEW OF ALL SIGNIFICANT OUTSTANDING INVOICES. FOR THOSE INVOICES NOT SPECIFICALLY REVIEWED, PROVISIONS ARE PROVIDED AT DIFFERING RATES, BASED UPON THE AGE OF THE RECEIVABLE, THE COLLECTION HISTORY ASSOCIATED WITH THE GEOGRAPHIC REGION THAT THE\nRECEIVABLE WAS RECORDED AND CURRENT ECONOMIC TRENDS.

IN ORDER TO PROVIDE A FRAMEWORK FOR ASSESSING HOW OUR UNDERLYING BUSINESSES PERFORMED\nEXCLUDING THE EFFECT OF FOREIGN CURRENCY FLUCTUATIONS, WE COMPARE THE PERCENT CHANGE IN THE RESULTS FROM ONE PERIOD TO ANOTHER PERIOD IN THIS ANNUAL REPORT USING CONSTANT CURRENCY DISCLOSURE. TO PRESENT THIS INFORMATION, CURRENT AND COMPARATIVE\nPRIOR PERIOD RESULTS FOR ENTITIES REPORTING IN CURRENCIES OTHER THAN U.S. DOLLARS ARE CONVERTED INTO U.S. DOLLARS AT CONSTANT EXCHANGE RATES (I.E. THE RATES IN EFFECT ON MAY 31, 2012, WHICH WAS THE LAST DAY OF OUR PRIOR FISCAL YEAR) RATHER THAN\nTHE ACTUAL EXCHANGE RATES IN EFFECT DURING THE RESPECTIVE PERIODS. FOR EXAMPLE, IF AN ENTITY REPORTING IN EUROS HAD REVENUES OF 1.0 MILLION EUROS FROM PRODUCTS SOLD ON MAY 31, 2013 AND MAY 31, 2012, OUR FINANCIAL STATEMENTS WOULD\nREFLECT REPORTED REVENUES OF $1.29 MILLION IN FISCAL 2013 (USING 1.29 AS THE MONTH-END AVERAGE EXCHANGE RATE FOR THE PERIOD) AND $1.25 MILLION IN FISCAL 2012 (USING 1.25 AS THE MONTH-END AVERAGE EXCHANGE RATE FOR THE PERIOD). THE CONSTANT CURRENCY\nPRESENTATION WOULD TRANSLATE THE FISCAL 2013 RESULTS USING THE FISCAL 2012 EXCHANGE RATE AND INDICATE, IN THIS EXAMPLE, NO CHANGE IN REVENUES DURING THE PERIOD. IN EACH OF THE TABLES BELOW, WE PRESENT THE PERCENT CHANGE BASED ON ACTUAL, UNROUNDED\nRESULTS IN REPORTED CURRENCY AND IN CONSTANT CURRENCY.\n47\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nTOTAL REVENUES AND OPERATING EXPENSES\nYEAR ENDED MAY 31,\n2013\nPERCENT CHANGE\n2012\nPERCENT CHANGE\n2011\n(DOLLARS IN MILLIONS)\nACTUAL\nCONSTANT\nACTUAL\nCONSTANT\nTOTAL REVENUES BY GEOGRAPHY.\nAMERICAS\n$19,719\n3%\n3%\n$19,236\n5%\n5%\n$18,352\nEMEA\n(1)\n11,158\n-3%\n0%\n11,561\n1%\n1%\n11,497\nASIA PACIFIC\n(2)\n6,303\n0%\n3%\n6,324\n10%\n7%\n5,773\nTOTAL REVENUES\n37,180\n0%\n2%\n37,121\n4%\n4%\n35,622\nTOTAL OPERATING EXPENSES\n22,496\n-4%\n-2%\n23,415\n-1%\n-1%\n23,589\nTOTAL OPERATING MARGIN\n$14,684\n7%\n10%\n$13,706\n14%\n14%\n$12,033\nTOTAL OPERATING MARGIN %\n39%\n37%\n34%% REVENUES BY GEOGRAPHY.\nAMERICAS\n53%\n52%\n52%\nEMEA\n30%\n31%\n32%\nASIA PACIFIC\n17%\n17%\n16%\nTOTAL REVENUES BY BUSINESS.\nSOFTWARE\n$27,463\n5%\n7%\n$26,116\n9%\n9%\n$24,031\nHARDWARE SYSTEMS\n5,346\n-15%\n-13%\n6,302\n-9%\n-10%\n6,944\nSERVICES\n4,371\n-7%\n-5%\n4,703\n1%\n1%\n4,647\nTOTAL REVENUES\n$37,180\n0%\n2%\n$37,121\n4%\n4%\n$35,622% REVENUES BY BUSINESS.\nSOFTWARE\n74%\n70%\n68%\nHARDWARE SYSTEMS\n14%\n17%\n19%\nSERVICES\n12%\n13%\n13%\n(1)\nCOMPRISED OF EUROPE, THE MIDDLE EAST AND AFRICA\n(2)\nASIA PACIFIC INCLUDES JAPAN\nFISCAL 2013 COMPARED TO FISCAL 2012\n.\nEXCLUDING THE EFFECT OF UNFAVORABLE FOREIGN CURRENCY RATE FLUCTUATIONS OF\n2 PERCENTAGE POINTS, OUR TOTAL REVENUES INCREASED IN FISCAL 2013 DUE TO AN INCREASE IN OUR SOFTWARE BUSINESS REVENUES, WHICH WAS ATTRIBUTABLE TO GROWTH IN OUR SOFTWARE LICENSE UPDATES AND PRODUCT SUPPORT REVENUES AND OUR NEW SOFTWARE LICENSES AND\nCLOUD SOFTWARE SUBSCRIPTIONS REVENUES.

MORGAN SECURITIES, LLC, AS SOLE LEAD ARRANGER AND SOLE BOOKRUNNER (THE 2012 CREDIT AGREEMENT) TO BORROW $1.7 BILLION WAS REPAID IN FULL AND THE 2012 CREDIT AGREEMENT EXPIRED PURSUANT TO ITS TERMS.\nSENIOR NOTES\n:    AS OF MAY 31, 2013, WE HAD $18.5 BILLION OF SENIOR NOTES OUTSTANDING ($14.8 BILLION\nOUTSTANDING AS OF MAY 31, 2012). IN APRIL 2013, OUR 4.95% FIXED RATE SENIOR NOTES FOR $1.25 BILLION MATURED AND WERE REPAID. IN OCTOBER 2012, WE ISSUED\n63\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\n$5.0 BILLION OF FIXED RATE SENIOR NOTES COMPRISED OF $2.5 BILLION OF 1.20% NOTES DUE OCTOBER 2017 AND $2.5 BILLION OF 2.50% NOTES DUE OCTOBER 2022. WE ISSUED THESE SENIOR NOTES FOR GENERAL\nCORPORATE PURPOSES, WHICH MAY INCLUDE STOCK REPURCHASES, FUTURE ACQUISITIONS AND REPAYMENT OF INDEBTEDNESS. ADDITIONAL DETAILS REGARDING THESE SENIOR NOTES AND ALL OTHER BORROWINGS ARE INCLUDED IN THE \u0093CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS\u0094 SECTION\nBELOW AND IN NOTE 8 OF NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS INCLUDED ELSEWHERE IN THIS ANNUAL REPORT.\nCASH\nDIVIDENDS\n:    DURING FISCAL 2013, OUR BOARD OF DIRECTORS DECLARED AND PAID CASH DIVIDENDS IN THE AGGREGATE OF $0.30 PER SHARE OF OUTSTANDING COMMON STOCK, WHICH INCLUDED AN ACCELERATED CASH DIVIDEND OF $0.18 PER SHARE OF\nOUTSTANDING COMMON STOCK PAID ON DECEMBER 21, 2012. THIS ACCELERATED CASH DIVIDEND WAS INTENDED BY OUR BOARD OF DIRECTORS TO BE IN LIEU OF QUARTERLY DIVIDENDS THAT WE WOULD HAVE OTHERWISE ANNOUNCED WITH OUR EARNINGS RESULTS FOR THE SECOND,\nTHIRD AND FOURTH QUARTERS OF FISCAL 2013, AND THAT WOULD HAVE BEEN PAID IN CALENDAR YEAR 2013. DURING FISCAL 2012, WE DECLARED AND PAID CASH DIVIDENDS TOTALING $0.24 PER SHARE OF OUTSTANDING COMMON STOCK.\nIN JUNE 2013, OUR BOARD OF DIRECTORS DECLARED A QUARTERLY CASH DIVIDEND OF $0.12 PER SHARE OF OUTSTANDING COMMON STOCK. THIS $0.12 PER SHARE CASH DIVIDEND WAS\nAN INCREASE OF $0.06 PER SHARE OVER THE LAST REGULAR QUARTERLY CASH DIVIDEND OF $0.06 PER SHARE OF OUTSTANDING COMMON STOCK PAID ON NOVEMBER 2, 2012 AND WAS DECLARED EARLIER THAN THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS HAD PREVIOUSLY PLANNED. THE $0.12 PER\nSHARE CASH DIVIDEND IS PAYABLE ON AUGUST 2, 2013 TO STOCKHOLDERS OF RECORD AS OF THE CLOSE OF BUSINESS ON JULY 12, 2013. WE CURRENTLY EXPECT TO CONTINUE PAYING COMPARABLE CASH DIVIDENDS ON A QUARTERLY BASIS IN THE FUTURE; HOWEVER, FUTURE\nDECLARATIONS OF DIVIDENDS AND THE ESTABLISHMENT OF FUTURE RECORD AND PAYMENT DATES ARE SUBJECT TO THE FINAL DETERMINATION OF OUR BOARD OF DIRECTORS.\nCOMMON STOCK REPURCHASES\n:    OUR BOARD OF DIRECTORS HAS APPROVED A PROGRAM FOR US TO REPURCHASE SHARES OF OUR COMMON STOCK. ON\nJUNE 18, 2012, WE ANNOUNCED THAT OUR BOARD OF DIRECTORS APPROVED AN EXPANSION OF OUR STOCK REPURCHASE PROGRAM BY AN ADDITIONAL $10.0 BILLION. ON JUNE 20, 2013, WE ANNOUNCED THAT OUR BOARD OF DIRECTORS APPROVED A FURTHER EXPANSION BY AN\nADDITIONAL $12.0 BILLION. AS OF MAY 31, 2013, APPROXIMATELY $2.1 BILLION REMAINED AVAILABLE FOR STOCK REPURCHASES UNDER THE STOCK REPURCHASE PROGRAM PRIOR TO THE ADDITIONAL AMOUNT AUTHORIZED IN JUNE 2013. WE REPURCHASED 346.1 MILLION\nSHARES FOR $11.0 BILLION, 207.3 MILLION SHARES FOR $6.0 BILLION AND 40.4 MILLION SHARES FOR $1.2 BILLION IN FISCAL 2013, 2012 AND 2011, RESPECTIVELY. OUR STOCK REPURCHASE AUTHORIZATION DOES NOT HAVE AN EXPIRATION DATE AND THE PACE OF OUR\nREPURCHASE ACTIVITY WILL DEPEND ON FACTORS SUCH AS OUR WORKING CAPITAL NEEDS, OUR CASH REQUIREMENTS FOR ACQUISITIONS AND DIVIDEND PAYMENTS, OUR DEBT REPAYMENT OBLIGATIONS (DESCRIBED FURTHER BELOW), OUR STOCK PRICE AND ECONOMIC AND MARKET CONDITIONS.\nOUR STOCK REPURCHASES MAY BE EFFECTED FROM TIME TO TIME THROUGH OPEN MARKET PURCHASES OR PURSUANT TO A RULE 10B5-1 PLAN.

THE CHANGES IN FAIR VALUE OF OUR DEBT ASSOCIATED WITH THE\nINTEREST RATE RISK THAT WE ARE HEDGING PURSUANT TO THESE AGREEMENTS WERE INCLUDED IN NOTES PAYABLE AND OTHER NON-CURRENT BORROWINGS IN OUR CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEET AND HAVE BEEN INCLUDED IN THE ABOVE TABLE OF BORROWINGS.\n(2)\nPRIMARILY REPRESENTS LEASES OF FACILITIES AND INCLUDES FUTURE MINIMUM RENT PAYMENTS FOR FACILITIES THAT WE HAVE VACATED PURSUANT TO OUR RESTRUCTURING AND MERGER INTEGRATION ACTIVITIES.

WE UTILIZE SEVERAL EXTERNAL MANUFACTURERS TO MANUFACTURE SUB-ASSEMBLIES FOR OUR HARDWARE PRODUCTS AND TO PERFORM FINAL ASSEMBLY AND TESTING OF FINISHED HARDWARE PRODUCTS. WE ALSO OBTAIN INDIVIDUAL HARDWARE\nCOMPONENTS FOR OUR PRODUCTS FROM A VARIETY OF INDIVIDUAL SUPPLIERS BASED ON PROJECTED DEMAND INFORMATION. SUCH PURCHASE COMMITMENTS ARE BASED ON OUR FORECASTED COMPONENT AND MANUFACTURING REQUIREMENTS AND TYPICALLY PROVIDE FOR FULFILLMENT WITHIN\nAGREED UPON LEAD-TIMES AND\/OR COMMERCIALLY STANDARD LEAD-TIMES FOR THE PARTICULAR PART OR PRODUCT AND HAVE BEEN INCLUDED IN THE AMOUNT PRESENTED IN THE ABOVE CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS TABLE.

WE HAVE REACHED\nCERTAIN SETTLEMENT AGREEMENTS WITH RELEVANT TAX AUTHORITIES TO PAY APPROXIMATELY $15 MILLION OF THESE LIABILITIES. ALTHOUGH IT REMAINS UNCLEAR AS TO WHEN PAYMENTS PURSUANT TO THESE AGREEMENTS WILL BE MADE, SOME OR ALL MAY BE MADE IN FISCAL 2014. WE\nCANNOT MAKE A REASONABLY RELIABLE ESTIMATE OF THE PERIOD IN WHICH THE REMAINDER OF OUR UNRECOGNIZED INCOME TAX BENEFITS WILL BE SETTLED OR RELEASED WITH THE RELEVANT TAX AUTHORITIES, ALTHOUGH WE BELIEVE IT IS REASONABLY POSSIBLE THAT CERTAIN OF\nTHESE LIABILITIES COULD BE SETTLED OR RELEASED DURING FISCAL 2014.\nSUBSEQUENT TO FISCAL 2013, WE AGREED TO ACQUIRE A COMPANY FOR AN AMOUNT THAT IS NOT\nMATERIAL TO OUR BUSINESS. WE EXPECT TO CLOSE THE ACQUISITION WITHIN THE NEXT TWELVE MONTHS.\n65\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nWE BELIEVE THAT OUR CURRENT CASH, CASH EQUIVALENTS AND MARKETABLE SECURITIES AND CASH GENERATED FROM\nOPERATIONS WILL BE SUFFICIENT TO MEET OUR WORKING CAPITAL, CAPITAL EXPENDITURES AND CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATION REQUIREMENTS. IN ADDITION, WE BELIEVE WE COULD FUND ANY FUTURE ACQUISITIONS, DIVIDEND PAYMENTS AND REPURCHASES OF COMMON STOCK OR DEBT WITH\nOUR INTERNALLY AVAILABLE CASH, CASH EQUIVALENTS AND MARKETABLE SECURITIES, CASH GENERATED FROM OPERATIONS, ADDITIONAL BORROWINGS OR FROM THE ISSUANCE OF ADDITIONAL SECURITIES.\nOFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS.\nWE DO NOT HAVE ANY OFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS THAT HAVE OR ARE REASONABLY LIKELY TO HAVE A CURRENT OR FUTURE EFFECT ON OUR\nFINANCIAL CONDITION, CHANGES IN FINANCIAL CONDITION, REVENUES OR EXPENSES, RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, LIQUIDITY, CAPITAL EXPENDITURES OR CAPITAL RESOURCES THAT ARE MATERIAL TO INVESTORS.\nSELECTED QUARTERLY FINANCIAL DATA\nQUARTERLY REVENUES, EXPENSES AND OPERATING INCOME HAVE\nHISTORICALLY BEEN AFFECTED BY A VARIETY OF SEASONAL FACTORS, INCLUDING SALES FORCE INCENTIVE COMPENSATION PLANS. IN ADDITION, OUR EUROPEAN OPERATIONS GENERALLY PROVIDE LOWER REVENUES IN OUR FIRST FISCAL QUARTER BECAUSE OF THE REDUCED ECONOMIC\nACTIVITY IN EUROPE DURING THE SUMMER. THESE SEASONAL FACTORS ARE COMMON IN THE HIGH TECHNOLOGY INDUSTRY. THESE FACTORS HAVE CAUSED A DECREASE IN OUR FIRST QUARTER REVENUES AS COMPARED TO REVENUES IN THE IMMEDIATELY PRECEDING FOURTH QUARTER, WHICH\nHISTORICALLY HAS BEEN OUR HIGHEST REVENUE QUARTER WITHIN A PARTICULAR FISCAL YEAR. SIMILARLY, THE OPERATING INCOME OF OUR BUSINESS IS AFFECTED BY SEASONAL FACTORS IN A CONSISTENT MANNER AS OUR REVENUES (IN PARTICULAR, OUR NEW SOFTWARE LICENSES AND\nCLOUD SOFTWARE SUBSCRIPTIONS SEGMENT) AS CERTAIN EXPENSES WITHIN OUR COST STRUCTURE ARE RELATIVELY FIXED IN THE SHORT-TERM. WE EXPECT THESE TRENDS TO CONTINUE IN FISCAL 2014.\nTHE FOLLOWING TABLES SET FORTH SELECTED UNAUDITED QUARTERLY INFORMATION FOR OUR LAST EIGHT FISCAL QUARTERS.

WE HISTORICALLY HAVE GRANTED ONLY STOCK OPTIONS TO OUR EMPLOYEES AND ANY RESTRICTED STOCK-BASED AWARDS OUTSTANDING WERE ASSUMED AS A RESULT OF OUR ACQUISITIONS.\nWE RECOGNIZE THAT STOCK OPTIONS AND RESTRICTED STOCK-BASED AWARDS DILUTE EXISTING STOCKHOLDERS AND HAVE SOUGHT TO CONTROL THE NUMBER OF STOCK OPTIONS AND RESTRICTED STOCK-BASED AWARDS GRANTED WHILE\nPROVIDING COMPETITIVE COMPENSATION PACKAGES. CONSISTENT WITH THESE DUAL GOALS, OUR CUMULATIVE POTENTIAL DILUTION SINCE JUNE 1, 2010 HAS BEEN A WEIGHTED AVERAGE ANNUALIZED RATE OF 2.0% PER YEAR. THE POTENTIAL DILUTION PERCENTAGE IS\nCALCULATED AS THE AVERAGE ANNUALIZED NEW STOCK OPTIONS OR RESTRICTED STOCK-BASED AWARDS GRANTED AND ASSUMED, NET OF STOCK OPTIONS AND RESTRICTED STOCK-BASED AWARDS FORFEITED BY EMPLOYEES LEAVING THE COMPANY, DIVIDED\n66\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nBY THE WEIGHTED AVERAGE OUTSTANDING SHARES DURING THE CALCULATION PERIOD.

OF THE OUTSTANDING STOCK OPTIONS AT MAY 31, 2013, WHICH GENERALLY HAVE A 10-YEAR EXERCISE PERIOD, LESS THAN 2% HAVE EXERCISE PRICES HIGHER THAN THE CURRENT MARKET PRICE OF OUR COMMON STOCK. IN RECENT YEARS, OUR STOCK REPURCHASE PROGRAM\nHAS MORE THAN OFFSET THE DILUTIVE EFFECT OF OUR STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION PROGRAM; HOWEVER, WE MAY REDUCE THE LEVEL OF OUR STOCK REPURCHASES IN THE FUTURE AS WE MAY USE OUR AVAILABLE CASH FOR ACQUISITIONS, TO PAY DIVIDENDS, TO REPAY OR REPURCHASE\nINDEBTEDNESS OR FOR OTHER PURPOSES. AT MAY 31, 2013, THE MAXIMUM POTENTIAL DILUTION FROM ALL OUTSTANDING AND UNEXERCISED STOCK OPTIONS AND RESTRICTED STOCK-BASED AWARDS, REGARDLESS OF WHEN GRANTED AND REGARDLESS OF WHETHER VESTED OR UNVESTED\nAND INCLUDING STOCK OPTIONS WHERE THE STRIKE PRICE IS HIGHER THAN THE CURRENT MARKET PRICE, WAS 9.6%.\nTHE COMPENSATION COMMITTEE OF THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS\nREVIEWS AND APPROVES THE ORGANIZATION-WIDE STOCK OPTION GRANTS TO SELECTED EMPLOYEES, ALL STOCK OPTION GRANTS TO EXECUTIVE OFFICERS AND ANY INDIVIDUAL STOCK OPTION GRANTS IN EXCESS OF 100,000 SHARES.

OUR MOST\nSIGNIFICANT EXPENSES ARE RELATED TO COMPENSATING EMPLOYEES, DESIGNING, MANUFACTURING, MARKETING, AND SELLING OUR PRODUCTS AND SERVICES, AND INCOME TAXES.\nINDUSTRY TRENDS\nOUR INDUSTRY IS DYNAMIC\nAND HIGHLY COMPETITIVE, WITH FREQUENT CHANGES IN BOTH TECHNOLOGIES AND BUSINESS MODELS. EACH INDUSTRY SHIFT IS AN OPPORTUNITY TO CONCEIVE NEW PRODUCTS, NEW TECHNOLOGIES, OR NEW IDEAS THAT CAN FURTHER TRANSFORM THE INDUSTRY AND OUR BUSINESS. AT\nMICROSOFT, WE PUSH THE BOUNDARIES OF WHAT IS POSSIBLE THROUGH A BROAD RANGE OF RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT ACTIVITIES THAT SEEK TO IDENTIFY AND ADDRESS THE CHANGING DEMANDS OF CUSTOMERS, INDUSTRY TRENDS, AND COMPETITIVE FORCES.\nKEY OPPORTUNITIES AND INVESTMENTS\nBASED ON\nOUR ASSESSMENT OF KEY TECHNOLOGY TRENDS AND OUR BROAD FOCUS ON LONG-TERM RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT OF NEW PRODUCTS AND SERVICES, WE SEE SIGNIFICANT OPPORTUNITIES TO GENERATE FUTURE GROWTH.\nWE INVEST RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT RESOURCES IN NEW PRODUCTS AND SERVICES IN THESE AREAS. THE CAPABILITIES AND ACCESSIBILITY OF PCS, TABLETS,\nPHONES, TELEVISIONS, AND OTHER DEVICES POWERED BY RICH SOFTWARE PLATFORMS AND APPLICATIONS CONTINUE TO GROW. WITH THIS TREND, WE BELIEVE THE FULL POTENTIAL OF SOFTWARE WILL BE SEEN AND FELT IN HOW PEOPLE USE THESE DEVICES AND THE ASSOCIATED SERVICES\nAT WORK AND IN THEIR PERSONAL LIVES.\nDEVICES WITH END-USER SERVICES\nWE WORK WITH AN ECOSYSTEM OF PARTNERS TO DELIVER A BROAD SPECTRUM OF WINDOWS DEVICES. IN SOME CASES, WE BUILD OUR OWN DEVICES, AS WE HAVE CHOSEN TO DO WITH XBOX AND SURFACE. IN ALL OUR WORK WITH PARTNERS AND ON OUR\nOWN DEVICES, WE FOCUS ON DELIVERING SEAMLESS SERVICES AND EXPERIENCES ACROSS DEVICES. AS CONSUMER SERVICES AND HARDWARE ADVANCE, WE EXPECT THEY WILL CONTINUE TO BETTER COMPLEMENT ONE ANOTHER, CONNECTING THE DEVICES PEOPLE USE DAILY TO UNIQUE\nCOMMUNICATIONS, PRODUCTIVITY, AND ENTERTAINMENT SERVICES FROM MICROSOFT AND OUR PARTNERS AND DEVELOPERS AROUND THE WORLD.\nWINDOWS 8\nREFLECTS THIS SHIFT. LAUNCHED IN OCTOBER 2012, WINDOWS 8 WAS DESIGNED TO UNITE THE LIGHT, THIN, AND CONVENIENT ASPECTS OF A TABLET WITH THE POWER OF A PC. THE WINDOWS 8 OPERATING SYSTEM INCLUDES THE WINDOWS STORE, WHICH OFFERS A LARGE AND GROWING\nNUMBER OF APPLICATIONS FROM MICROSOFT AND PARTNERS FOR BOTH BUSINESS AND CONSUMER CUSTOMERS.\nGOING FORWARD, OUR STRATEGY WILL FOCUS ON\nCREATING A FAMILY OF DEVICES AND SERVICES FOR INDIVIDUALS AND BUSINESSES THAT EMPOWER PEOPLE AROUND THE GLOBE AT HOME, AT WORK, AND ON THE GO, FOR THE ACTIVITIES THEY VALUE MOST. THIS STRATEGY WILL REQUIRE INVESTMENT IN DATACENTERS AND OTHER\nINFRASTRUCTURE TO SUPPORT OUR SERVICES, AND WILL BRING CONTINUED COMPETITION WITH APPLE, GOOGLE, AND OTHER WELL-ESTABLISHED AND EMERGING COMPETITORS. WE BELIEVE OUR HISTORY OF POWERING DEVICES SUCH AS WINDOWS PCS AND XBOX, AS WELL AS OUR EXPERIENCE\nDELIVERING HIGH-VALUE EXPERIENCES THROUGH OFFICE AND OTHER APPLICATIONS, WILL POSITION US FOR FUTURE SUCCESS.\nSERVICES FOR THE ENTERPRISE\nTODAY, BUSINESSES FACE IMPORTANT OPPORTUNITIES AND CHALLENGES. ENTERPRISES ARE ASKED TO DEPLOY TECHNOLOGY THAT DRIVES BUSINESS\nSTRATEGY FORWARD. THEY DECIDE WHAT SOLUTIONS WILL MAKE EMPLOYEES MORE PRODUCTIVE, COLLABORATIVE, AND SATISFIED, OR CONNECT WITH CUSTOMERS IN NEW AND COMPELLING WAYS. THEY WORK TO UNLOCK BUSINESS INSIGHTS FROM A WORLD OF DATA. AT THE SAME TIME, THEY\nMUST MANAGE AND SECURE CORPORATE INFORMATION THAT EMPLOYEES ACCESS ACROSS A GROWING NUMBER OF PERSONAL AND CORPORATE DEVICES.\n24\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nPART II\nITEM 7\nTO ADDRESS THESE OPPORTUNITIES, BUSINESSES LOOK TO OUR WORLD-CLASS BUSINESS APPLICATIONS LIKE\nMICROSOFT DYNAMICS, OFFICE, EXCHANGE, SHAREPOINT, LYNC, YAMMER, AND OUR BUSINESS INTELLIGENCE SOLUTIONS. THEY RELY ON OUR TECHNOLOGY TO MANAGE EMPLOYEE CORPORATE IDENTITY AND TO PROTECT THEIR CORPORATE DATA. AND, INCREASINGLY, BUSINESSES OF ALL\nSIZES ARE LOOKING TO MICROSOFT TO REALIZE THE BENEFITS OF THE CLOUD.\nHELPING BUSINESSES MOVE TO THE CLOUD IS ONE OF OUR LARGEST\nOPPORTUNITIES. CLOUD-BASED SOLUTIONS PROVIDE CUSTOMERS WITH SOFTWARE, SERVICES, AND CONTENT OVER THE INTERNET BY WAY OF SHARED COMPUTING RESOURCES LOCATED IN CENTRALIZED DATA CENTERS. THE SHIFT TO THE CLOUD IS DRIVEN BY THREE IMPORTANT ECONOMIES OF\nSCALE: LARGER DATA CENTERS CAN DEPLOY COMPUTATIONAL RESOURCES AT SIGNIFICANTLY LOWER COST PER UNIT THAN SMALLER ONES; LARGER DATA CENTERS CAN COORDINATE AND AGGREGATE DIVERSE CUSTOMER, GEOGRAPHIC, AND APPLICATION DEMAND PATTERNS IMPROVING THE\nUTILIZATION OF COMPUTING, STORAGE, AND NETWORK RESOURCES; AND MULTI-TENANCY LOWERS APPLICATION MAINTENANCE LABOR COSTS FOR LARGE PUBLIC CLOUDS. BECAUSE OF THE IMPROVED ECONOMICS, THE CLOUD OFFERS UNIQUE LEVELS OF ELASTICITY AND AGILITY THAT ENABLE\nNEW SOLUTIONS AND APPLICATIONS. FOR BUSINESSES OF ALL SIZES, THE CLOUD CREATES THE OPPORTUNITY TO FOCUS ON INNOVATION WHILE LEAVING NON-DIFFERENTIATING ACTIVITIES TO RELIABLE AND COST-EFFECTIVE PROVIDERS.\nUNIQUE TO MICROSOFT, WE CONTINUE TO DESIGN AND DELIVER CLOUD SOLUTIONS THAT ALLOW OUR CUSTOMERS TO USE BOTH THE CLOUD AND THEIR ON-PREMISE ASSETS\nHOWEVER BEST SUITS THEIR OWN NEEDS. FOR EXAMPLE, A COMPANY CAN CHOOSE TO DEPLOY OFFICE OR MICROSOFT DYNAMICS ON PREMISE, AS A CLOUD SERVICE, OR A COMBINATION OF BOTH. WITH WINDOWS SERVER 2012, WINDOWS AZURE, AND SYSTEM CENTER INFRASTRUCTURE,\nBUSINESSES CAN DEPLOY APPLICATIONS IN THEIR OWN DATACENTER, A PARTNER\u0092S DATACENTER, OR IN MICROSOFT\u0092S DATACENTER WITH COMMON SECURITY, MANAGEMENT, AND ADMINISTRATION ACROSS ALL ENVIRONMENTS, WITH THE FLEXIBILITY AND SCALE THEY DESIRE.\nTHESE HYBRID CAPABILITIES ALLOW CUSTOMERS TO FULLY HARNESS THE POWER OF THE CLOUD SO THEY CAN ACHIEVE GREATER LEVELS OF EFFICIENCY AND TAP NEW AREAS OF GROWTH.\nOUR FUTURE OPPORTUNITY\nTHERE ARE SEVERAL DISTINCT AREAS OF TECHNOLOGY THAT WE ARE FOCUSED ON\nDRIVING FORWARD. OUR GOAL IS TO LEAD THE INDUSTRY IN THESE AREAS OVER THE LONG-TERM, WHICH WE EXPECT WILL TRANSLATE TO SUSTAINED GROWTH WELL INTO THE FUTURE. WE ARE INVESTING SIGNIFICANT RESOURCES IN.\n\u0095\nDEVELOPING NEW FORM FACTORS THAT HAVE INCREASINGLY NATURAL WAYS TO USE THEM, INCLUDING TOUCH, GESTURE, AND SPEECH.\n\u0095\nAPPLYING MACHINE LEARNING TO MAKE TECHNOLOGY MORE INTUITIVE AND ABLE TO ACT ON OUR BEHALF, INSTEAD OF AT OUR COMMAND.\n\u0095\nBUILDING AND RUNNING CLOUD-BASED SERVICES IN WAYS THAT UNLEASH NEW EXPERIENCES AND OPPORTUNITIES FOR BUSINESSES AND INDIVIDUALS.\n\u0095\nESTABLISHING OUR WINDOWS PLATFORM ACROSS THE PC, TABLET, PHONE, SERVER, AND CLOUD TO DRIVE A THRIVING ECOSYSTEM OF DEVELOPERS, UNIFY THE CROSS-DEVICE USER\nEXPERIENCE, AND INCREASE AGILITY WHEN BRINGING NEW ADVANCES TO MARKET.\n\u0095\nDELIVERING NEW HIGH-VALUE EXPERIENCES WITH IMPROVEMENTS IN HOW PEOPLE LEARN, WORK, PLAY, AND INTERACT WITH ONE ANOTHER.\nWE BELIEVE THE BREADTH OF OUR DEVICES AND SERVICES PORTFOLIO, OUR LARGE, GLOBAL PARTNER AND CUSTOMER BASE, AND THE GROWING WINDOWS ECOSYSTEM\nPOSITION US TO BE A LEADER IN THESE AREAS.\nECONOMIC CONDITIONS, CHALLENGES, AND RISKS\nTHE MARKET FOR SOFTWARE, DEVICES, AND CLOUD-BASED SERVICES IS DYNAMIC AND HIGHLY COMPETITIVE. SOME OF OUR TRADITIONAL BUSINESSES SUCH AS THE\nWINDOWS OPERATING SYSTEM ARE IN A PERIOD OF TRANSITION. OUR COMPETITORS ARE DEVELOPING NEW DEVICES AND DEPLOY COMPETING CLOUD-BASED SERVICES FOR CONSUMERS AND BUSINESSES. THE DEVICES AND FORM FACTORS CUSTOMERS PREFER EVOLVE RAPIDLY, AND INFLUENCE\nHOW USERS ACCESS SERVICES IN THE CLOUD AND IN SOME CASES THE USER\u0092S CHOICE OF WHICH SUITE OF CLOUD-BASED SERVICES TO USE. THE WINDOWS ECOSYSTEM MUST CONTINUE TO EVOLVE AND ADAPT, OVER AN EXTENDED TIME, IN PACE WITH THIS CHANGING ENVIRONMENT. TO\nSUPPORT OUR STRATEGY OF OFFERING\n25\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nPART II\nITEM 7\nA FAMILY OF DEVICES AND SERVICES DESIGNED TO EMPOWER OUR CUSTOMERS FOR THE ACTIVITIES THEY VALUE MOST, WE ANNOUNCED A FUNCTIONAL REALIGNMENT IN JULY 2013. THROUGH THIS REALIGNMENT OUR GOAL IS TO\nBECOME MORE NIMBLE, COLLABORATIVE, COMMUNICATIVE, MOTIVATED, AND DECISIVE. EVEN IF WE ACHIEVE THESE BENEFITS, THE INVESTMENTS WE ARE MAKING IN DEVICES AND INFRASTRUCTURE TO SUPPORT OUR CLOUD-BASED SERVICES WILL INCREASE OUR OPERATING COSTS AND MAY\nDECREASE OUR OPERATION MARGINS.\nWE PRIORITIZE OUR INVESTMENTS AMONG THE HIGHEST LONG-TERM GROWTH OPPORTUNITIES. THESE INVESTMENTS\nREQUIRE SIGNIFICANT RESOURCES AND ARE MULTI-YEAR IN NATURE. THE PRODUCTS AND SERVICES WE BRING TO MARKET MAY BE DEVELOPED INTERNALLY, AS PART OF A PARTNERSHIP OR ALLIANCE, OR THROUGH ACQUISITION.\nOUR SUCCESS IS HIGHLY DEPENDENT ON OUR ABILITY TO ATTRACT AND RETAIN QUALIFIED EMPLOYEES. WE HIRE A MIX OF UNIVERSITY AND INDUSTRY TALENT\nWORLDWIDE. MICROSOFT COMPETES FOR TALENTED INDIVIDUALS WORLDWIDE BY OFFERING BROAD CUSTOMER REACH, SCALE IN RESOURCES, AND COMPETITIVE COMPENSATION.\nAGGREGATE DEMAND FOR OUR SOFTWARE, SERVICES, AND HARDWARE IS CORRELATED TO GLOBAL MACROECONOMIC FACTORS, WHICH REMAIN DYNAMIC. SEE A DISCUSSION OF THESE FACTORS AND OTHER RISKS UNDER RISK FACTORS (PART I,\nITEM 1A OF THIS FORM 10-K).\nSEASONALITY\nOUR REVENUE HISTORICALLY HAS FLUCTUATED QUARTERLY AND HAS GENERALLY BEEN HIGHEST IN THE SECOND QUARTER OF OUR FISCAL YEAR DUE TO CORPORATE CALENDAR YEAR-END SPENDING TRENDS IN OUR MAJOR MARKETS AND HOLIDAY SEASON\nSPENDING BY CONSUMERS.

OUR EFFECTIVE TAX RATE WAS LOWER THAN THE U.S. FEDERAL STATUTORY RATE PRIMARILY DUE TO EARNINGS TAXED AT LOWER RATES IN FOREIGN JURISDICTIONS RESULTING FROM PRODUCING AND DISTRIBUTING OUR\nPRODUCTS AND SERVICES THROUGH OUR FOREIGN REGIONAL OPERATIONS CENTERS IN IRELAND, SINGAPORE, AND PUERTO RICO.\nOUR FISCAL YEAR 2013\nEFFECTIVE RATE DECREASED BY 5% FROM FISCAL YEAR 2012 MAINLY DUE TO A NONRECURRING $6.2 BILLION NON-TAX DEDUCTIBLE GOODWILL IMPAIRMENT CHARGE THAT WAS RECORDED IN FISCAL YEAR 2012. THE GOODWILL IMPAIRMENT CHARGE INCREASED OUR EFFECTIVE TAX RATE BY\n10% IN FISCAL YEAR 2012. IN ADDITION, IN FISCAL YEARS 2013 AND 2012, WE RECOGNIZED A REDUCTION OF 18% AND 21%, RESPECTIVELY, TO THE EFFECTIVE TAX RATE DUE TO FOREIGN EARNINGS TAXED AT LOWER RATES. THE DECREASE IN OUR EFFECTIVE TAX RATE FOR FISCAL\nYEAR 2013 WAS PRIMARILY OFFSET BY A 1% INCREASE RELATED TO THE EU FINE, WHICH IS NOT TAX DEDUCTIBLE.\nCHANGES IN THE MIX OF INCOME\nBEFORE INCOME TAXES BETWEEN THE U.S. AND FOREIGN COUNTRIES ALSO IMPACTED OUR EFFECTIVE TAX RATES AND RESULTED PRIMARILY FROM CHANGES IN THE GEOGRAPHIC DISTRIBUTION OF AND CHANGES IN CONSUMER DEMAND FOR OUR PRODUCTS AND SERVICES. AS DISCUSSED ABOVE,\nWINDOWS DIVISION OPERATING INCOME DECLINED $2.1 BILLION IN FISCAL YEAR 2013, WHILE MBD AND SERVER AND TOOLS OPERATING INCOME INCREASED $362 MILLION AND $929 MILLION, RESPECTIVELY, DURING THIS SAME PERIOD. WE SUPPLY WINDOWS, OUR PRIMARY WINDOWS\nDIVISION PRODUCT, TO CUSTOMERS THROUGH OUR U.S. REGIONAL OPERATING CENTER, WHILE WE SUPPLY THE MICROSOFT OFFICE SYSTEM, OUR PRIMARY MBD PRODUCT, AND OUR SERVER AND TOOLS PRODUCTS TO CUSTOMERS THROUGH OUR FOREIGN REGIONAL OPERATIONS CENTERS. IN\nFISCAL YEARS 2013 AND 2012, OUR U.S. INCOME BEFORE INCOME TAXES WAS $6.7 BILLION AND $1.6 BILLION, RESPECTIVELY, AND COMPRISED 25% AND 7%, RESPECTIVELY, OF OUR INCOME BEFORE INCOME TAXES. IN FISCAL YEARS 2013 AND 2012, THE FOREIGN INCOME BEFORE\nINCOME TAXES WAS $20.4 BILLION AND $20.7 BILLION, RESPECTIVELY, AND COMPRISED 75% AND 93%, RESPECTIVELY, OF OUR INCOME BEFORE INCOME TAXES. THE PRIMARY DRIVER FOR THE INCREASE IN THE U.S. INCOME BEFORE INCOME TAX IN FISCAL YEAR 2013 WAS THE GOODWILL\nIMPAIRMENT CHARGE RECORDED DURING THE PRIOR YEAR.\nTAX CONTINGENCIES AND OTHER TAX LIABILITIES WERE $9.4 BILLION AND $7.6 BILLION AS OF\nJUNE 30, 2013 AND 2012, RESPECTIVELY, AND ARE INCLUDED IN OTHER LONG-TERM LIABILITIES. THIS INCREASE RELATES PRIMARILY TO TRANSFER PRICING, INCLUDING TRANSFER PRICING DEVELOPMENTS IN CERTAIN FOREIGN TAX JURISDICTIONS, PRIMARILY DENMARK. WHILE\nWE SETTLED A PORTION OF THE I.R.S. AUDIT FOR TAX YEARS 2004 TO 2006 DURING THE THIRD QUARTER OF FISCAL YEAR 2011, WE REMAIN UNDER AUDIT FOR THOSE YEARS. IN FEBRUARY 2012, THE I.R.S. WITHDREW ITS 2011 REVENUE AGENTS REPORT AND REOPENED THE AUDIT\nPHASE OF THE EXAMINATION. AS OF JUNE 30, 2013, THE PRIMARY UNRESOLVED ISSUE RELATES TO TRANSFER PRICING WHICH COULD HAVE A SIGNIFICANT IMPACT ON OUR FINANCIAL STATEMENTS IF NOT RESOLVED FAVORABLY. WE DO NOT BELIEVE IT IS REASONABLY POSSIBLE\nTHAT THE TOTAL AMOUNT OF UNRECOGNIZED TAX BENEFITS WILL SIGNIFICANTLY INCREASE OR DECREASE WITHIN THE NEXT 12 MONTHS BECAUSE WE DO NOT BELIEVE THE REMAINING OPEN ISSUES WILL BE RESOLVED WITHIN THE NEXT 12 MONTHS. WE ALSO CONTINUE TO BE SUBJECT TO\nEXAMINATION BY THE I.R.S. FOR TAX YEARS 2007 TO 2012.\nWE ARE SUBJECT TO INCOME TAX IN MANY JURISDICTIONS OUTSIDE THE U.S. OUR\nOPERATIONS IN CERTAIN JURISDICTIONS REMAIN SUBJECT TO EXAMINATION FOR TAX YEARS 1996 TO 2012, SOME OF WHICH ARE CURRENTLY UNDER AUDIT BY LOCAL TAX AUTHORITIES. THE RESOLUTIONS OF THESE AUDITS ARE NOT EXPECTED TO BE MATERIAL TO OUR FINANCIAL\nSTATEMENTS.\nFISCAL YEAR 2012 COMPARED WITH FISCAL YEAR 2011\nOUR EFFECTIVE TAX RATES FOR FISCAL YEARS 2012 AND 2011 WERE APPROXIMATELY 24% AND 18%, RESPECTIVELY. OUR EFFECTIVE TAX RATES WERE LOWER THAN THE U.S. FEDERAL STATUTORY RATE PRIMARILY DUE TO EARNINGS TAXED AT LOWER\nRATES IN FOREIGN JURISDICTIONS RESULTING FROM PRODUCING AND DISTRIBUTING OUR PRODUCTS AND SERVICES THROUGH OUR FOREIGN REGIONAL OPERATIONS CENTERS IN IRELAND, SINGAPORE, AND PUERTO RICO.\nOUR FISCAL YEAR 2012 EFFECTIVE RATE INCREASED BY 6% FROM FISCAL YEAR 2011 MAINLY DUE TO A NONRECURRING $6.2 BILLION NON-TAX DEDUCTIBLE GOODWILL\nIMPAIRMENT CHARGE THAT WAS RECORDED IN THE FOURTH QUARTER OF 2012. THE GOODWILL IMPAIRMENT CHARGE INCREASED OUR EFFECTIVE TAX RATE BY 10%. IN ADDITION, IN FISCAL YEARS 2012 AND 2011, WE RECOGNIZED\n36\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nPART II\nITEM 7\nA REDUCTION OF 21% AND 16%, RESPECTIVELY, TO THE EFFECTIVE TAX RATE DUE TO FOREIGN EARNINGS TAXED AT LOWER RATES. IN FISCAL YEAR 2011, WE SETTLED A PORTION OF AN I.R.S. AUDIT OF TAX YEARS 2004 TO\n2006, WHICH REDUCED OUR INCOME TAX EXPENSE FOR FISCAL YEAR 2011 BY $461 MILLION AND REDUCED THE EFFECTIVE TAX RATE BY 2%.\nCHANGES IN\nTHE MIX OF INCOME BEFORE INCOME TAXES BETWEEN THE U.S. AND FOREIGN COUNTRIES ALSO IMPACTED OUR EFFECTIVE TAX RATES AND RESULTED PRIMARILY FROM CHANGES IN THE GEOGRAPHIC DISTRIBUTION OF AND CHANGES IN CONSUMER DEMAND FOR OUR PRODUCTS AND SERVICES. AS\nDISCUSSED ABOVE, WINDOWS DIVISION OPERATING INCOME DECLINED $751 MILLION IN FISCAL YEAR 2012, WHILE MBD AND SERVER AND TOOLS OPERATING INCOME INCREASED $1.1 BILLION AND $1.1 BILLION, RESPECTIVELY, DURING THIS SAME PERIOD. WE SUPPLY\nWINDOWS, OUR PRIMARY WINDOWS DIVISION PRODUCT, TO CUSTOMERS THROUGH OUR U.S. REGIONAL OPERATING CENTER, WHILE WE SUPPLY THE MICROSOFT OFFICE SYSTEM, OUR PRIMARY MBD PRODUCT, AND OUR SERVER AND TOOLS PRODUCTS TO CUSTOMERS THROUGH OUR FOREIGN REGIONAL\nOPERATIONS CENTERS. IN FISCAL YEARS 2012 AND 2011, OUR U.S. INCOME BEFORE INCOME TAXES WAS $1.6 BILLION AND $8.9 BILLION, RESPECTIVELY, AND COMPRISED 7% AND 32%, RESPECTIVELY, OF OUR INCOME BEFORE INCOME TAXES. IN FISCAL YEARS 2012 AND 2011, THE\nFOREIGN INCOME BEFORE INCOME TAXES WAS $20.7 BILLION AND $19.2 BILLION, RESPECTIVELY, AND COMPRISED 93% AND 68%, RESPECTIVELY, OF OUR INCOME BEFORE INCOME TAXES. THE PRIMARY DRIVER FOR THE DECREASE IN THE U.S. INCOME BEFORE INCOME TAX IN FISCAL YEAR\n2012 WAS THE GOODWILL IMPAIRMENT CHARGE.\nFINANCIAL CONDITION\nCASH, CASH EQUIVALENTS, AND INVESTMENTS\nCASH, CASH EQUIVALENTS, AND SHORT-TERM INVESTMENTS\nTOTALED $77.0 BILLION AS OF JUNE 30, 2013, COMPARED WITH $63.0 BILLION AS OF JUNE 30, 2012. EQUITY AND OTHER INVESTMENTS WERE $10.8 BILLION AS OF JUNE 30, 2013, COMPARED WITH $9.8 BILLION AS OF JUNE 30, 2012. OUR SHORT-TERM\nINVESTMENTS ARE PRIMARILY TO FACILITATE LIQUIDITY AND FOR CAPITAL PRESERVATION. THEY CONSIST PREDOMINANTLY OF HIGHLY LIQUID INVESTMENT-GRADE FIXED-INCOME SECURITIES, DIVERSIFIED AMONG INDUSTRIES AND INDIVIDUAL ISSUERS. THE INVESTMENTS ARE\nPREDOMINANTLY U.S. DOLLAR-DENOMINATED SECURITIES, BUT ALSO INCLUDE FOREIGN CURRENCY-DENOMINATED SECURITIES IN ORDER TO DIVERSIFY RISK. OUR FIXED-INCOME INVESTMENTS ARE EXPOSED TO INTEREST RATE RISK AND CREDIT RISK. THE CREDIT RISK AND AVERAGE\nMATURITY OF OUR FIXED-INCOME PORTFOLIO ARE MANAGED TO ACHIEVE ECONOMIC RETURNS THAT CORRELATE TO CERTAIN FIXED-INCOME INDICES. THE SETTLEMENT RISK RELATED TO THESE INVESTMENTS IS INSIGNIFICANT GIVEN THAT THE SHORT-TERM INVESTMENTS HELD ARE PRIMARILY\nHIGHLY LIQUID INVESTMENT-GRADE FIXED-INCOME SECURITIES. WHILE WE OWN CERTAIN MORTGAGE-BACKED AND ASSET-BACKED FIXED-INCOME SECURITIES, OUR PORTFOLIO AS OF JUNE 30, 2013 DOES NOT CONTAIN MATERIAL DIRECT EXPOSURE TO SUBPRIME MORTGAGES OR\nSTRUCTURED VEHICLES THAT DERIVE THEIR VALUE FROM SUBPRIME COLLATERAL. THE MAJORITY OF OUR MORTGAGE-BACKED SECURITIES ARE COLLATERALIZED BY PRIME RESIDENTIAL MORTGAGES AND CARRY A 100% PRINCIPAL AND INTEREST GUARANTEE, PRIMARILY FROM FEDERAL NATIONAL\nMORTGAGE ASSOCIATION, FEDERAL HOME LOAN MORTGAGE CORPORATION, AND GOVERNMENT NATIONAL MORTGAGE ASSOCIATION.\nWE ROUTINELY MONITOR OUR\nFINANCIAL EXPOSURE TO BOTH SOVEREIGN AND NON-SOVEREIGN BORROWERS AND COUNTERPARTIES. OUR GROSS EXPOSURES TO OUR CUSTOMERS AND INVESTMENTS IN PORTUGAL, ITALY, IRELAND, GREECE, AND SPAIN ARE INDIVIDUALLY AND COLLECTIVELY NOT MATERIAL.\nOF THE CASH, CASH EQUIVALENTS, AND SHORT-TERM INVESTMENTS AT JUNE 30, 2013, APPROXIMATELY $69.6 BILLION WAS HELD BY OUR FOREIGN SUBSIDIARIES\nAND WOULD BE SUBJECT TO MATERIAL REPATRIATION TAX EFFECTS. THE AMOUNT OF CASH, CASH EQUIVALENTS, AND SHORT-TERM INVESTMENTS HELD BY FOREIGN SUBSIDIARIES SUBJECT TO OTHER RESTRICTIONS ON THE FREE FLOW OF FUNDS (PRIMARILY CURRENCY AND OTHER LOCAL\nREGULATORY) WAS APPROXIMATELY $880 MILLION. AS OF JUNE 30, 2013, APPROXIMATELY 87% OF THE CASH EQUIVALENTS AND SHORT-TERM INVESTMENTS HELD BY OUR FOREIGN SUBSIDIARIES WERE INVESTED IN U.S. GOVERNMENT AND AGENCY SECURITIES, APPROXIMATELY 4% WERE\nINVESTED IN CORPORATE NOTES AND BONDS OF U.S. COMPANIES, AND 2% WERE INVESTED IN U.S. MORTGAGE-BACKED SECURITIES, ALL OF WHICH ARE DENOMINATED IN U.S. DOLLARS.\nSECURITIES LENDING\nWE LEND CERTAIN FIXED-INCOME AND EQUITY SECURITIES TO INCREASE INVESTMENT\nRETURNS. THE LOANED SECURITIES CONTINUE TO BE CARRIED AS INVESTMENTS ON OUR BALANCE SHEET. CASH AND\/OR SECURITY INTERESTS ARE RECEIVED AS COLLATERAL FOR THE LOANED SECURITIES WITH THE AMOUNT DETERMINED BASED UPON THE UNDERLYING SECURITY LENT AND THE\nCREDITWORTHINESS OF\n37\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nPART II\nITEM 7\nTHE BORROWER. CASH RECEIVED IS RECORDED AS AN ASSET WITH A CORRESPONDING LIABILITY. OUR SECURITIES LENDING PAYABLE BALANCE WAS $645 MILLION AS OF JUNE 30, 2013. OUR AVERAGE AND MAXIMUM\nSECURITIES LENDING PAYABLE BALANCES FOR THE FISCAL YEAR WERE $494 MILLION AND $1.4 BILLION, RESPECTIVELY. INTRA-YEAR VARIANCES IN THE AMOUNT OF SECURITIES LOANED ARE MAINLY DUE TO FLUCTUATIONS IN THE DEMAND FOR THE SECURITIES.\nVALUATION\nIN GENERAL, AND WHERE\nAPPLICABLE, WE USE QUOTED PRICES IN ACTIVE MARKETS FOR IDENTICAL ASSETS OR LIABILITIES TO DETERMINE THE FAIR VALUE OF OUR FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS. THIS PRICING METHODOLOGY APPLIES TO OUR LEVEL 1 INVESTMENTS, SUCH AS EXCHANGE-TRADED MUTUAL FUNDS,\nDOMESTIC AND INTERNATIONAL EQUITIES, AND U.S. GOVERNMENT SECURITIES. IF QUOTED PRICES IN ACTIVE MARKETS FOR IDENTICAL ASSETS OR LIABILITIES ARE NOT AVAILABLE TO DETERMINE FAIR VALUE, THEN WE USE QUOTED PRICES FOR SIMILAR ASSETS AND LIABILITIES OR\nINPUTS OTHER THAN THE QUOTED PRICES THAT ARE OBSERVABLE EITHER DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY. THIS PRICING METHODOLOGY APPLIES TO OUR LEVEL 2 INVESTMENTS SUCH AS CORPORATE NOTES AND BONDS, FOREIGN GOVERNMENT BONDS, MORTGAGE-BACKED SECURITIES, AND U.S.\nAGENCY SECURITIES. LEVEL 3 INVESTMENTS ARE VALUED USING INTERNALLY DEVELOPED MODELS WITH UNOBSERVABLE INPUTS. ASSETS AND LIABILITIES MEASURED USING UNOBSERVABLE INPUTS ARE AN IMMATERIAL PORTION OF OUR PORTFOLIO.\nA MAJORITY OF OUR INVESTMENTS ARE PRICED BY PRICING VENDORS AND ARE GENERALLY LEVEL 1 OR LEVEL 2 INVESTMENTS AS THESE VENDORS EITHER PROVIDE A\nQUOTED MARKET PRICE IN AN ACTIVE MARKET OR USE OBSERVABLE INPUTS FOR THEIR PRICING WITHOUT APPLYING SIGNIFICANT ADJUSTMENTS. BROKER PRICING IS USED MAINLY WHEN A QUOTED PRICE IS NOT AVAILABLE, THE INVESTMENT IS NOT PRICED BY OUR PRICING VENDORS, OR\nWHEN A BROKER PRICE IS MORE REFLECTIVE OF FAIR VALUES IN THE MARKET IN WHICH THE INVESTMENT TRADES. OUR BROKER-PRICED INVESTMENTS ARE GENERALLY CLASSIFIED AS LEVEL 2 INVESTMENTS BECAUSE THE BROKER PRICES THESE INVESTMENTS BASED ON SIMILAR ASSETS\nWITHOUT APPLYING SIGNIFICANT ADJUSTMENTS. IN ADDITION, ALL OF OUR BROKER-PRICED INVESTMENTS HAVE A SUFFICIENT LEVEL OF TRADING VOLUME TO DEMONSTRATE THAT THE FAIR VALUES USED ARE APPROPRIATE FOR THESE INVESTMENTS. OUR FAIR VALUE PROCESSES INCLUDE\nCONTROLS THAT ARE DESIGNED TO ENSURE APPROPRIATE FAIR VALUES ARE RECORDED. THESE CONTROLS INCLUDE MODEL VALIDATION, REVIEW OF KEY MODEL INPUTS, ANALYSIS OF PERIOD-OVER-PERIOD FLUCTUATIONS, AND INDEPENDENT RECALCULATION OF PRICES WHERE APPROPRIATE.\nCASH FLOWS\nFISCAL YEAR 2013 COMPARED WITH\nFISCAL YEAR 2012\nCASH FLOWS FROM OPERATIONS DECREASED $2.8 BILLION DURING THE CURRENT FISCAL YEAR TO $28.8 BILLION, DUE MAINLY TO\nCHANGES IN WORKING CAPITAL, INCLUDING INCREASES IN INVENTORY AND OTHER CURRENT ASSETS.

ADDITIONS TO\nPROPERTY AND EQUIPMENT WILL CONTINUE, INCLUDING NEW FACILITIES, DATA CENTERS, AND COMPUTER SYSTEMS FOR RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT, SALES AND MARKETING, SUPPORT, AND ADMINISTRATIVE STAFF. WE EXPECT CAPITAL EXPENDITURES TO INCREASE IN COMING YEARS IN\nSUPPORT OF OUR CLOUD AND DEVICES STRATEGY. WE HAVE OPERATING LEASES FOR MOST U.S. AND INTERNATIONAL SALES AND SUPPORT OFFICES AND CERTAIN EQUIPMENT. WE HAVE NOT ENGAGED IN ANY RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS OR ARRANGEMENTS WITH UNCONSOLIDATED ENTITIES\nOR OTHER PERSONS THAT ARE REASONABLY LIKELY TO MATERIALLY AFFECT LIQUIDITY OR THE AVAILABILITY OF CAPITAL RESOURCES.\nLIQUIDITY\nWE EARN A SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT OF OUR OPERATING INCOME OUTSIDE THE U.S., WHICH IS DEEMED TO BE PERMANENTLY REINVESTED IN FOREIGN JURISDICTIONS. AS A\nRESULT, AS DISCUSSED ABOVE UNDER CASH, CASH EQUIVALENTS, AND INVESTMENTS, THE MAJORITY OF OUR CASH, CASH EQUIVALENTS, AND SHORT-TERM INVESTMENTS ARE HELD BY FOREIGN SUBSIDIARIES. WE CURRENTLY DO NOT INTEND NOR FORESEE A NEED TO REPATRIATE THESE\nFUNDS. WE EXPECT EXISTING DOMESTIC CASH, CASH EQUIVALENTS, SHORT-TERM INVESTMENTS, AND CASH FLOWS FROM OPERATIONS TO CONTINUE TO BE SUFFICIENT TO FUND OUR DOMESTIC OPERATING ACTIVITIES AND CASH COMMITMENTS FOR INVESTING AND FINANCING ACTIVITIES,\nSUCH AS REGULAR QUARTERLY DIVIDENDS, DEBT REPAYMENT SCHEDULES, AND MATERIAL CAPITAL EXPENDITURES, FOR AT LEAST THE NEXT 12 MONTHS AND THEREAFTER FOR THE FORESEEABLE FUTURE. IN ADDITION, WE EXPECT EXISTING FOREIGN CASH, CASH EQUIVALENTS, SHORT-TERM\nINVESTMENTS, AND CASH FLOWS FROM OPERATIONS TO CONTINUE TO BE SUFFICIENT TO FUND OUR FOREIGN OPERATING ACTIVITIES AND CASH COMMITMENTS FOR INVESTING ACTIVITIES, SUCH AS MATERIAL CAPITAL EXPENDITURES, FOR AT LEAST THE NEXT 12 MONTHS AND THEREAFTER\nFOR THE FORESEEABLE FUTURE.\nSHOULD WE REQUIRE MORE CAPITAL IN THE U.S. THAN IS GENERATED BY OUR OPERATIONS DOMESTICALLY, FOR EXAMPLE TO\nFUND SIGNIFICANT DISCRETIONARY ACTIVITIES, SUCH AS BUSINESS ACQUISITIONS AND SHARE REPURCHASES, WE COULD ELECT TO REPATRIATE FUTURE EARNINGS FROM FOREIGN JURISDICTIONS OR RAISE CAPITAL IN THE U.S. THROUGH DEBT OR EQUITY ISSUANCES. THESE ALTERNATIVES\nCOULD RESULT IN HIGHER EFFECTIVE TAX RATES, INCREASED INTEREST EXPENSE, OR DILUTION OF OUR EARNINGS. WE HAVE BORROWED FUNDS DOMESTICALLY AND CONTINUE TO BELIEVE WE HAVE THE ABILITY TO DO SO AT REASONABLE INTEREST RATES.\nRECENT ACCOUNTING GUIDANCE\nRECENTLY\nADOPTED ACCOUNTING GUIDANCE\nIN SEPTEMBER 2011, THE FINANCIAL ACCOUNTING STANDARDS BOARD (\u0093FASB\u0094) ISSUED GUIDANCE ON\nTESTING GOODWILL FOR IMPAIRMENT. THE NEW GUIDANCE PROVIDES AN ENTITY THE OPTION TO FIRST PERFORM A QUALITATIVE ASSESSMENT TO DETERMINE WHETHER IT IS MORE LIKELY THAN NOT THAT THE FAIR VALUE OF A REPORTING UNIT IS LESS THAN ITS CARRYING AMOUNT. IF AN\nENTITY DETERMINES THAT THIS IS THE CASE, IT IS REQUIRED TO PERFORM THE TWO-STEP GOODWILL IMPAIRMENT TEST TO IDENTIFY POTENTIAL GOODWILL IMPAIRMENT AND MEASURE THE AMOUNT OF GOODWILL IMPAIRMENT LOSS TO BE RECOGNIZED FOR THAT REPORTING UNIT (IF ANY).\nIF AN ENTITY DETERMINES THAT THE FAIR VALUE OF A REPORTING UNIT IS GREATER THAN ITS CARRYING AMOUNT, THE TWO-STEP GOODWILL IMPAIRMENT TEST IS NOT REQUIRED. WE ADOPTED THIS NEW GUIDANCE BEGINNING JULY 1, 2012. ADOPTION OF THIS NEW GUIDANCE DID\nNOT HAVE A MATERIAL IMPACT ON OUR FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.\nIN JUNE 2011, THE FASB ISSUED GUIDANCE ON PRESENTATION OF COMPREHENSIVE\nINCOME. THE NEW GUIDANCE ELIMINATED THE OPTION TO REPORT OTHER COMPREHENSIVE INCOME (\u0093OCI\u0094) AND ITS COMPONENTS IN THE STATEMENT OF CHANGES IN STOCKHOLDERS\u0092 EQUITY. INSTEAD, AN ENTITY IS REQUIRED TO PRESENT EITHER A\nCONTINUOUS STATEMENT OF NET INCOME AND OCI OR IN TWO SEPARATE BUT CONSECUTIVE STATEMENTS. WE ADOPTED THIS NEW GUIDANCE BEGINNING JULY 1, 2012. ADOPTION OF THIS NEW GUIDANCE RESULTED ONLY IN CHANGES TO PRESENTATION OF OUR FINANCIAL\nSTATEMENTS.\n42\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nPART II\nITEM 7\nRECENT ACCOUNTING GUIDANCE NOT YET ADOPTED\nIN DECEMBER 2011, THE FASB ISSUED GUIDANCE ENHANCING DISCLOSURE REQUIREMENTS ABOUT THE NATURE OF AN ENTITY\u0092S RIGHT TO OFFSET AND RELATED\nARRANGEMENTS ASSOCIATED WITH ITS FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS AND DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS. THE NEW GUIDANCE REQUIRES THE DISCLOSURE OF THE GROSS AMOUNTS SUBJECT TO RIGHTS OF SET-OFF, AMOUNTS OFFSET IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE ACCOUNTING STANDARDS FOLLOWED, AND\nTHE RELATED NET EXPOSURE. IN JANUARY 2013, THE FASB CLARIFIED THAT THE SCOPE OF THIS GUIDANCE APPLIES TO DERIVATIVES, INCLUDING BIFURCATED EMBEDDED DERIVATIVES, REPURCHASE AGREEMENTS AND REVERSE REPURCHASE AGREEMENTS, AND SECURITIES BORROWING AND\nSECURITIES LENDING TRANSACTIONS THAT ARE EITHER OFFSET OR SUBJECT TO AN ENFORCEABLE MASTER NETTING ARRANGEMENT, OR SIMILAR AGREEMENTS. THE NEW GUIDANCE WILL BE EFFECTIVE FOR US BEGINNING JULY 1, 2013. OTHER THAN REQUIRING ADDITIONAL\nDISCLOSURES, WE DO NOT ANTICIPATE MATERIAL IMPACTS ON OUR FINANCIAL STATEMENTS UPON ADOPTION.\nIN FEBRUARY 2013, THE FASB ISSUED\nGUIDANCE ON DISCLOSURE REQUIREMENTS FOR ITEMS RECLASSIFIED OUT OF ACCUMULATED OTHER COMPREHENSIVE INCOME (\u0093AOCI\u0094). THIS NEW GUIDANCE REQUIRES ENTITIES TO PRESENT (EITHER ON THE FACE OF THE INCOME STATEMENT OR IN THE NOTES) THE EFFECTS ON\nTHE LINE ITEMS OF THE INCOME STATEMENT FOR AMOUNTS RECLASSIFIED OUT OF AOCI. THE NEW GUIDANCE WILL BE EFFECTIVE FOR US BEGINNING JULY 1, 2013. OTHER THAN REQUIRING ADDITIONAL DISCLOSURES, WE DO NOT ANTICIPATE MATERIAL IMPACTS ON OUR FINANCIAL\nSTATEMENTS UPON ADOPTION.\nIN MARCH 2013, THE FASB ISSUED GUIDANCE ON A PARENT\u0092S ACCOUNTING FOR THE CUMULATIVE TRANSLATION\nADJUSTMENT UPON DERECOGNITION OF A SUBSIDIARY OR GROUP OF ASSETS WITHIN A FOREIGN ENTITY. THIS NEW GUIDANCE REQUIRES THAT THE PARENT RELEASE ANY RELATED CUMULATIVE TRANSLATION ADJUSTMENT INTO NET INCOME ONLY IF THE SALE OR TRANSFER RESULTS IN THE\nCOMPLETE OR SUBSTANTIALLY COMPLETE LIQUIDATION OF THE FOREIGN ENTITY IN WHICH THE SUBSIDIARY OR GROUP OF ASSETS HAD RESIDED. THE NEW GUIDANCE WILL BE EFFECTIVE FOR US BEGINNING JULY 1, 2014. WE DO NOT ANTICIPATE MATERIAL IMPACTS ON OUR\nFINANCIAL STATEMENTS UPON ADOPTION.\nAPPLICATION OF CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES\nOUR FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND ACCOMPANYING NOTES ARE PREPARED IN ACCORDANCE WITH U.S. GAAP. PREPARING FINANCIAL STATEMENTS REQUIRES MANAGEMENT TO\nMAKE ESTIMATES AND ASSUMPTIONS THAT AFFECT THE REPORTED AMOUNTS OF ASSETS, LIABILITIES, REVENUE, AND EXPENSES. THESE ESTIMATES AND ASSUMPTIONS ARE AFFECTED BY MANAGEMENT\u0092S APPLICATION OF ACCOUNTING POLICIES. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES FOR US\nINCLUDE REVENUE RECOGNITION, IMPAIRMENT OF INVESTMENT SECURITIES, GOODWILL, RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT COSTS, CONTINGENCIES, INCOME TAXES, AND INVENTORIES.\nREVENUE RECOGNITION\nREVENUE RECOGNITION\nREQUIRES JUDGMENT, INCLUDING WHETHER A SOFTWARE ARRANGEMENT INCLUDES MULTIPLE ELEMENTS, AND IF SO, WHETHER THE VENDOR-SPECIFIC OBJECTIVE EVIDENCE (\u0093VSOE\u0094) OF FAIR VALUE EXISTS FOR THOSE ELEMENTS. A PORTION OF REVENUE MAY BE RECORDED AS\nUNEARNED DUE TO UNDELIVERED ELEMENTS. CHANGES TO THE ELEMENTS IN A SOFTWARE ARRANGEMENT, THE ABILITY TO IDENTIFY THE VSOE FOR THOSE ELEMENTS, AND THE FAIR VALUE OF THE RESPECTIVE ELEMENTS COULD MATERIALLY IMPACT THE AMOUNT OF EARNED AND UNEARNED\nREVENUE. JUDGMENT IS ALSO REQUIRED TO ASSESS WHETHER FUTURE RELEASES OF CERTAIN SOFTWARE REPRESENT NEW PRODUCTS OR UPGRADES AND ENHANCEMENTS TO EXISTING PRODUCTS. CERTAIN VOLUME LICENSING ARRANGEMENTS INCLUDE A PERPETUAL LICENSE FOR CURRENT PRODUCTS\nCOMBINED WITH RIGHTS TO RECEIVE UNSPECIFIED FUTURE VERSIONS OF SOFTWARE PRODUCTS (\u0093SOFTWARE ASSURANCE\u0094) AND ARE ACCOUNTED FOR AS SUBSCRIPTIONS, WITH BILLINGS RECORDED AS UNEARNED REVENUE AND RECOGNIZED AS REVENUE RATABLY OVER THE COVERAGE\nPERIOD.\nSOFTWARE UPDATES ARE EVALUATED ON A CASE-BY-CASE BASIS TO DETERMINE WHETHER THEY MEET THE DEFINITION OF AN UPGRADE, WHICH MAY\nREQUIRE REVENUE TO BE DEFERRED AND RECOGNIZED WHEN THE UPGRADE IS DELIVERED, OR IF IT IS DETERMINED THAT IMPLIED POST-CONTRACT CUSTOMER SUPPORT (\u0093PCS\u0094) IS BEING PROVIDED, REVENUE FROM THE ARRANGEMENT IS DEFERRED AND RECOGNIZED OVER THE\nIMPLIED PCS TERM. IF UPDATES ARE DETERMINED TO NOT MEET THE DEFINITION OF AN UPGRADE, REVENUE IS GENERALLY RECOGNIZED AS PRODUCTS ARE SHIPPED OR MADE AVAILABLE.\nWINDOWS 8.1 WILL ENABLE NEW HARDWARE, FURTHER THE INTEGRATION WITH OTHER MICROSOFT SERVICES AND ADDRESS CUSTOMER ISSUES WITH WINDOWS 8, AND WILL BE PROVIDED TO WINDOWS 8 CUSTOMERS WHEN AVAILABLE AT NO ADDITIONAL\nCHARGE. WE EVALUATED WINDOWS 8.1 AND DETERMINED THAT IT DID NOT MEET THE DEFINITION OF AN UPGRADE AND THUS HAVE NOT DEFERRED REVENUE RELATED TO THIS PLANNED RELEASE.\n43\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nPART II\nITEM 7\nWINDOWS 7 REVENUE WAS SUBJECT TO DEFERRAL AS A RESULT OF THE WINDOWS UPGRADE OFFER, WHICH STARTED\nJUNE 2, 2012. THE OFFER PROVIDED SIGNIFICANTLY DISCOUNTED RIGHTS TO PURCHASE WINDOWS 8 PRO TO QUALIFYING END-USERS THAT PURCHASED WINDOWS 7 PCS DURING THE ELIGIBILITY PERIOD. MICROSOFT WAS RESPONSIBLE FOR DELIVERING WINDOWS 8 PRO TO THE END\nCUSTOMER. ACCORDINGLY, REVENUE RELATED TO THE ALLOCATED DISCOUNT FOR UNDELIVERED WINDOWS 8 WAS DEFERRED UNTIL IT WAS DELIVERED OR THE REDEMPTION PERIOD EXPIRED.\nMICROSOFT OFFICE SYSTEM REVENUE WAS SUBJECT TO DEFERRAL AS A RESULT OF THE OFFICE UPGRADE OFFER, WHICH STARTED OCTOBER 19, 2012. THE OFFICE UPGRADE OFFER ALLOWED CUSTOMERS WHO PURCHASED QUALIFYING 2010\nMICROSOFT OFFICE SYSTEM OR OFFICE FOR MAC 2011 PRODUCTS TO RECEIVE, AT NO COST, A ONE-YEAR SUBSCRIPTION TO OFFICE 365 HOME PREMIUM OR THE EQUIVALENT VERSION OF 2013 MICROSOFT OFFICE SYSTEM UPON GENERAL AVAILABILITY. SMALL BUSINESS CUSTOMERS IN\nAPPLICABLE MARKETS WERE ALSO ELIGIBLE FOR A THREE-MONTH TRIAL OF OFFICE 365 SMALL BUSINESS PREMIUM. ACCORDINGLY, ESTIMATED REVENUE RELATED TO THE UNDELIVERED 2013 MICROSOFT OFFICE SYSTEM AND SUBSCRIPTION SERVICES WAS DEFERRED UNTIL THE PRODUCTS AND\nSERVICES WERE DELIVERED OR THE REDEMPTION PERIOD EXPIRED.\nIMPAIRMENT OF INVESTMENT SECURITIES\nWE REVIEW INVESTMENTS QUARTERLY FOR INDICATORS OF OTHER-THAN-TEMPORARY IMPAIRMENT. THIS DETERMINATION REQUIRES SIGNIFICANT JUDGMENT. IN MAKING THIS\nJUDGMENT, WE EMPLOY A SYSTEMATIC METHODOLOGY QUARTERLY THAT CONSIDERS AVAILABLE QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE EVIDENCE IN EVALUATING POTENTIAL IMPAIRMENT OF OUR INVESTMENTS. IF THE COST OF AN INVESTMENT EXCEEDS ITS FAIR VALUE, WE EVALUATE, AMONG\nOTHER FACTORS, GENERAL MARKET CONDITIONS, CREDIT QUALITY OF DEBT INSTRUMENT ISSUERS, THE DURATION AND EXTENT TO WHICH THE FAIR VALUE IS LESS THAN COST, AND FOR EQUITY SECURITIES, OUR INTENT AND ABILITY TO HOLD, OR PLANS TO SELL, THE INVESTMENT. FOR\nFIXED-INCOME SECURITIES, WE ALSO EVALUATE WHETHER WE HAVE PLANS TO SELL THE SECURITY OR IT IS MORE LIKELY THAN NOT THAT WE WILL BE REQUIRED TO SELL THE SECURITY BEFORE RECOVERY. WE ALSO CONSIDER SPECIFIC ADVERSE CONDITIONS RELATED TO THE FINANCIAL\nHEALTH OF AND BUSINESS OUTLOOK FOR THE INVESTEE, INCLUDING INDUSTRY AND SECTOR PERFORMANCE, CHANGES IN TECHNOLOGY, AND OPERATIONAL AND FINANCING CASH FLOW FACTORS. ONCE A DECLINE IN FAIR VALUE IS DETERMINED TO BE OTHER-THAN-TEMPORARY, AN IMPAIRMENT\nCHARGE IS RECORDED TO OTHER INCOME (EXPENSE) AND A NEW COST BASIS IN THE INVESTMENT IS ESTABLISHED. IF MARKET, INDUSTRY, AND\/OR INVESTEE CONDITIONS DETERIORATE, WE MAY INCUR FUTURE IMPAIRMENTS.\nGOODWILL\nWE ALLOCATE GOODWILL TO REPORTING\nUNITS BASED ON THE REPORTING UNIT EXPECTED TO BENEFIT FROM THE BUSINESS COMBINATION. WE EVALUATE OUR REPORTING UNITS ON AN ANNUAL BASIS AND, IF NECESSARY, REASSIGN GOODWILL USING A RELATIVE FAIR VALUE ALLOCATION APPROACH. GOODWILL IS TESTED FOR\nIMPAIRMENT AT THE REPORTING UNIT LEVEL (OPERATING SEGMENT OR ONE LEVEL BELOW AN OPERATING SEGMENT) ON AN ANNUAL BASIS (MAY 1 FOR US) AND BETWEEN ANNUAL TESTS IF AN EVENT OCCURS OR CIRCUMSTANCES CHANGE THAT WOULD MORE LIKELY THAN NOT REDUCE THE FAIR\nVALUE OF A REPORTING UNIT BELOW ITS CARRYING VALUE. THESE EVENTS OR CIRCUMSTANCES COULD INCLUDE A SIGNIFICANT CHANGE IN THE BUSINESS CLIMATE, LEGAL FACTORS, OPERATING PERFORMANCE INDICATORS, COMPETITION, OR SALE OR DISPOSITION OF A SIGNIFICANT\nPORTION OF A REPORTING UNIT.\nAPPLICATION OF THE GOODWILL IMPAIRMENT TEST REQUIRES JUDGMENT, INCLUDING THE IDENTIFICATION OF REPORTING\nUNITS, ASSIGNMENT OF ASSETS AND LIABILITIES TO REPORTING UNITS, ASSIGNMENT OF GOODWILL TO REPORTING UNITS, AND DETERMINATION OF THE FAIR VALUE OF EACH REPORTING UNIT. THE FAIR VALUE OF EACH REPORTING UNIT IS ESTIMATED USING A DISCOUNTED CASH FLOW\nMETHODOLOGY. THIS ANALYSIS REQUIRES SIGNIFICANT JUDGMENTS, INCLUDING ESTIMATION OF FUTURE CASH FLOWS, WHICH IS DEPENDENT ON INTERNAL FORECASTS, ESTIMATION OF THE LONG-TERM RATE OF GROWTH FOR OUR BUSINESS, ESTIMATION OF THE USEFUL LIFE OVER WHICH\nCASH FLOWS WILL OCCUR, AND DETERMINATION OF OUR WEIGHTED AVERAGE COST OF CAPITAL.\nTHE ESTIMATES USED TO CALCULATE THE FAIR VALUE OF A\nREPORTING UNIT CHANGE FROM YEAR TO YEAR BASED ON OPERATING RESULTS, MARKET CONDITIONS, AND OTHER FACTORS. CHANGES IN THESE ESTIMATES AND ASSUMPTIONS COULD MATERIALLY AFFECT THE DETERMINATION OF FAIR VALUE AND GOODWILL IMPAIRMENT FOR EACH REPORTING\nUNIT.\nRESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT COSTS\nCOSTS INCURRED INTERNALLY IN RESEARCHING AND DEVELOPING A COMPUTER SOFTWARE PRODUCT ARE CHARGED TO EXPENSE UNTIL TECHNOLOGICAL FEASIBILITY HAS BEEN ESTABLISHED FOR THE PRODUCT. ONCE TECHNOLOGICAL FEASIBILITY IS\nESTABLISHED, ALL\n44\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nPART II\nITEM 7\nSOFTWARE COSTS ARE CAPITALIZED UNTIL THE PRODUCT IS AVAILABLE FOR GENERAL RELEASE TO CUSTOMERS. JUDGMENT IS REQUIRED IN DETERMINING WHEN TECHNOLOGICAL FEASIBILITY OF A PRODUCT IS ESTABLISHED. WE\nHAVE DETERMINED THAT TECHNOLOGICAL FEASIBILITY FOR OUR SOFTWARE PRODUCTS IS REACHED AFTER ALL HIGH-RISK DEVELOPMENT ISSUES HAVE BEEN RESOLVED THROUGH CODING AND TESTING. GENERALLY, THIS OCCURS SHORTLY BEFORE THE PRODUCTS ARE RELEASED TO\nMANUFACTURING. THE AMORTIZATION OF THESE COSTS IS INCLUDED IN COST OF REVENUE OVER THE ESTIMATED LIFE OF THE PRODUCTS.\nLEGAL AND OTHER CONTINGENCIES\nTHE OUTCOMES OF LEGAL PROCEEDINGS AND CLAIMS BROUGHT AGAINST US ARE SUBJECT TO SIGNIFICANT UNCERTAINTY. AN ESTIMATED LOSS FROM A\nLOSS CONTINGENCY SUCH AS A LEGAL PROCEEDING OR CLAIM IS ACCRUED BY A CHARGE TO INCOME IF IT IS PROBABLE THAT AN ASSET HAS BEEN IMPAIRED OR A LIABILITY HAS BEEN INCURRED AND THE AMOUNT OF THE LOSS CAN BE REASONABLY ESTIMATED. DISCLOSURE OF A\nCONTINGENCY IS REQUIRED IF THERE IS AT LEAST A REASONABLE POSSIBILITY THAT A LOSS HAS BEEN INCURRED. IN DETERMINING WHETHER A LOSS SHOULD BE ACCRUED WE EVALUATE, AMONG OTHER FACTORS, THE DEGREE OF PROBABILITY OF AN UNFAVORABLE OUTCOME AND THE\nABILITY TO MAKE A REASONABLE ESTIMATE OF THE AMOUNT OF LOSS. CHANGES IN THESE FACTORS COULD MATERIALLY IMPACT OUR FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.\nINCOME TAXES\nTHE OBJECTIVES OF ACCOUNTING FOR INCOME TAXES ARE TO RECOGNIZE THE AMOUNT OF TAXES PAYABLE OR REFUNDABLE FOR THE CURRENT YEAR AND\nDEFERRED TAX LIABILITIES AND ASSETS FOR THE FUTURE TAX CONSEQUENCES OF EVENTS THAT HAVE BEEN RECOGNIZED IN AN ENTITY\u0092S FINANCIAL STATEMENTS OR TAX RETURNS. WE RECOGNIZE THE TAX BENEFIT FROM AN UNCERTAIN TAX POSITION ONLY IF IT IS MORE LIKELY\nTHAN NOT THAT THE TAX POSITION WILL BE SUSTAINED ON EXAMINATION BY THE TAXING AUTHORITIES, BASED ON THE TECHNICAL MERITS OF THE POSITION. THE TAX BENEFITS RECOGNIZED IN THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FROM SUCH A POSITION ARE MEASURED BASED ON THE LARGEST\nBENEFIT THAT HAS A GREATER THAN 50% LIKELIHOOD OF BEING REALIZED UPON ULTIMATE SETTLEMENT. ACCOUNTING LITERATURE ALSO PROVIDES GUIDANCE ON DERECOGNITION OF INCOME TAX ASSETS AND LIABILITIES, CLASSIFICATION OF CURRENT AND DEFERRED INCOME TAX ASSETS\nAND LIABILITIES, ACCOUNTING FOR INTEREST AND PENALTIES ASSOCIATED WITH TAX POSITIONS, AND INCOME TAX DISCLOSURES. JUDGMENT IS REQUIRED IN ASSESSING THE FUTURE TAX CONSEQUENCES OF EVENTS THAT HAVE BEEN RECOGNIZED IN OUR FINANCIAL STATEMENTS OR TAX\nRETURNS. VARIATIONS IN THE ACTUAL OUTCOME OF THESE FUTURE TAX CONSEQUENCES COULD MATERIALLY IMPACT OUR FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.\nINVENTORIES\nINVENTORIES ARE STATED AT AVERAGE COST, SUBJECT TO THE LOWER OF COST OR MARKET. COST INCLUDES MATERIALS, LABOR, AND MANUFACTURING\nOVERHEAD RELATED TO THE PURCHASE AND PRODUCTION OF INVENTORIES. WE REGULARLY REVIEW INVENTORY QUANTITIES ON HAND, FUTURE PURCHASE COMMITMENTS WITH OUR SUPPLIERS, AND THE ESTIMATED UTILITY OF OUR INVENTORY. THESE REVIEWS INCLUDE ANALYSIS OF DEMAND\nFORECASTS, PRODUCT LIFE CYCLE STATUS, PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT PLANS, CURRENT SALES LEVELS, PRICING STRATEGY, AND COMPONENT COST TRENDS. IF OUR REVIEW INDICATES A REDUCTION IN UTILITY BELOW CARRYING VALUE, WE REDUCE OUR INVENTORY TO A NEW COST BASIS\nTHROUGH A CHARGE TO COST OF REVENUE. THE DETERMINATION OF MARKET VALUE AND THE ESTIMATED VOLUME OF DEMAND USED IN THE LOWER OF COST OR MARKET ANALYSIS REQUIRE SIGNIFICANT JUDGMENT.\n45\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nPART II\nITEM 7\nSTATEMENT OF MANAGEMENT\u0092S RESPONSIBILITY FOR FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nMANAGEMENT IS RESPONSIBLE FOR THE PREPARATION OF THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND RELATED INFORMATION THAT ARE PRESENTED IN THIS REPORT.\nTHE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS, WHICH INCLUDE AMOUNTS BASED ON MANAGEMENT\u0092S ESTIMATES AND JUDGMENTS, HAVE BEEN PREPARED IN CONFORMITY WITH ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES GENERALLY ACCEPTED IN THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA.\nTHE COMPANY DESIGNS AND MAINTAINS ACCOUNTING AND INTERNAL CONTROL SYSTEMS TO PROVIDE REASONABLE ASSURANCE AT REASONABLE COST THAT ASSETS ARE\nSAFEGUARDED AGAINST LOSS FROM UNAUTHORIZED USE OR DISPOSITION, AND THAT THE FINANCIAL RECORDS ARE RELIABLE FOR PREPARING FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND MAINTAINING ACCOUNTABILITY FOR ASSETS.

THIS RESULTED FROM GROWTH IN NET SALES OF IPHONE; ITUNES, SOFTWARE, AND SERVICES; AND IPAD.

ALL OF THE COMPANY\u0092S OPERATING SEGMENTS EXPERIENCED INCREASED NET SALES IN 2013, WITH NET SALES GROWTH BEING PARTICULARLY STRONG IN THE AMERICAS, GREATER CHINA\nAND JAPAN OPERATING SEGMENTS. SIMILAR TO 2012, GROWTH IN TOTAL NET SALES WAS HIGHER DURING THE FIRST HALF OF 2013, RISING $12.6 BILLION OR 14.7% OVER THE SAME PERIOD IN 2012. FIRST HALF GROWTH IN 2013 WAS DRIVEN BY IPHONE AND IPAD INTRODUCTIONS AT\nOR NEAR THE BEGINNING OF 2013.\nDURING THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2013, THE COMPANY INTRODUCED THE FOURTH GENERATION IPAD AND IPAD\nMINI, A NEW MACBOOK PRO WITH RETINA DISPLAY, A NEW IPOD TOUCH, A NEW IMAC, AND EXPANDED THE ROLLOUT OF IPHONE 5 WHICH BEGAN IN SEPTEMBER 2012.

ALL OF THE COMPANY\u0092S OPERATING SEGMENTS EXPERIENCED\nINCREASED NET SALES DURING 2012, PRIMARILY A RESULT OF STRONG DEMAND FOR IPHONE AND IPAD. GROWTH IN TOTAL NET SALES WAS PARTICULARLY STRONG DURING THE FIRST SIX MONTHS OF 2012, RISING $34.1 BILLION OR 66% COMPARED TO THE SAME PERIOD IN 2011. THE NET\nSALES GROWTH DURING THE FIRST SIX MONTHS OF 2012 REFLECTED THE LAUNCH OF IPHONE 4S IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2012 AND THE COMPANY\u0092S ABILITY TO MEET DEMAND MORE QUICKLY FOR IPHONE 4S WHEN COMPARED TO THE IPHONE 4 LAUNCH. GROWTH DURING THE FIRST\nHALF OF 2012 WAS ALSO FAVORABLY IMPACTED BY STRONG UNIT SALES OF IPAD DURING THE HOLIDAY SEASON, RESULTING IN A 111% INCREASE IN IPAD UNIT SALES DURING THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2012 COMPARED TO THE SAME QUARTER IN 2011. PARTIALLY OFFSETTING THESE\nPOSITIVE FACTORS WAS A DECREASE IN IPOD NET SALES EXPERIENCED ACROSS ALL OPERATING SEGMENTS.\nIN OCTOBER 2011, THE COMPANY\nINTRODUCED IPHONE 4S AND LAUNCHED ICLOUD, THE COMPANY\u0092S CLOUD SERVICE THAT STORES USER DATA AND KEEPS IT UP TO DATE AND AVAILABLE ON MULTIPLE IOS DEVICES AND MAC AND WINDOWS PERSONAL COMPUTERS.

ALL OF THE COMPANY\u0092S OPERATING SEGMENTS EXPERIENCED INCREASES IN NET SALES AND UNIT\nSALES OF IPHONE DURING 2013 COMPARED TO 2012. THE YEAR-OVER-YEAR IMPACT OF HIGHER IPHONE UNIT SALES IN 2013 WAS PARTIALLY OFFSET BY A 3% DECLINE IN IPHONE AVERAGE SELLING PRICES (\u0093ASPS\u0094) IN 2013 COMPARED TO 2012 PRIMARILY AS A RESULT OF A\nSHIFT IN PRODUCT MIX TOWARDS LOWER-PRICED IPHONE MODELS, PARTICULARLY IPHONE 4. ALL OF THE COMPANY\u0092S GEOGRAPHIC OPERATING SEGMENTS EXPERIENCED A DECLINE IN IPHONE ASPS DURING 2013.\nTHE YEAR-OVER-YEAR GROWTH IN IPHONE NET SALES AND UNIT SALES DURING 2012 REFLECTS STRONG DEMAND FOR IPHONE IN ALL OF THE COMPANY\u0092S\nOPERATING SEGMENTS, EXCEPT FOR THE REST OF ASIA PACIFIC SEGMENT. GROWTH IN IPHONE SALES DURING 2012 IS PRIMARILY A RESULT OF THE LAUNCHES OF IPHONE 4S IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2012 AND IPHONE 5 IN THE FOURTH QUARTER OF 2012, ONGOING DEMAND DURING\n2012 FOR IPHONE 4 AND IPHONE 3GS, AND EXPANDED DISTRIBUTION WITH NEW CARRIERS AND RESELLERS.\nIPAD\nTHE FOLLOWING TABLE PRESENTS IPAD NET SALES AND UNIT SALES INFORMATION FOR 2013, 2012 AND 2011 (NET SALES IN MILLIONS AND UNITS IN\nTHOUSANDS).\n2013\nCHANGE\n2012\nCHANGE\n2011\nNET SALES\n$31,980\n3%\n$30,945\n61%\n$19,168\nPERCENTAGE OF TOTAL NET SALES\n19%\n20%\n18%\nUNIT SALES\n71,033\n22%\n58,310\n80%\n32,394\nTHE GROWTH IN NET SALES AND UNIT SALES OF IPAD DURING 2013 RESULTED FROM GROWTH IN IPAD UNIT SALES IN ALL\nOF THE COMPANY\u0092S OPERATING SEGMENTS. THIS GROWTH WAS DRIVEN BY THE LAUNCH OF IPAD MINI AND THE FOURTH GENERATION IPAD BEGINNING IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2013. THE YEAR-OVER-YEAR GROWTH RATE OF TOTAL IPAD UNIT SALES WAS SIGNIFICANTLY HIGHER THAN\nTHE GROWTH RATE OF TOTAL IPAD NET SALES FOR 2013 DUE TO A REDUCTION IN IPAD ASPS OF 15% IN 2013 COMPARED TO 2012. THIS DECLINE RESULTED PRIMARILY FROM INTRODUCTION OF THE LOWER PRICED IPAD MINI AND THE FULL YEAR IMPACT OF THE PRICE REDUCTION ON IPAD\n2 MADE IN 2012. THE DECLINE IN IPAD ASPS WAS EXPERIENCED TO VARIOUS DEGREES BY ALL OF THE COMPANY\u0092S OPERATING SEGMENTS.\nTHE YEAR-OVER-YEAR INCREASE IN IPAD NET SALES AND UNIT SALES DURING 2012 WAS DRIVEN BY STRONG DEMAND FOR IPAD IN ALL OF THE\nCOMPANY\u0092S OPERATING SEGMENTS AS A RESULT OF THE LAUNCH OF THE THIRD GENERATION IPAD IN MARCH 2012, CONTINUED DEMAND FOR IPAD 2, AND EXPANDED DISTRIBUTION WITH NEW RESELLERS. THE YEAR-OVER-YEAR GROWTH RATE OF IPAD UNIT SALES WAS HIGHER THAN THE\nGROWTH RATE OF IPAD NET SALES DURING 2012 DUE TO A 10% REDUCTION IN ASPS AS A RESULT OF A SHIFT IN PRODUCT MIX TOWARD LOWER-PRICED IPAD MODELS, A PRICE REDUCTION ON IPAD 2 AND AN INCREASE IN INDIRECT SALES DUE TO EXPANDED DISTRIBUTION THROUGH\nTHIRD-PARTY RESELLERS.\n28\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nMAC\nTHE FOLLOWING TABLE PRESENTS MAC NET SALES AND UNIT SALES INFORMATION FOR 2013, 2012 AND 2011 (NET SALES IN MILLIONS AND UNITS IN THOUSANDS).\n2013\nCHANGE\n2012\nCHANGE\n2011\nNET SALES\n$21,483\n(7)%\n$23,221\n7%\n$21,783\nPERCENTAGE OF TOTAL NET SALES\n13%\n15%\n20%\nUNIT SALES\n16,341\n(10)%\n18,158\n9%\n16,735\nMAC NET SALES AND UNIT SALES FOR 2013 WERE DOWN OR RELATIVELY FLAT IN ALL OF THE COMPANY\u0092S OPERATING\nSEGMENTS. MAC ASPS INCREASED SLIGHTLY PARTIALLY OFFSETTING THE IMPACT OF LOWER UNIT SALES ON NET SALES. THE DECLINE IN MAC UNIT SALES AND NET SALES REFLECTS THE OVERALL WEAKNESS IN THE MARKET FOR PERSONAL COMPUTERS.\nTHE YEAR-OVER-YEAR GROWTH IN MAC NET SALES AND UNIT SALES DURING 2012 REFLECTS INCREASED DEMAND FOR MAC PORTABLES IN ALL OF THE\nCOMPANY\u0092S OPERATING SEGMENTS DRIVEN BY 2012 RELEASES OF UPDATED MODELS OF MACBOOK AIR AND MACBOOK PRO, INCLUDING MACBOOK PRO WITH RETINA DISPLAY IN JUNE 2012. PARTIALLY OFFSETTING THE INCREASE IN NET SALES OF MAC PORTABLES WAS A DECLINE IN NET\nSALES OF MAC DESKTOPS THAT REFLECTED THE OVERALL DECLINE IN THE MARKET FOR DESKTOP PERSONAL COMPUTERS DURING 2012. ADDITIONALLY, THE COMPANY DID NOT INTRODUCE UPDATED VERSIONS OF ITS MAC DESKTOP PRODUCTS IN 2012.\nITUNES, SOFTWARE AND SERVICES\nTHE FOLLOWING TABLE PRESENTS NET SALES INFORMATION OF ITUNES, SOFTWARE AND SERVICES FOR 2013, 2012 AND 2011 (IN MILLIONS).\n2013\nCHANGE\n2012\nCHANGE\n2011\nITUNES, SOFTWARE AND SERVICES\n$16,051\n25%\n$12,890\n38%\n$9,373\nPERCENTAGE OF TOTAL NET SALES\n9%\n8%\n9%\nTHE INCREASE IN NET SALES OF ITUNES, SOFTWARE AND SERVICES IN 2013 COMPARED TO 2012 WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO\nGROWTH IN NET SALES FROM THE ITUNES STORE, APPLECARE AND LICENSING. THE ITUNES STORE GENERATED A TOTAL OF $9.3 BILLION IN NET SALES DURING 2013, A 24% INCREASE FROM 2012. GROWTH IN THE ITUNES STORE, WHICH INCLUDES THE APP STORE, THE MAC APP STORE\nAND THE IBOOKS STORE, REFLECTS CONTINUED GROWTH IN THE INSTALLED BASE OF IOS DEVICES, EXPANDED OFFERINGS OF IOS APPS AND RELATED IN-APP PURCHASES, AND EXPANDED OFFERINGS OF ITUNES DIGITAL CONTENT.\nTHE INCREASE IN NET SALES OF ITUNES, SOFTWARE AND SERVICES IN 2012 COMPARED TO 2011 WAS DUE PRIMARILY TO GROWTH OF THE ITUNES STORE,\nWHICH GENERATED TOTAL NET SALES OF $7.5 BILLION FOR 2012 COMPARED TO NET SALES OF $5.4 BILLION DURING 2011. THE STRONG RESULTS OF THE ITUNES STORE IN 2012 REFLECT GROWTH OF THE APP STORE; GROWTH OF THE COMPANY\u0092S CUSTOMER BASE; AND THE CONTINUED\nEXPANSION OF THIRD-PARTY AUDIO, VIDEO AND BOOK CONTENT AVAILABLE FOR SALE OR RENT VIA THE ITUNES STORE.\n29\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nSEGMENT OPERATING PERFORMANCE\nTHE COMPANY MANAGES ITS BUSINESS PRIMARILY ON A GEOGRAPHIC BASIS. ACCORDINGLY, THE COMPANY DETERMINED ITS REPORTABLE OPERATING SEGMENTS,\nWHICH ARE GENERALLY BASED ON THE NATURE AND LOCATION OF ITS CUSTOMERS, TO BE THE AMERICAS, EUROPE, GREATER CHINA, JAPAN, REST OF ASIA PACIFIC AND RETAIL. THE AMERICAS SEGMENT INCLUDES BOTH NORTH AND SOUTH AMERICA. THE EUROPE SEGMENT INCLUDES\nEUROPEAN COUNTRIES, AS WELL AS INDIA, THE MIDDLE EAST AND AFRICA.

THESE INCREASES WERE PARTIALLY OFFSET BY A DECREASE IN NET\nSALES OF IPOD AND MAC AND A DECLINE IN IPAD ASPS.\nTHE GROWTH IN NET SALES DURING 2012 WAS PRIMARILY DRIVEN BY INCREASED\nDEMAND FOR IPHONE FOLLOWING THE LAUNCHES OF IPHONE 4S AND IPHONE 5, STRONG DEMAND FOR THE THIRD GENERATION IPAD AND IPAD 2, AND HIGHER SALES FROM THE ITUNES STORE.\nEUROPE\nTHE FOLLOWING TABLE PRESENTS EUROPE NET SALES INFORMATION FOR 2013,\n2012 AND 2011 (IN MILLIONS).\n2013\nCHANGE\n2012\nCHANGE\n2011\nNET SALES\n$37,883\n4%\n$36,323\n31%\n$27,778\nPERCENTAGE OF TOTAL NET SALES\n22%\n23%\n26%\nSIMILAR TO THE AMERICAS SEGMENT, GROWTH IN NET SALES IN THE EUROPE SEGMENT DURING 2013 WAS PRIMARILY\nDRIVEN BY INCREASED SALES OF IPHONE, IPAD AND HIGHER NET SALES FROM ITUNES. THESE INCREASES WERE PARTIALLY OFFSET BY DECREASES IN NET SALES OF MAC AND IPOD AND A DECLINE IN IPAD ASPS. NET SALES IN THE EUROPE SEGMENT CONTINUE TO BE NEGATIVELY\nIMPACTED BY UNFAVORABLE ECONOMIC CONDITIONS IN PARTS OF THE REGION REFLECTED BY SECOND HALF 2013 NET SALES FALLING 4% COMPARED TO THE SECOND HALF OF 2012, WHICH FOLLOWED AN 11% INCREASE IN NET SALES DURING THE FIRST HALF OF 2013.\nTHE GROWTH IN NET SALES DURING 2012 WAS PRIMARILY DRIVEN BY STRONG DEMAND FOR THE THIRD GENERATION IPAD AND IPAD 2, HIGHER SALES FROM THE\nITUNES STORE AND INCREASED DEMAND FOR IPHONE FROM THE LAUNCH OF IPHONE 4S. IPHONE 5 WAS LAUNCHED IN A LIMITED NUMBER OF COUNTRIES IN THE EUROPE SEGMENT AT THE END OF THE FOURTH QUARTER OF 2012 AND DID NOT CONTRIBUTE TO THE GROWTH IN NET SALES IN THE\nEUROPE SEGMENT TO THE EXTENT IT DID IN OTHER SEGMENTS. LOWER YEAR-OVER-YEAR GROWTH IN NET SALES IN THE EUROPE SEGMENT DURING 2012 COMPARED TO THE COMPANY\u0092S OTHER GEOGRAPHIC SEGMENTS REFLECTS GROWTH IN IPHONE UNIT SALES THAT WAS WELL BELOW THE\nGROWTH RATES EXPERIENCED BY THE COMPANY\u0092S OTHER OPERATING SEGMENTS, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY STRONG GROWTH IN IPAD UNIT SALES. NET SALES IN THE EUROPE\n30\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nSEGMENT WERE ALSO NEGATIVELY IMPACTED BY THE REGION\u0092S UNCERTAIN ECONOMIC CONDITIONS AND THE STRENGTH IN THE U.S. DOLLAR RELATIVE TO SEVERAL EUROPEAN CURRENCIES, INCLUDING THE EURO.\nGREATER CHINA\nTHE FOLLOWING TABLE PRESENTS GREATER CHINA NET SALES INFORMATION FOR 2013, 2012 AND 2011 (IN MILLIONS).\n2013\nCHANGE\n2012\nCHANGE\n2011\nNET SALES\n$25,417\n13%\n$22,533\n78%\n$12,690\nPERCENTAGE OF TOTAL NET SALES\n15%\n14%\n12%\nTHE GROWTH IN NET SALES IN THE GREATER CHINA SEGMENT DURING 2013 RESULTED FROM TWO MAJOR IPHONE\nINTRODUCTIONS DURING THE YEAR, IPHONE 5 IN DECEMBER 2012 AND IPHONE 5C AND IPHONE 5S IN SEPTEMBER 2013. FURTHER CONTRIBUTING TO THE GROWTH IN 2013 WAS THE INTRODUCTION OF THE FOURTH GENERATION IPAD AND IPAD MINI DURING THE SECOND QUARTER OF 2013 AND\nAN INCREASE IN IPHONE CHANNEL INVENTORY AS OF THE END OF 2013 COMPARED TO THE END OF 2012. WHILE NET SALES IN THE CHINA SEGMENT WERE UP 13% FOR ALL OF 2013, NET SALES FOR THE SECOND HALF OF 2013 DECLINED 4% COMPARED TO THE SECOND HALF OF 2012.\nTHE GROWTH IN NET SALES DURING 2012 WAS MAINLY DUE TO INCREASED DEMAND FOR IPHONE FOLLOWING THE LAUNCH OF IPHONE 4S AND\nSTRONG DEMAND FOR THE THIRD GENERATION IPAD AND IPAD 2. GROWTH IN THE GREATER CHINA SEGMENT WAS AFFECTED BY THE TIMING OF IPHONE AND IPAD PRODUCT LAUNCHES.

LOWER YEAR-OVER-YEAR GROWTH IN NET SALES IN THE RETAIL SEGMENT DURING 2012 COMPARED TO THE COMPANY\u0092S OTHER SEGMENTS\nREFLECTS THE SIGNIFICANT GROWTH IN IPAD INDIRECT DISTRIBUTION CHANNEL EXPANSION. WITH AN AVERAGE OF 365 STORES AND 326 STORES DURING 2012 AND 2011, RESPECTIVELY, AVERAGE REVENUE PER STORE INCREASED 19% TO $51.5 MILLION IN 2012 COMPARED TO $43.3\nMILLION IN 2011.\nTHE RETAIL SEGMENT\u0092S OPERATING INCOME WAS $4.0 BILLION, $4.6 BILLION AND $3.1 BILLION DURING 2013,\n2012, AND 2011, RESPECTIVELY. THE YEAR-OVER-YEAR DECREASE IN RETAIL OPERATING INCOME IN 2013 IS PRIMARILY ATTRIBUTABLE TO LOWER GROSS MARGIN SIMILAR TO THAT EXPERIENCED BY THE COMPANY OVERALL, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY HIGHER NET SALES. THE YEAR-OVER-YEAR\nINCREASE IN RETAIL OPERATING INCOME IN 2012 IS PRIMARILY ATTRIBUTABLE TO HIGHER OVERALL NET SALES THAT RESULTED IN SIGNIFICANTLY HIGHER AVERAGE REVENUE PER STORE DURING 2012.\nGROSS MARGIN\nGROSS MARGIN FOR 2013, 2012 AND 2011 ARE AS FOLLOWS (IN\nMILLIONS, EXCEPT GROSS MARGIN PERCENTAGES).\n2013\n2012\n2011\nNET SALES\n$170,910\n$156,508\n$108,249\nCOST OF SALES\n106,606\n87,846\n64,431\nGROSS MARGIN\n$64,304\n$68,662\n$43,818\nGROSS MARGIN PERCENTAGE\n37.6%\n43.9%\n40.5%\nTHE GROSS MARGIN PERCENTAGE IN 2013 WAS 37.6% COMPARED TO 43.9% IN 2012. THE YEAR-OVER-YEAR DECREASE IN\nGROSS MARGIN IN 2013 COMPARED TO 2012 WAS DRIVEN BY MULTIPLE FACTORS INCLUDING INTRODUCTION OF NEW VERSIONS OF EXISTING PRODUCTS WITH HIGHER COST STRUCTURES AND FLAT OR REDUCED PRICING; A SHIFT IN SALES MIX TO PRODUCTS WITH LOWER MARGINS;\nINTRODUCTION OF IPAD MINI WITH GROSS MARGIN SIGNIFICANTLY BELOW THE COMPANY\u0092S AVERAGE PRODUCT MARGINS; HIGHER EXPENSES ASSOCIATED WITH CHANGES TO CERTAIN OF THE COMPANY\u0092S SERVICE POLICIES AND OTHER\n32\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nWARRANTY COSTS; PRICE REDUCTIONS ON CERTAIN PRODUCTS, INCLUDING IPAD 2 AND IPHONE 4; AND UNFAVORABLE IMPACT FROM FOREIGN EXCHANGE FLUCTUATIONS.\nTHE GROSS MARGIN PERCENTAGE IN 2012 WAS 43.9%, COMPARED TO 40.5% IN 2011. THIS YEAR-OVER-YEAR INCREASE IN GROSS MARGIN WAS LARGELY DRIVEN\nBY LOWER COMMODITY AND OTHER PRODUCT COSTS, A HIGHER MIX OF IPHONE SALES, AND IMPROVED LEVERAGE ON FIXED COSTS FROM HIGHER NET SALES. THE INCREASE IN GROSS MARGIN WAS PARTIALLY OFFSET BY THE IMPACT OF A STRONGER U.S. DOLLAR. THE GROSS MARGIN\nPERCENTAGE DURING THE FIRST HALF OF 2012 WAS 45.9% COMPARED TO 41.4% DURING THE SECOND HALF OF 2012. THE PRIMARY DRIVERS OF HIGHER GROSS MARGIN IN THE FIRST HALF OF 2012 COMPARED TO THE SECOND HALF ARE A HIGHER MIX OF IPHONE SALES AND IMPROVED\nLEVERAGE ON FIXED COSTS FROM HIGHER NET SALES. ADDITIONALLY, GROSS MARGIN IN THE SECOND HALF OF 2012 WAS ALSO AFFECTED BY THE INTRODUCTION OF NEW PRODUCTS WITH FLAT PRICING THAT HAVE HIGHER COST STRUCTURES AND DELIVER GREATER VALUE TO\nCUSTOMERS, PRICE REDUCTIONS ON CERTAIN EXISTING PRODUCTS, HIGHER TRANSITION COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH PRODUCT LAUNCHES, AND CONTINUED STRENGTHENING OF THE U.S. DOLLAR; PARTIALLY OFFSET BY LOWER COMMODITY COSTS.\nTHE COMPANY ANTICIPATES GROSS MARGIN DURING THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2014 TO BE BETWEEN 36.5% AND 37.5%. THE FOREGOING STATEMENT REGARDING\nTHE COMPANY\u0092S EXPECTED GROSS MARGIN PERCENTAGE IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2014 IS FORWARD-LOOKING AND COULD DIFFER FROM ACTUAL RESULTS. THE COMPANY\u0092S FUTURE GROSS MARGIN CAN BE IMPACTED BY MULTIPLE FACTORS INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO THOSE\nSET FORTH ABOVE IN PART I, ITEM 1A OF THIS FORM 10-K UNDER THE HEADING \u0093RISK FACTORS\u0094 AND THOSE DESCRIBED IN THIS PARAGRAPH. IN GENERAL, GROSS MARGINS AND MARGINS ON INDIVIDUAL PRODUCTS WILL REMAIN UNDER DOWNWARD PRESSURE DUE TO A VARIETY\nOF FACTORS, INCLUDING CONTINUED INDUSTRY WIDE GLOBAL PRODUCT PRICING PRESSURES, INCREASED COMPETITION, COMPRESSED PRODUCT LIFE CYCLES, PRODUCT TRANSITIONS, POTENTIAL INCREASES IN THE COST OF COMPONENTS, AND POTENTIAL STRENGTHENING OF THE U.S.\nDOLLAR, AS WELL AS POTENTIAL INCREASES IN THE COSTS OF OUTSIDE MANUFACTURING SERVICES AND A POTENTIAL SHIFT IN THE COMPANY\u0092S SALES MIX TOWARDS PRODUCTS WITH LOWER GROSS MARGINS.\nIN RESPONSE TO COMPETITIVE PRESSURES, THE COMPANY EXPECTS\nIT WILL CONTINUE TO TAKE PRODUCT PRICING ACTIONS, WHICH WOULD ADVERSELY AFFECT GROSS MARGINS. GROSS MARGINS COULD ALSO BE AFFECTED BY THE COMPANY\u0092S ABILITY TO MANAGE PRODUCT QUALITY AND WARRANTY COSTS EFFECTIVELY AND TO STIMULATE DEMAND FOR\nCERTAIN OF ITS PRODUCTS. DUE TO THE COMPANY\u0092S SIGNIFICANT INTERNATIONAL OPERATIONS, FINANCIAL RESULTS CAN BE SIGNIFICANTLY AFFECTED IN THE SHORT-TERM BY FLUCTUATIONS IN EXCHANGE RATES.\nOPERATING EXPENSES\nOPERATING EXPENSES FOR 2013, 2012 AND 2011 ARE AS\nFOLLOWS (IN MILLIONS, EXCEPT FOR PERCENTAGES).\n2013\nCHANGE\n2012\nCHANGE\n2011\nRESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT\n$4,475\n32%\n$3,381\n39%\n$2,429\nPERCENTAGE OF TOTAL NET SALES\n3%\n2%\n2%\nSELLING, GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE\n$10,830\n8%\n$10,040\n32%\n$7,599\nPERCENTAGE OF TOTAL NET SALES\n6%\n6%\n7%\nTOTAL OPERATING EXPENSES\n$15,305\n14%\n$13,421\n34%\n$10,028\nPERCENTAGE OF TOTAL NET SALES\n9%\n9%\n9%\nRESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT (\u0093R&D\u0094) EXPENSE\nTHE GROWTH IN R&D EXPENSE WAS DRIVEN BY AN INCREASE IN HEADCOUNT AND RELATED EXPENSES TO SUPPORT EXPANDED R&D ACTIVITIES. ALTHOUGH\nTOTAL R&D EXPENSE INCREASED 32% AND 39% IN 2013 AND 2012, RESPECTIVELY, IT REMAINED FAIRLY CONSISTENT AS A PERCENTAGE OF NET SALES. THE COMPANY CONTINUES TO BELIEVE THAT FOCUSED INVESTMENTS IN R&D ARE CRITICAL TO ITS FUTURE GROWTH AND\nCOMPETITIVE POSITION IN THE MARKETPLACE AND ARE DIRECTLY RELATED TO TIMELY DEVELOPMENT OF NEW AND ENHANCED PRODUCTS THAT ARE CENTRAL TO THE COMPANY\u0092S CORE BUSINESS STRATEGY. AS SUCH, THE COMPANY EXPECTS TO MAKE FURTHER INVESTMENTS IN R&D TO\nREMAIN COMPETITIVE.\nSELLING, GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE (\u0093SG&A\u0094) EXPENSE\nTHE GROWTH IN SG&A DURING 2013 WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO THE COMPANY\u0092S CONTINUED EXPANSION OF ITS RETAIL SEGMENT AND INCREASED\nHEADCOUNT AND RELATED EXPENSES, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY DECREASED SPENDING ON PROFESSIONAL\n33\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nSERVICES. THE GROWTH IN SG&A DURING 2012 WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO THE COMPANY\u0092S CONTINUED EXPANSION OF ITS RETAIL SEGMENT, INCREASED HEADCOUNT AND RELATED EXPENSES, HIGHER SPENDING ON\nPROFESSIONAL SERVICES, MARKETING AND ADVERTISING PROGRAMS, AND INCREASED VARIABLE COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH THE OVERALL GROWTH OF THE COMPANY\u0092S NET SALES.\nOTHER INCOME AND EXPENSE\nOTHER INCOME AND EXPENSE FOR 2013, 2012 AND 2011\nARE AS FOLLOWS (IN MILLIONS).\n2013\nCHANGE\n2012\nCHANGE\n2011\nINTEREST AND DIVIDEND INCOME\n$1,616\n$1,088\n$519\nINTEREST EXPENSE\n(136\n)\n0\n0\nOTHER EXPENSE, NET\n(324\n)\n(566\n)\n(104\n)\nTOTAL OTHER INCOME\/(EXPENSE), NET\n$1,156\n121%\n$522\n26%\n$415\nTHE YEAR-OVER-YEAR INCREASE IN OTHER INCOME AND EXPENSE DURING 2013 WAS DUE PRIMARILY TO HIGHER INTEREST\nAND DIVIDEND INCOME RESULTING FROM THE COMPANY\u0092S HIGHER CASH, CASH EQUIVALENTS AND MARKETABLE SECURITIES BALANCES AND LOWER PREMIUM EXPENSES ON FOREIGN EXCHANGE CONTRACTS, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY INTEREST EXPENSE ON DEBT ISSUED IN THE THIRD QUARTER\nOF 2013 AND REMEASUREMENT LOSSES FROM FOREIGN EXCHANGE RATE MOVEMENTS. THE OVERALL INCREASE IN OTHER INCOME AND EXPENSE IN 2012 COMPARED TO 2011 WAS ATTRIBUTABLE TO HIGHER INTEREST AND DIVIDEND INCOME ON THE COMPANY\u0092S HIGHER CASH, CASH\nEQUIVALENTS AND MARKETABLE SECURITIES BALANCES, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY HIGHER PREMIUM EXPENSES ON FOREIGN EXCHANGE CONTRACTS. THE WEIGHTED AVERAGE INTEREST RATE EARNED BY THE COMPANY ON ITS CASH, CASH EQUIVALENTS AND MARKETABLE SECURITIES WAS 1.03%\nDURING 2013 AND 2012 AND 0.77% DURING 2011. THE COMPANY HAD NO DEBT OUTSTANDING DURING 2012 AND 2011 AND ACCORDINGLY DID NOT INCUR ANY RELATED INTEREST EXPENSE.\nPROVISION FOR INCOME TAXES\nPROVISION FOR INCOME TAXES AND EFFECTIVE TAX\nRATES FOR 2013, 2012 AND 2011 ARE AS FOLLOWS (IN MILLIONS).\n2013\n2012\n2011\nPROVISION FOR INCOME TAXES\n$13,118\n$14,030\n$8,283\nEFFECTIVE TAX RATE\n26.2%\n25.2%\n24.2%\nTHE COMPANY\u0092S EFFECTIVE TAX RATES FOR ALL PERIODS DIFFER FROM THE STATUTORY FEDERAL INCOME TAX RATE\nOF 35% DUE PRIMARILY TO CERTAIN UNDISTRIBUTED FOREIGN EARNINGS, A SUBSTANTIAL PORTION OF WHICH WAS GENERATED BY SUBSIDIARIES ORGANIZED IN IRELAND, FOR WHICH NO U.S. TAXES ARE PROVIDED BECAUSE SUCH EARNINGS ARE INTENDED TO BE INDEFINITELY REINVESTED\nOUTSIDE THE U.S.\nAS OF SEPTEMBER 28, 2013, THE COMPANY HAD DEFERRED TAX ASSETS ARISING FROM DEDUCTIBLE TEMPORARY\nDIFFERENCES, TAX LOSSES, AND TAX CREDITS OF $4.2 BILLION, AND DEFERRED TAX LIABILITIES OF $16.5 BILLION. MANAGEMENT BELIEVES IT IS MORE LIKELY THAN NOT THAT FORECASTED INCOME, INCLUDING INCOME THAT MAY BE GENERATED AS A RESULT OF CERTAIN TAX\nPLANNING STRATEGIES, TOGETHER WITH FUTURE REVERSALS OF EXISTING TAXABLE TEMPORARY DIFFERENCES, WILL BE SUFFICIENT TO FULLY RECOVER THE DEFERRED TAX ASSETS. THE COMPANY WILL CONTINUE TO EVALUATE THE REALIZABILITY OF DEFERRED TAX ASSETS QUARTERLY BY\nASSESSING THE NEED FOR AND AMOUNT OF A VALUATION ALLOWANCE.\nTHE INTERNAL REVENUE SERVICE (THE \u0093IRS\u0094) HAS COMPLETED\nITS FIELD AUDIT OF THE COMPANY\u0092S FEDERAL INCOME TAX RETURNS FOR THE YEARS 2004 THROUGH 2006 AND PROPOSED CERTAIN ADJUSTMENTS.

AT THIS TIME, THE COMPANY IS UNABLE TO MAKE A REASONABLY RELIABLE ESTIMATE OF THE TIMING OF PAYMENTS IN INDIVIDUAL YEARS IN CONNECTION WITH THESE TAX LIABILITIES; THEREFORE, SUCH AMOUNTS ARE NOT INCLUDED IN THE ABOVE\nCONTRACTUAL OBLIGATION TABLE.\nINDEMNIFICATION\nTHE COMPANY GENERALLY DOES NOT INDEMNIFY END-USERS OF ITS OPERATING SYSTEM AND APPLICATION SOFTWARE AGAINST LEGAL CLAIMS THAT THE SOFTWARE INFRINGES THIRD-PARTY INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS. OTHER\nAGREEMENTS ENTERED INTO BY\n37\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nTHE COMPANY SOMETIMES INCLUDE INDEMNIFICATION PROVISIONS UNDER WHICH THE COMPANY COULD BE SUBJECT TO COSTS AND\/OR DAMAGES IN THE EVENT OF AN INFRINGEMENT CLAIM AGAINST THE COMPANY OR AN\nINDEMNIFIED THIRD-PARTY. HOWEVER, THE COMPANY HAS NOT BEEN REQUIRED TO MAKE ANY SIGNIFICANT PAYMENTS RESULTING FROM SUCH AN INFRINGEMENT CLAIM ASSERTED AGAINST IT OR AN INDEMNIFIED THIRD-PARTY. IN THE OPINION OF MANAGEMENT, THERE WAS NOT AT LEAST A\nREASONABLE POSSIBILITY THE COMPANY MAY HAVE INCURRED A MATERIAL LOSS WITH RESPECT TO INDEMNIFICATION OF END-USERS OF ITS OPERATING SYSTEM OR APPLICATION SOFTWARE FOR INFRINGEMENT OF THIRD-PARTY INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS. THE COMPANY DID NOT\nRECORD A LIABILITY FOR INFRINGEMENT COSTS RELATED TO INDEMNIFICATION AS OF SEPTEMBER 28, 2013 OR SEPTEMBER 29, 2012.\nTHE COMPANY HAS ENTERED INTO INDEMNIFICATION AGREEMENTS WITH ITS DIRECTORS AND EXECUTIVE OFFICERS.

IT IS NOT POSSIBLE TO DETERMINE THE MAXIMUM POTENTIAL AMOUNT OF PAYMENTS THE COMPANY COULD BE REQUIRED TO MAKE UNDER THESE AGREEMENTS DUE TO THE LIMITED HISTORY OF PRIOR INDEMNIFICATION CLAIMS AND THE UNIQUE FACTS AND CIRCUMSTANCES\nINVOLVED IN EACH CLAIM. HOWEVER, THE COMPANY MAINTAINS DIRECTORS AND OFFICERS LIABILITY INSURANCE COVERAGE TO REDUCE ITS EXPOSURE TO SUCH OBLIGATIONS, AND PAYMENTS MADE UNDER THESE AGREEMENTS HISTORICALLY HAVE NOT BEEN MATERIAL.\nCRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES\nTHE PREPARATION OF FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND RELATED DISCLOSURES IN CONFORMITY WITH U.S. GENERALLY ACCEPTED ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES (\u0093GAAP\u0094) AND THE COMPANY\u0092S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF ITS\nFINANCIAL CONDITION AND OPERATING RESULTS REQUIRE THE COMPANY\u0092S MANAGEMENT TO MAKE JUDGMENTS, ASSUMPTIONS, AND ESTIMATES THAT AFFECT THE AMOUNTS REPORTED IN ITS CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND ACCOMPANYING NOTES. NOTE 1, \u0093SUMMARY OF\nSIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES\u0094 OF THE NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS IN PART II, ITEM 8 OF THIS FORM 10-K DESCRIBES THE SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND METHODS USED IN THE PREPARATION OF THE COMPANY\u0092S CONSOLIDATED\nFINANCIAL STATEMENTS. MANAGEMENT BASES ITS ESTIMATES ON HISTORICAL EXPERIENCE AND ON VARIOUS OTHER ASSUMPTIONS IT BELIEVES TO BE REASONABLE UNDER THE CIRCUMSTANCES, THE RESULTS OF WHICH FORM THE BASIS FOR MAKING JUDGMENTS ABOUT THE CARRYING VALUES\nOF ASSETS AND LIABILITIES. ACTUAL RESULTS MAY DIFFER FROM THESE ESTIMATES AND SUCH DIFFERENCES MAY BE MATERIAL.\nMANAGEMENT\nBELIEVES THE COMPANY\u0092S CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES ARE THOSE RELATED TO REVENUE RECOGNITION, VALUATION AND IMPAIRMENT OF MARKETABLE SECURITIES, INVENTORY VALUATION AND VALUATION OF MANUFACTURING-RELATED ASSETS AND ESTIMATED\nPURCHASE COMMITMENT CANCELLATION FEES, WARRANTY COSTS, INCOME TAXES, AND LEGAL AND OTHER CONTINGENCIES. MANAGEMENT CONSIDERS THESE POLICIES CRITICAL BECAUSE THEY ARE BOTH IMPORTANT TO THE PORTRAYAL OF THE COMPANY\u0092S FINANCIAL CONDITION AND\nOPERATING RESULTS, AND THEY REQUIRE MANAGEMENT TO MAKE JUDGMENTS AND ESTIMATES ABOUT INHERENTLY UNCERTAIN MATTERS. THE COMPANY\u0092S SENIOR MANAGEMENT HAS REVIEWED THESE CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND RELATED DISCLOSURES WITH THE AUDIT AND\nFINANCE COMMITTEE OF THE COMPANY\u0092S BOARD OF DIRECTORS.\nREVENUE RECOGNITION\nNET SALES CONSIST PRIMARILY OF REVENUE FROM THE SALE OF HARDWARE, SOFTWARE, DIGITAL CONTENT AND APPLICATIONS, PERIPHERALS, AND SERVICE AND\nSUPPORT CONTRACTS. THE COMPANY RECOGNIZES REVENUE WHEN PERSUASIVE EVIDENCE OF AN ARRANGEMENT EXISTS, DELIVERY HAS OCCURRED, THE SALES PRICE IS FIXED OR DETERMINABLE, AND COLLECTION IS PROBABLE. PRODUCT IS CONSIDERED DELIVERED TO THE CUSTOMER ONCE IT\nHAS BEEN SHIPPED AND TITLE AND RISK OF LOSS HAVE BEEN TRANSFERRED. FOR MOST OF THE COMPANY\u0092S PRODUCT SALES, THESE CRITERIA ARE MET AT THE TIME THE PRODUCT IS SHIPPED. FOR ONLINE SALES TO INDIVIDUALS, FOR SOME SALES TO EDUCATION CUSTOMERS IN THE\nU.S., AND FOR CERTAIN OTHER SALES, THE COMPANY DEFERS REVENUE UNTIL THE CUSTOMER RECEIVES THE PRODUCT BECAUSE THE COMPANY RETAINS A PORTION OF THE RISK OF LOSS ON THESE SALES DURING TRANSIT. THE COMPANY RECOGNIZES REVENUE FROM THE SALE OF HARDWARE\nPRODUCTS, SOFTWARE BUNDLED WITH HARDWARE THAT IS ESSENTIAL TO THE FUNCTIONALITY OF THE HARDWARE, AND THIRD-PARTY DIGITAL CONTENT SOLD ON THE ITUNES STORE IN ACCORDANCE WITH GENERAL REVENUE RECOGNITION ACCOUNTING GUIDANCE. THE\n38\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nCOMPANY RECOGNIZES REVENUE IN ACCORDANCE WITH INDUSTRY SPECIFIC SOFTWARE ACCOUNTING GUIDANCE FOR THE FOLLOWING TYPES OF SALES TRANSACTIONS: (I) STANDALONE SALES OF SOFTWARE PRODUCTS,\n(II) SALES OF SOFTWARE UPGRADES AND (III) SALES OF SOFTWARE BUNDLED WITH HARDWARE NOT ESSENTIAL TO THE FUNCTIONALITY OF THE HARDWARE.\nFOR MULTI-ELEMENT ARRANGEMENTS THAT INCLUDE HARDWARE PRODUCTS CONTAINING SOFTWARE ESSENTIAL TO THE HARDWARE PRODUCT\u0092S FUNCTIONALITY, UNDELIVERED SOFTWARE ELEMENTS THAT RELATE TO THE HARDWARE\nPRODUCT\u0092S ESSENTIAL SOFTWARE, AND\/OR UNDELIVERED NON-SOFTWARE SERVICES, THE COMPANY ALLOCATES REVENUE TO ALL DELIVERABLES BASED ON THEIR RELATIVE SELLING PRICES. IN SUCH CIRCUMSTANCES, THE COMPANY USES A HIERARCHY TO DETERMINE THE SELLING PRICE\nTO BE USED FOR ALLOCATING REVENUE TO DELIVERABLES: (I) VENDOR-SPECIFIC OBJECTIVE EVIDENCE OF FAIR VALUE (\u0093VSOE\u0094), (II) THIRD-PARTY EVIDENCE OF SELLING PRICE (\u0093TPE\u0094) AND (III) BEST ESTIMATE OF SELLING PRICE\n(\u0093ESP\u0094). VSOE GENERALLY EXISTS ONLY WHEN THE COMPANY SELLS THE DELIVERABLE SEPARATELY AND IS THE PRICE ACTUALLY CHARGED BY THE COMPANY FOR THAT DELIVERABLE. ESPS REFLECT THE COMPANY\u0092S BEST ESTIMATES OF WHAT THE SELLING PRICES OF\nELEMENTS WOULD BE IF THEY WERE SOLD REGULARLY ON A STAND-ALONE BASIS.\nFOR SALES OF QUALIFYING VERSIONS OF IOS DEVICES, MAC\nAND APPLE TV, THE COMPANY HAS INDICATED IT MAY FROM TIME TO TIME PROVIDE FUTURE UNSPECIFIED SOFTWARE UPGRADES AND FEATURES FREE OF CHARGE TO CUSTOMERS. THE COMPANY ALSO PROVIDES VARIOUS NON-SOFTWARE SERVICES TO OWNERS OF QUALIFYING VERSIONS OF IOS\nDEVICES AND MAC. BECAUSE THE COMPANY HAS NEITHER VSOE NOR TPE FOR THE UNSPECIFIED SOFTWARE UPGRADE RIGHTS OR THE NON-SOFTWARE SERVICES, REVENUE IS ALLOCATED TO THESE RIGHTS AND SERVICES BASED ON THE COMPANY\u0092S ESPS. REVENUE ALLOCATED TO THE\nUNSPECIFIED SOFTWARE UPGRADE RIGHTS AND NON-SOFTWARE SERVICES BASED ON THE COMPANY\u0092S ESPS IS DEFERRED AND RECOGNIZED ON A STRAIGHT-LINE BASIS OVER THE ESTIMATED PERIOD THE SOFTWARE UPGRADES AND NON-SOFTWARE SERVICES ARE EXPECTED TO BE PROVIDED\nFOR EACH OF THESE DEVICES, WHICH RANGES FROM TWO TO FOUR YEARS.\nTHE COMPANY\u0092S PROCESS FOR DETERMINING ESPS INVOLVES\nMANAGEMENT\u0092S JUDGMENT AND CONSIDERS MULTIPLE FACTORS THAT MAY VARY OVER TIME DEPENDING UPON THE UNIQUE FACTS AND CIRCUMSTANCES RELATED TO EACH DELIVERABLE. SHOULD FUTURE FACTS AND CIRCUMSTANCES CHANGE, THE COMPANY\u0092S ESPS AND THE FUTURE\nRATE OF RELATED AMORTIZATION FOR SOFTWARE UPGRADES AND NON-SOFTWARE SERVICES RELATED TO FUTURE SALES OF THESE DEVICES COULD CHANGE. FACTORS SUBJECT TO CHANGE INCLUDE THE UNSPECIFIED SOFTWARE UPGRADE RIGHTS OFFERED, THE ESTIMATED VALUE OF UNSPECIFIED\nSOFTWARE UPGRADE RIGHTS, THE ESTIMATED OR ACTUAL COSTS INCURRED TO PROVIDE NON-SOFTWARE SERVICES, AND THE ESTIMATED PERIOD SOFTWARE UPGRADES AND NON-SOFTWARE SERVICES ARE EXPECTED TO BE PROVIDED.\nTHE COMPANY RECORDS REDUCTIONS TO REVENUE FOR ESTIMATED COMMITMENTS RELATED TO PRICE PROTECTION AND OTHER CUSTOMER INCENTIVE PROGRAMS.\nFOR TRANSACTIONS INVOLVING PRICE PROTECTION, THE COMPANY RECOGNIZES REVENUE NET OF THE ESTIMATED AMOUNT TO BE REFUNDED, PROVIDED THE REFUND AMOUNT CAN BE REASONABLY AND RELIABLY ESTIMATED AND THE OTHER CONDITIONS FOR REVENUE RECOGNITION HAVE BEEN\nMET. THE COMPANY\u0092S POLICY REQUIRES THAT, IF REFUNDS CANNOT BE RELIABLY ESTIMATED, REVENUE IS NOT RECOGNIZED UNTIL RELIABLE ESTIMATES CAN BE MADE OR THE PRICE PROTECTION LAPSES. FOR THE COMPANY\u0092S OTHER CUSTOMER INCENTIVE PROGRAMS, THE\nESTIMATED COST IS RECOGNIZED AT THE LATER OF THE DATE AT WHICH THE COMPANY HAS SOLD THE PRODUCT OR THE DATE AT WHICH THE PROGRAM IS OFFERED. THE COMPANY ALSO RECORDS REDUCTIONS TO REVENUE FOR EXPECTED FUTURE PRODUCT RETURNS BASED ON THE\nCOMPANY\u0092S HISTORICAL EXPERIENCE. FUTURE MARKET CONDITIONS AND PRODUCT TRANSITIONS MAY REQUIRE THE COMPANY TO INCREASE CUSTOMER INCENTIVE PROGRAMS THAT COULD RESULT IN REDUCTIONS TO FUTURE REVENUE. ADDITIONALLY, CERTAIN CUSTOMER INCENTIVE\nPROGRAMS REQUIRE MANAGEMENT TO ESTIMATE THE NUMBER OF CUSTOMERS WHO WILL ACTUALLY REDEEM THE INCENTIVE. MANAGEMENT\u0092S ESTIMATES ARE BASED ON HISTORICAL EXPERIENCE AND THE SPECIFIC TERMS AND CONDITIONS OF PARTICULAR INCENTIVE PROGRAMS. IF A\nGREATER THAN ESTIMATED PROPORTION OF CUSTOMERS REDEEMS SUCH INCENTIVES, THE COMPANY WOULD BE REQUIRED TO RECORD ADDITIONAL REDUCTIONS TO REVENUE, WHICH WOULD HAVE AN ADVERSE IMPACT ON THE COMPANY\u0092S RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.\nVALUATION AND IMPAIRMENT OF MARKETABLE SECURITIES\nTHE COMPANY\u0092S INVESTMENTS IN AVAILABLE-FOR-SALE SECURITIES ARE REPORTED AT FAIR VALUE. UNREALIZED GAINS AND LOSSES RELATED TO CHANGES IN THE FAIR VALUE OF SECURITIES ARE RECOGNIZED IN ACCUMULATED\nOTHER COMPREHENSIVE INCOME, NET OF TAX, IN THE COMPANY\u0092S CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS. CHANGES IN THE FAIR VALUE OF AVAILABLE-FOR-SALE SECURITIES\n39\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nIMPACT THE COMPANY\u0092S NET INCOME ONLY WHEN SUCH SECURITIES ARE SOLD OR AN OTHER-THAN-TEMPORARY IMPAIRMENT IS RECOGNIZED. REALIZED GAINS AND LOSSES ON THE SALE OF SECURITIES ARE DETERMINED BY\nSPECIFIC IDENTIFICATION OF EACH SECURITY\u0092S COST BASIS. THE COMPANY REGULARLY REVIEWS ITS INVESTMENT PORTFOLIO TO DETERMINE IF ANY SECURITY IS OTHER-THAN-TEMPORARILY IMPAIRED, WHICH WOULD REQUIRE THE COMPANY TO RECORD AN IMPAIRMENT CHARGE IN THE\nPERIOD ANY SUCH DETERMINATION IS MADE. IN MAKING THIS JUDGMENT, THE COMPANY EVALUATES, AMONG OTHER THINGS, THE DURATION AND EXTENT TO WHICH THE FAIR VALUE OF A SECURITY IS LESS THAN ITS COST; THE FINANCIAL CONDITION OF THE ISSUER AND ANY CHANGES\nTHERETO; AND THE COMPANY\u0092S INTENT TO SELL, OR WHETHER IT WILL MORE LIKELY THAN NOT BE REQUIRED TO SELL, THE SECURITY BEFORE RECOVERY OF ITS AMORTIZED COST BASIS. THE COMPANY\u0092S ASSESSMENT ON WHETHER A SECURITY IS OTHER-THAN-TEMPORARILY\nIMPAIRED COULD CHANGE IN THE FUTURE DUE TO NEW DEVELOPMENTS OR CHANGES IN ASSUMPTIONS RELATED TO ANY PARTICULAR SECURITY.\nINVENTORY VALUATION AND VALUATION OF MANUFACTURING-RELATED ASSETS AND ESTIMATED PURCHASE COMMITMENT CANCELLATION FEES\nTHE COMPANY MUST ORDER COMPONENTS FOR ITS PRODUCTS AND BUILD INVENTORY IN ADVANCE OF PRODUCT SHIPMENTS AND HAS INVESTED IN MANUFACTURING\nPROCESS EQUIPMENT, INCLUDING CAPITAL ASSETS HELD AT ITS SUPPLIERS\u0092 FACILITIES. IN ADDITION, THE COMPANY HAS MADE PREPAYMENTS TO CERTAIN OF ITS SUPPLIERS ASSOCIATED WITH LONG-TERM SUPPLY AGREEMENTS TO SECURE SUPPLY OF INVENTORY COMPONENTS. THE\nCOMPANY RECORDS A WRITE-DOWN FOR INVENTORIES OF COMPONENTS AND PRODUCTS, INCLUDING THIRD-PARTY PRODUCTS HELD FOR RESALE, WHICH HAVE BECOME OBSOLETE OR ARE IN EXCESS OF ANTICIPATED DEMAND OR NET REALIZABLE VALUE. THE COMPANY PERFORMS A DETAILED\nREVIEW OF INVENTORY THAT CONSIDERS MULTIPLE FACTORS INCLUDING DEMAND FORECASTS, PRODUCT LIFE CYCLE STATUS, PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT PLANS, CURRENT SALES LEVELS, AND COMPONENT COST TRENDS. THE COMPANY ALSO REVIEWS ITS MANUFACTURING-RELATED CAPITAL ASSETS\nAND INVENTORY PREPAYMENTS FOR IMPAIRMENT WHENEVER EVENTS OR CIRCUMSTANCES INDICATE THE CARRYING AMOUNT OF SUCH ASSETS MAY NOT BE RECOVERABLE. IF THE COMPANY DETERMINES THAT AN ASSET IS NOT RECOVERABLE, IT RECORDS AN IMPAIRMENT LOSS EQUAL TO THE\nAMOUNT BY WHICH THE CARRYING VALUE OF SUCH AN ASSET EXCEEDS ITS FAIR VALUE.\nTHE INDUSTRIES IN WHICH THE COMPANY COMPETES ARE\nSUBJECT TO A RAPID AND UNPREDICTABLE PACE OF PRODUCT AND COMPONENT OBSOLESCENCE AND DEMAND CHANGES. IN CERTAIN CIRCUMSTANCES THE COMPANY MAY BE REQUIRED TO RECORD ADDITIONAL WRITE-DOWNS OF INVENTORY, INVENTORY PREPAYMENTS AND\/OR\nMANUFACTURING-RELATED CAPITAL ASSETS. THESE CIRCUMSTANCES INCLUDE FUTURE DEMAND OR MARKET CONDITIONS FOR THE COMPANY\u0092S PRODUCTS BEING LESS FAVORABLE THAN FORECASTED, UNFORESEEN TECHNOLOGICAL CHANGES OR CHANGES TO THE COMPANY\u0092S PRODUCT\nDEVELOPMENT PLANS THAT NEGATIVELY IMPACT THE UTILITY OF ANY OF THESE ASSETS, OR SIGNIFICANT DETERIORATION IN THE FINANCIAL CONDITION OF ONE OR MORE OF THE COMPANY\u0092S SUPPLIERS THAT HOLD ANY OF THE COMPANY\u0092S MANUFACTURING PROCESS EQUIPMENT\nOR TO WHOM THE COMPANY HAS MADE AN INVENTORY PREPAYMENT. SUCH WRITE-DOWNS WOULD ADVERSELY AFFECT THE COMPANY\u0092S RESULTS OF OPERATIONS IN THE PERIOD WHEN THE WRITE-DOWNS WERE RECORDED.\nTHE COMPANY RECORDS ACCRUALS FOR ESTIMATED CANCELLATION FEES RELATED TO COMPONENT ORDERS THAT HAVE BEEN CANCELLED OR ARE EXPECTED TO BE\nCANCELLED. CONSISTENT WITH INDUSTRY PRACTICE, THE COMPANY ACQUIRES COMPONENTS THROUGH A COMBINATION OF PURCHASE ORDERS, SUPPLIER CONTRACTS, AND OPEN ORDERS IN EACH CASE BASED ON PROJECTED DEMAND. WHERE APPROPRIATE, THE PURCHASES ARE\nAPPLIED TO INVENTORY COMPONENT PREPAYMENTS THAT ARE OUTSTANDING WITH THE RESPECTIVE SUPPLIER. PURCHASE COMMITMENTS TYPICALLY COVER THE COMPANY\u0092S FORECASTED COMPONENT AND MANUFACTURING REQUIREMENTS FOR PERIODS UP TO 150 DAYS.\nIF THERE IS AN ABRUPT AND SUBSTANTIAL DECLINE IN DEMAND FOR ONE OR MORE OF THE COMPANY\u0092S PRODUCTS, IF THE COMPANY\u0092S PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT PLANS CHANGE, OR IF THERE IS AN UNANTICIPATED CHANGE IN TECHNOLOGICAL REQUIREMENTS FOR ANY OF THE\nCOMPANY\u0092S PRODUCTS, THEN THE COMPANY MAY BE REQUIRED TO RECORD ADDITIONAL ACCRUALS FOR CANCELLATION FEES THAT WOULD ADVERSELY AFFECT ITS RESULTS OF OPERATIONS IN THE PERIOD WHEN THE CANCELLATION FEES ARE IDENTIFIED AND RECORDED.\nWARRANTY COSTS\nTHE COMPANY PROVIDES FOR THE ESTIMATED COST OF WARRANTIES AT THE TIME THE RELATED REVENUE IS RECOGNIZED BASED ON HISTORICAL AND PROJECTED WARRANTY CLAIM RATES, HISTORICAL AND PROJECTED COST-PER-CLAIM, AND\nKNOWLEDGE OF SPECIFIC PRODUCT FAILURES THAT ARE OUTSIDE OF THE COMPANY\u0092S TYPICAL EXPERIENCE. EACH QUARTER, THE COMPANY REEVALUATES\n40\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nTHESE ESTIMATES TO ASSESS THE ADEQUACY OF ITS RECORDED WARRANTY LIABILITIES CONSIDERING THE SIZE OF THE INSTALLED BASE OF PRODUCTS SUBJECT TO WARRANTY PROTECTION AND ADJUSTS THE AMOUNTS AS\nNECESSARY. IF ACTUAL PRODUCT FAILURE RATES OR REPAIR COSTS DIFFER FROM ESTIMATES, REVISIONS TO THE ESTIMATED WARRANTY LIABILITIES WOULD BE REQUIRED AND COULD MATERIALLY AFFECT THE COMPANY\u0092S RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.\nINCOME TAXES\nTHE COMPANY RECORDS A TAX PROVISION FOR THE ANTICIPATED TAX CONSEQUENCES OF THE REPORTED RESULTS OF OPERATIONS. THE PROVISION FOR INCOME TAXES IS COMPUTED USING THE ASSET AND LIABILITY METHOD, UNDER WHICH\nDEFERRED TAX ASSETS AND LIABILITIES ARE RECOGNIZED FOR THE EXPECTED FUTURE TAX CONSEQUENCES OF TEMPORARY DIFFERENCES BETWEEN THE FINANCIAL REPORTING AND TAX BASES OF ASSETS AND LIABILITIES, AND FOR OPERATING LOSSES AND TAX CREDIT CARRYFORWARDS.\nDEFERRED TAX ASSETS AND LIABILITIES ARE MEASURED USING THE CURRENTLY ENACTED TAX RATES THAT APPLY TO TAXABLE INCOME IN EFFECT FOR THE YEARS IN WHICH THOSE TAX ASSETS ARE EXPECTED TO BE REALIZED OR SETTLED. THE COMPANY RECORDS A VALUATION ALLOWANCE\nTO REDUCE DEFERRED TAX ASSETS TO THE AMOUNT THAT IS BELIEVED MORE LIKELY THAN NOT TO BE REALIZED.\nTHE COMPANY RECOGNIZES TAX\nBENEFITS FROM UNCERTAIN TAX POSITIONS ONLY IF IT IS MORE LIKELY THAN NOT THAT THE TAX POSITION WILL BE SUSTAINED ON EXAMINATION BY THE TAXING AUTHORITIES, BASED ON THE TECHNICAL MERITS OF THE POSITION. THE TAX BENEFITS RECOGNIZED IN THE FINANCIAL\nSTATEMENTS FROM SUCH POSITIONS ARE THEN MEASURED BASED ON THE LARGEST BENEFIT THAT HAS A GREATER THAN 50% LIKELIHOOD OF BEING REALIZED UPON ULTIMATE SETTLEMENT.\nMANAGEMENT BELIEVES IT IS MORE LIKELY THAN NOT THAT FORECASTED INCOME, INCLUDING INCOME THAT MAY BE GENERATED AS A RESULT OF CERTAIN TAX PLANNING STRATEGIES, TOGETHER WITH FUTURE REVERSALS OF EXISTING\nTAXABLE TEMPORARY DIFFERENCES, WILL BE SUFFICIENT TO FULLY RECOVER THE DEFERRED TAX ASSETS. IN THE EVENT THAT THE COMPANY DETERMINES ALL OR PART OF THE NET DEFERRED TAX ASSETS ARE NOT REALIZABLE IN THE FUTURE, THE COMPANY WILL MAKE AN ADJUSTMENT TO\nTHE VALUATION ALLOWANCE THAT WOULD BE CHARGED TO EARNINGS IN THE PERIOD SUCH DETERMINATION IS MADE. IN ADDITION, THE CALCULATION OF TAX LIABILITIES INVOLVES SIGNIFICANT JUDGMENT IN ESTIMATING THE IMPACT OF UNCERTAINTIES IN THE APPLICATION OF GAAP\nAND COMPLEX TAX LAWS. RESOLUTION OF THESE UNCERTAINTIES IN A MANNER INCONSISTENT WITH MANAGEMENT\u0092S EXPECTATIONS COULD HAVE A MATERIAL IMPACT ON THE COMPANY\u0092S FINANCIAL CONDITION AND OPERATING RESULTS.\nLEGAL AND OTHER CONTINGENCIES\nAS DISCUSSED IN PART I, ITEM 3 OF THIS FORM 10-K UNDER THE HEADING \u0093LEGAL PROCEEDINGS\u0094 AND IN PART II, ITEM 8 OF THIS FORM 10-K IN THE NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS IN\nNOTE 10, \u0093COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES,\u0094 THE COMPANY IS SUBJECT TO VARIOUS LEGAL PROCEEDINGS AND CLAIMS THAT ARISE IN THE ORDINARY COURSE OF BUSINESS. THE COMPANY RECORDS A LIABILITY WHEN IT IS PROBABLE THAT A LOSS HAS BEEN INCURRED AND\nTHE AMOUNT IS REASONABLY ESTIMABLE. THERE IS SIGNIFICANT JUDGMENT REQUIRED IN BOTH THE PROBABILITY DETERMINATION AND AS TO WHETHER AN EXPOSURE CAN BE REASONABLY ESTIMATED. IN THE OPINION OF MANAGEMENT, THERE WAS NOT AT LEAST A REASONABLE POSSIBILITY\nTHE COMPANY MAY HAVE INCURRED A MATERIAL LOSS, OR A MATERIAL LOSS IN EXCESS OF A RECORDED ACCRUAL, WITH RESPECT TO LOSS CONTINGENCIES FOR LEGAL AND OTHER CONTINGENCIES. HOWEVER, THE OUTCOME OF LEGAL PROCEEDINGS AND CLAIMS BROUGHT AGAINST THE COMPANY\nIS SUBJECT TO SIGNIFICANT UNCERTAINTY. THEREFORE, ALTHOUGH MANAGEMENT CONSIDERS THE LIKELIHOOD OF SUCH AN OUTCOME TO BE REMOTE, IF ONE OR MORE OF THESE LEGAL MATTERS WERE RESOLVED AGAINST THE COMPANY IN A REPORTING PERIOD FOR AMOUNTS IN EXCESS OF\nMANAGEMENT\u0092S EXPECTATIONS, THE COMPANY\u0092S CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR THAT REPORTING PERIOD COULD BE MATERIALLY ADVERSELY AFFECTED.\n41\nTABLE OF CONTENTS","27681":"ITEM 7.\nMANAGEMENT\u2019S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nTHE FOLLOWING DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF OUR FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS SHOULD BE READ TOGETHER WITH OUR CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND RELATED NOTES INCLUDED UNDER ITEM 8 OF THIS ANNUAL REPORT ON FORM 10-K.\nOVERVIEW\nGOOGLE IS A GLOBAL TECHNOLOGY LEADER FOCUSED ON IMPROVING THE WAYS PEOPLE CONNECT WITH INFORMATION. WE ASPIRE TO BUILD PRODUCTS AND PROVIDE SERVICES THAT IMPROVE THE LIVES OF BILLIONS OF PEOPLE GLOBALLY. OUR MISSION IS TO ORGANIZE THE WORLD\u2019S INFORMATION AND MAKE IT UNIVERSALLY ACCESSIBLE AND USEFUL. OUR INNOVATIONS IN WEB SEARCH AND ADVERTISING HAVE MADE OUR WEBSITE A TOP INTERNET PROPERTY AND OUR BRAND ONE OF THE MOST RECOGNIZED IN THE WORLD.  OUR GOOGLE SEGMENT GENERATES REVENUES PRIMARILY BY DELIVERING RELEVANT, COST-EFFECTIVE ONLINE ADVERTISING. BUSINESSES USE OUR ADWORDS PROGRAM AND ADSENSE PROGRAM TO PROMOTE THEIR PRODUCTS AND SERVICES WITH ADVERTISING ON BOTH GOOGLE-OWNED PROPERTIES AND PUBLISHERS' SITES ACROSS THE WEB.\nOUR MOTOROLA MOBILE SEGMENT IS FOCUSED ON MOBILE WIRELESS DEVICES AND RELATED PRODUCTS AND SERVICES AND GENERATES REVENUES PRIMARILY BY SELLING HARDWARE PRODUCTS. IN JANUARY 2014, WE ENTERED INTO AN AGREEMENT WITH LENOVO PROVIDING FOR THE DISPOSITION OF THE MOTOROLA MOBILE SEGMENT. THE TRANSACTION IS EXPECTED TO CLOSE IN 2014.\nTHE MOTOROLA HOME SEGMENT WAS FOCUSED ON TECHNOLOGIES AND DEVICES THAT PROVIDE VIDEO ENTERTAINMENT SERVICES TO CONSUMERS BY ENABLING SUBSCRIBERS TO ACCESS A VARIETY OF INTERACTIVE DIGITAL TELEVISION SERVICES. IN DECEMBER 2012, WE ENTERED INTO AN AGREEMENT FOR THE DISPOSITION OF THE MOTOROLA HOME SEGMENT. THE TRANSACTION CLOSED ON APRIL 17, 2013. ALL FINANCIAL RESULTS RELATED TO MOTOROLA HOME WERE PRESENTED AS NET INCOME (LOSS) FROM DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS ON THE CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF INCOME.\nTRENDS IN OUR BUSINESSES\nADVERTISING TRANSACTIONS CONTINUE TO SHIFT FROM OFFLINE TO ONLINE AS THE DIGITAL ECONOMY EVOLVES. THIS HAS CONTRIBUTED TO THE RAPID GROWTH OF OUR BUSINESS SINCE INCEPTION, RESULTING IN SUBSTANTIALLY INCREASED REVENUES, AND WE EXPECT THAT OUR BUSINESS WILL CONTINUE TO GROW. HOWEVER, OUR REVENUE GROWTH RATE HAS GENERALLY DECLINED OVER TIME, AND IT COULD DO SO IN THE FUTURE AS A RESULT OF A NUMBER OF FACTORS, INCLUDING INCREASING COMPETITION, OUR INVESTMENTS IN NEW BUSINESS STRATEGIES, PRODUCTS, SERVICES, AND TECHNOLOGIES, CHANGES IN OUR PRODUCT MIX, SHIFTS IN THE GEOGRAPHIC MIX OF OUR REVENUES, QUERY GROWTH RATES AND HOW USERS MAKE QUERIES, CHALLENGES IN MAINTAINING OUR GROWTH RATE AS OUR REVENUES INCREASE TO HIGHER LEVELS, AND THE EVOLUTION OF THE ONLINE ADVERTISING MARKET, INCLUDING THE INCREASING VARIETY OF ONLINE PLATFORMS FOR ADVERTISING, AND OTHER MARKETS IN WHICH WE PARTICIPATE.\nOUR USERS ARE INCREASINGLY CONNECTED TO THE INTERNET AND USING MULTIPLE DEVICES TO ACCESS OUR PRODUCTS AND SERVICES, A TREND THAT HAS INCREASED OUR GLOBAL SEARCH QUERIES AND CHANGED OUR PLATFORM MIX. WE EXPECT THAT OUR REVENUE GROWTH RATE WILL CONTINUE TO BE AFFECTED BY EVOLVING CONSUMER PREFERENCES, AS WELL AS BY ADVERTISING TRENDS, THE ACCEPTANCE BY USERS OF OUR PRODUCTS AND SERVICES AS THEY ARE DELIVERED ON DIVERSE DEVICES, AND OUR ABILITY TO CREATE A SEAMLESS EXPERIENCE FOR BOTH USERS AND ADVERTISERS IN THIS MULTI-SCREEN ENVIRONMENT.\nTHE MAIN FOCUS OF OUR ADVERTISING PROGRAMS IS TO HELP BUSINESSES REACH PEOPLE IN THE MOMENTS THAT MATTER ACROSS ALL DEVICES WITH SMARTER ADS THAT ARE RELEVANT TO THEIR INTENT AND CONTEXT, REFLECTING OUR COMMITMENT TO CONSTANTLY IMPROVE THEIR OVERALL WEB EXPERIENCE. AS A RESULT, WE EXPECT TO CONTINUE TO TAKE STEPS TO IMPROVE THE RELEVANCE OF THE ADS DISPLAYED ON OUR WEBSITES AND OUR GOOGLE NETWORK MEMBERS\u2019 WEBSITES. THESE STEPS INCLUDE NOT DISPLAYING ADS THAT GENERATE LOW CLICK-THROUGH RATES OR THAT SEND USERS TO IRRELEVANT OR OTHERWISE LOW-QUALITY WEBSITES, UPDATING OUR ADVERTISING POLICIES AND ENSURING THEIR COMPLIANCE, AND TERMINATING OUR RELATIONSHIPS WITH THOSE GOOGLE NETWORK MEMBERS WHOSE WEBSITES DO NOT MEET OUR QUALITY REQUIREMENTS. WE MAY ALSO CONTINUE TO TAKE STEPS TO REDUCE THE NUMBER OF ACCIDENTAL CLICKS BY OUR USERS. THESE STEPS COULD NEGATIVELY AFFECT THE GROWTH RATE OF OUR REVENUES.\nBOTH SEASONAL FLUCTUATIONS IN INTERNET USAGE AND TRADITIONAL RETAIL SEASONALITY HAVE AFFECTED, AND ARE LIKELY TO CONTINUE TO AFFECT, OUR BUSINESS. INTERNET USAGE GENERALLY SLOWS DURING THE SUMMER MONTHS, AND COMMERCIAL QUERIES TYPICALLY INCREASE SIGNIFICANTLY IN THE FOURTH QUARTER OF EACH YEAR. THESE SEASONAL TRENDS HAVE CAUSED, AND WILL LIKELY CONTINUE TO CAUSE, FLUCTUATIONS IN OUR QUARTERLY RESULTS, INCLUDING FLUCTUATIONS IN SEQUENTIAL REVENUES, AS WELL AS AGGREGATE PAID CLICKS AND AVERAGE COST-PER-CLICK GROWTH RATES.\nTHE OPERATING MARGIN WE REALIZE ON REVENUES GENERATED FROM ADS PLACED ON OUR GOOGLE NETWORK MEMBERS\u2019 WEBSITES THROUGH OUR ADSENSE PROGRAM IS SIGNIFICANTLY LOWER THAN THE OPERATING MARGIN WE REALIZE FROM REVENUES GENERATED FROM ADS PLACED ON OUR WEBSITES BECAUSE MOST OF THE ADVERTISER FEES FROM ADS SERVED ON GOOGLE NETWORK MEMBERS\u2019 WEBSITES ARE SHARED WITH OUR GOOGLE NETWORK MEMBERS. FOR THE PAST FIVE YEARS, GROWTH IN ADVERTISING\n25\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nREVENUES FROM OUR WEBSITES HAS GENERALLY EXCEEDED THAT FROM OUR GOOGLE NETWORK MEMBERS\u2019 WEBSITES. THIS TREND HAS HAD A POSITIVE IMPACT ON OUR OPERATING MARGINS, AND WE EXPECT THAT THIS WILL CONTINUE FOR THE FORESEEABLE FUTURE, ALTHOUGH THE RELATIVE RATE OF GROWTH IN REVENUES FROM OUR WEBSITES COMPARED TO THE RATE OF GROWTH IN REVENUES FROM OUR GOOGLE NETWORK MEMBERS\u2019 WEBSITES MAY VARY OVER TIME. ALSO, THE MARGINS ON ADVERTISING REVENUES FROM MOBILE PHONES AND OTHER NEWER ADVERTISING FORMATS ARE GENERALLY LOWER THAN THOSE FROM DESKTOP COMPUTERS AND TABLETS. WE EXPECT THIS TREND TO CONTINUE TO PRESSURE OUR MARGINS, PARTICULARLY IF WE FAIL TO REALIZE THE OPPORTUNITIES WE ANTICIPATE WITH THE TRANSITION TO A DYNAMIC MULTI-SCREEN ENVIRONMENT.\nWE CONDUCT OUR MOTOROLA MOBILE BUSINESS IN HIGHLY COMPETITIVE MARKETS, FACING BOTH NEW AND ESTABLISHED COMPETITORS. THE MARKETS FOR MANY OF OUR PRODUCTS ARE CHARACTERIZED BY RAPIDLY CHANGING TECHNOLOGIES, FREQUENT NEW PRODUCT INTRODUCTIONS, CHANGING CONSUMER TRENDS, SHORT PRODUCT LIFE CYCLES, CONSUMER LOYALTY AND EVOLVING INDUSTRY STANDARDS. MARKET DISRUPTIONS CAUSED BY NEW TECHNOLOGIES, THE ENTRY OF NEW COMPETITORS, CONSOLIDATIONS AMONG OUR CUSTOMERS AND COMPETITORS, CHANGES IN REGULATORY REQUIREMENTS, CHANGES IN ECONOMIC CONDITIONS, SUPPLY CHAIN INTERRUPTIONS OR OTHER FACTORS, CAN INTRODUCE VOLATILITY INTO OUR BUSINESSES. MEETING ALL OF THESE CHALLENGES REQUIRES CONSISTENT OPERATIONAL PLANNING AND EXECUTION AND INVESTMENT IN TECHNOLOGY, RESULTING IN INNOVATIVE PRODUCTS THAT MEET THE NEEDS OF OUR CUSTOMERS AROUND THE WORLD.\nFROM AN OVERALL BUSINESS PERSPECTIVE, WE CONTINUE TO INVEST AGGRESSIVELY IN AREAS OF STRATEGIC FOCUS, OUR SYSTEMS, DATA CENTERS, CORPORATE FACILITIES, INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY INFRASTRUCTURE, AND EMPLOYEES. WE EXPECT TO CONTINUE TO HIRE AGGRESSIVELY FOR 2014 AND PROVIDE COMPETITIVE COMPENSATION PROGRAMS TO OUR EMPLOYEES. OUR FULL-TIME EMPLOYEE HEADCOUNT WAS 53,861 (INCLUDING 11,113 HEADCOUNT FROM MOTOROLA MOBILE AND 5,204 FROM MOTOROLA HOME) AT DECEMBER 31, 2012, AND 47,756 (INCLUDING 3,894 HEADCOUNT FROM MOTOROLA MOBILE) AT DECEMBER 31, 2013. ACQUISITIONS WILL ALSO REMAIN AN IMPORTANT COMPONENT OF OUR STRATEGY AND USE OF CAPITAL. WE EXPECT OUR COST OF REVENUES WILL INCREASE IN DOLLARS AND MAY INCREASE AS A PERCENTAGE OF REVENUES IN FUTURE PERIODS, PRIMARILY AS A RESULT OF FORECASTED INCREASES IN TRAFFIC ACQUISITION COSTS, MANUFACTURING AND INVENTORY-RELATED COSTS, DATA CENTER COSTS, CONTENT ACQUISITION COSTS, CREDIT CARD AND OTHER TRANSACTION FEES, AND OTHER COSTS. IN PARTICULAR, TRAFFIC ACQUISITION COSTS AS A PERCENTAGE OF ADVERTISING REVENUES MAY INCREASE IN THE FUTURE IF WE ARE UNABLE TO CONTINUE TO IMPROVE THE MONETIZATION OR GENERATION OF REVENUES FROM TRAFFIC ON OUR WEBSITES AND OUR GOOGLE NETWORK MEMBERS\u2019 WEBSITES.\nAS WE EXPAND OUR ADVERTISING PROGRAMS AND OTHER PRODUCTS TO INTERNATIONAL MARKETS, WE CONTINUE TO INCREASE OUR EXPOSURE TO FLUCTUATIONS IN FOREIGN CURRENCY TO U.S. DOLLAR EXCHANGE RATES. WE HAVE A FOREIGN EXCHANGE RISK MANAGEMENT PROGRAM THAT IS DESIGNED TO REDUCE OUR EXPOSURE TO FLUCTUATIONS IN FOREIGN CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATES. HOWEVER, THIS PROGRAM WILL NOT FULLY OFFSET THE EFFECT OF FLUCTUATIONS ON OUR REVENUES AND EARNINGS.\nOTHER REVENUES CONSIST OF NON-ADVERTISING REVENUES INCLUDING LICENSING, HARDWARE AND DIGITAL CONTENT. WE EXPECT OTHER REVENUES TO CONTINUE TO GROW. HOWEVER, OPERATING MARGIN ON OTHER REVENUES IS GENERALLY LOWER THAN THAT ON ADVERTISING REVENUES.\nRESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nWE COMPLETED OUR ACQUISITION OF MOTOROLA ON MAY 22, 2012 (THE ACQUISITION DATE). IN DECEMBER 2012, WE ENTERED INTO AN AGREEMENT FOR THE DISPOSITION OF THE MOTOROLA HOME SEGMENT, AND CONSEQUENTLY, FINANCIAL RESULTS RELATED TO MOTOROLA HOME WERE PRESENTED AS NET INCOME (LOSS) FROM DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS IN THE CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF INCOME IN ALL PERIODS PRESENTED.  IN APRIL 2013, WE COMPLETED THE DISPOSITION OF THE MOTOROLA HOME SEGMENT.\nIN JANUARY 2014, WE ENTERED INTO AN AGREEMENT WITH LENOVO PROVIDING FOR THE DISPOSITION OF THE MOTOROLA MOBILE SEGMENT. THE TRANSACTION IS EXPECTED TO CLOSE IN 2014. AS WE EVALUATE THE IMPACT OF THIS AGREEMENT, WE EXPECT FINANCIAL RESULTS OF MOTOROLA MOBILE WILL BE PRESENTED AS NET INCOME (LOSS) FROM DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS ON THE CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF INCOME AND ASSETS AND LIABILITIES OF MOTOROLA MOBILE TO BE DISPOSED OF WILL BE PRESENTED AS HELD FOR SALE ON THE CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS BEGINNING IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2014.\nSUBSEQUENT TO THE ACQUISITION OF MOTOROLA, WE INITIATED A RESTRUCTURING PLAN OF OUR MOTOROLA BUSINESS. SEE NOTE 9 OF NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS INCLUDED IN ITEM 8 OF THIS ANNUAL REPORT ON FORM 10-K FOR FURTHER DISCUSSION OF THIS RESTRUCTURING PLAN AND THE ASSOCIATED RESTRUCTURING CHARGES.\nTHE FOLLOWING TABLE PRESENTS OUR HISTORICAL OPERATING RESULTS AS A PERCENTAGE OF REVENUES FOR THE PERIODS INDICATED.\n26\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nYEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31,\n2011\n2012\n2013\nCONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF INCOME DATA.\nREVENUES.\nGOOGLE (ADVERTISING AND OTHER)\n100.0%\n91.8%\n92.8%\nMOTOROLA MOBILE (HARDWARE AND OTHER)\n0.0\n8.2\n7.2\nTOTAL REVENUES\n100.0%\n100.0%\n100.0%\nCOSTS AND EXPENSES.\nCOST OF REVENUES - GOOGLE (ADVERTISING AND OTHER)\n34.8\n34.2\n36.8\nCOST OF REVENUES - MOTOROLA MOBILE (HARDWARE AND OTHER)\n0.0\n6.9\n6.5\nRESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT\n13.6\n13.5\n13.3\nSALES AND MARKETING\n12.1\n12.2\n12.1\nGENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE\n7.2\n7.8\n8.0\nCHARGE RELATED TO THE RESOLUTION OF DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE INVESTIGATION\n1.3\n0\n0\nTOTAL COSTS AND EXPENSES\n69.0%\n74.6%\n76.7%\nINCOME FROM OPERATIONS\n31.0\n25.4\n23.3\nINTEREST AND OTHER INCOME, NET\n1.5\n1.3\n0.9\nINCOME FROM CONTINUING OPERATIONS BEFORE INCOME TAXES\n32.5\n26.7\n24.2\nPROVISION FOR INCOME TAXES\n6.8\n5.2\n3.8\nNET INCOME FROM CONTINUING OPERATIONS\n25.7\n21.5\n20.4\nNET INCOME (LOSS) FROM DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS\n0.0\n(0.1\n)\n1.2\nNET INCOME\n25.7%\n21.4%\n21.6%\nREVENUES BY SEGMENT\nTHE FOLLOWING TABLE PRESENTS OUR SEGMENT REVENUES, BY REVENUE SOURCE, FOR THE PERIODS PRESENTED (IN MILLIONS).\nYEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31,\n2011\n2012\n2013\nADVERTISING REVENUES.\nGOOGLE WEBSITES\n$26,145\n$31,221\n$37,453\nGOOGLE NETWORK MEMBERS' WEBSITES\n10,386\n12,465\n13,125\nTOTAL ADVERTISING REVENUES\n36,531\n43,686\n50,578\nOTHER REVENUES\n1,374\n2,353\n4,972\nGOOGLE SEGMENT REVENUES\n$37,905\n$46,039\n$55,550\nMOTOROLA MOBILE SEGMENT REVENUES\n0\n4,136\n4,443\nELIMINATION AND OTHER\n0\n0\n(168\n)\nTOTAL REVENUES\n$37,905\n$50,175\n$59,825\nGOOGLE SEGMENT\nTHE FOLLOWING TABLE PRESENTS OUR GOOGLE SEGMENT REVENUES, BY REVENUE SOURCE, AS A PERCENTAGE OF TOTAL GOOGLE SEGMENT REVENUES FOR THE PERIODS PRESENTED.\n27\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nYEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31,\n2011\n2012\n2013\nADVERTISING REVENUES.\nGOOGLE WEBSITES\n69.0%\n67.8%\n67.4%\nGOOGLE NETWORK MEMBERS' WEBSITES\n27.4\n27.1\n23.6\nTOTAL ADVERTISING REVENUES\n96.4%\n94.9%\n91.0%\nOTHER REVENUES\n3.6\n5.1\n9.0\nTOTAL REVENUES\n100.0%\n100.0%\n100.0%\nGOOGLE WEBSITES AS % OF ADVERTISING REVENUES\n71.6%\n71.5%\n74.0%\nGOOGLE NETWORK MEMBERS\u2019 WEBSITES AS % OF ADVERTISING REVENUES\n28.4%\n28.5%\n26.0%\nOUR GOOGLE SEGMENT REVENUES INCREASED $9,511 MILLION FROM 2012 TO 2013. THIS INCREASE RESULTED PRIMARILY FROM AN INCREASE IN ADVERTISING REVENUES GENERATED BY GOOGLE WEBSITES AND AN INCREASE IN OTHER REVENUES, AND TO A LESSER EXTENT, AN INCREASE IN ADVERTISING REVENUES GENERATED BY GOOGLE NETWORK MEMBERS' WEBSITES. THE INCREASE IN OTHER REVENUES WAS MAINLY DRIVEN BY HIGHER SALES RELATED TO DIGITAL CONTENT AND HARDWARE PRODUCTS. THE INCREASE IN ADVERTISING REVENUES FOR GOOGLE WEBSITES AND GOOGLE NETWORK MEMBERS' WEBSITES RESULTED PRIMARILY FROM AN INCREASE IN THE NUMBER OF PAID CLICKS THROUGH OUR ADVERTISING PROGRAMS, AS PAID CLICKS ON GOOGLE WEBSITES AND GOOGLE NETWORK MEMBERS' WEBSITES INCREASED APPROXIMATELY 25% FROM 2012 TO 2013. THE INCREASE IN THE NUMBER OF PAID CLICKS GENERATED THROUGH OUR ADVERTISING PROGRAMS WAS DUE TO CERTAIN MONETIZATION IMPROVEMENTS INCLUDING NEW AND RICHER AD FORMATS, AN INCREASE IN AGGREGATE TRAFFIC ACROSS ALL PLATFORMS, THE CONTINUED GLOBAL EXPANSION OF OUR PRODUCTS, ADVERTISERS, AND USER BASE, AS WELL AS AN INCREASE IN THE NUMBER OF GOOGLE NETWORK MEMBERS, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY CERTAIN ADVERTISING POLICY CHANGES. THE IMPACT FROM THE INCREASE IN PAID CLICKS ON OUR REVENUE GROWTH WAS PARTIALLY OFFSET BY A DECREASE IN THE AVERAGE COST-PER-CLICK PAID BY OUR ADVERTISERS. AVERAGE COST-PER-CLICK ON GOOGLE WEBSITES AND GOOGLE NETWORK MEMBERS' WEBSITES DECREASED APPROXIMATELY 8% FROM 2012 TO 2013. THE DECREASE IN THE AVERAGE COST-PER-CLICK PAID BY OUR ADVERTISERS WAS DRIVEN BY VARIOUS FACTORS, SUCH AS THE INTRODUCTION OF NEW PRODUCTS AS WELL AS CHANGES IN PROPERTY MIX, PLATFORM MIX AND GEOGRAPHICAL MIX, AND THE GENERAL STRENGTHENING OF THE U.S. DOLLAR COMPARED TO CERTAIN FOREIGN CURRENCIES.\nOUR GOOGLE SEGMENT REVENUES INCREASED $8,134 MILLION FROM 2011 TO 2012. THIS INCREASE RESULTED PRIMARILY FROM AN INCREASE IN ADVERTISING REVENUES GENERATED BY GOOGLE WEBSITES AND GOOGLE NETWORK MEMBERS\u2019 WEBSITES AND, TO A LESSER EXTENT, AN INCREASE IN OTHER REVENUES DRIVEN BY HARDWARE PRODUCT SALES. THE INCREASE IN ADVERTISING REVENUES FOR GOOGLE WEBSITES AND GOOGLE NETWORK MEMBERS\u2019 WEBSITES RESULTED PRIMARILY FROM AN INCREASE IN THE NUMBER OF PAID CLICKS THROUGH OUR ADVERTISING PROGRAMS, AS AGGREGATE PAID CLICKS ON GOOGLE WEBSITES AND GOOGLE NETWORK MEMBERS\u2019 WEBSITES INCREASED APPROXIMATELY 34% FROM 2011 TO 2012. THE INCREASE IN THE NUMBER OF PAID CLICKS GENERATED THROUGH OUR ADVERTISING PROGRAMS WAS DUE TO AN INCREASE IN AGGREGATE TRAFFIC ACROSS ALL PLATFORMS, CERTAIN MONETIZATION IMPROVEMENTS INCLUDING NEW AD FORMATS, THE CONTINUED GLOBAL EXPANSION OF OUR PRODUCTS, ADVERTISERS, AND USER BASE, AS WELL AS AN INCREASE IN THE NUMBER OF GOOGLE NETWORK MEMBERS. THE IMPACT OF THIS INCREASE WAS PARTIALLY OFFSET BY A DECREASE IN THE AVERAGE COST-PER-CLICK PAID BY OUR ADVERTISERS. AVERAGE COST-PER-CLICK ON GOOGLE WEBSITES AND GOOGLE NETWORK MEMBERS\u2019 WEBSITES DECREASED APPROXIMATELY 12% FROM 2011 TO 2012. THE DECREASE IN THE AVERAGE COST-PER-CLICK PAID BY OUR ADVERTISERS WAS DRIVEN BY VARIOUS FACTORS, SUCH AS INTRODUCTION OF NEW PRODUCTS AS WELL AS CHANGES IN PROPERTY MIX, PLATFORM MIX AND GEOGRAPHICAL MIX, AND THE GENERAL STRENGTHENING OF THE U.S. DOLLAR COMPARED TO CERTAIN FOREIGN CURRENCIES.\nTHE RATE OF CHANGE IN AGGREGATE PAID CLICKS AND AVERAGE COST-PER-CLICK, AND THEIR CORRELATION WITH THE RATE OF CHANGE IN REVENUES, HAS FLUCTUATED AND MAY FLUCTUATE IN THE FUTURE BECAUSE OF VARIOUS FACTORS, INCLUDING THE REVENUE GROWTH RATES ON OUR WEBSITES COMPARED TO THOSE OF OUR GOOGLE NETWORK MEMBERS, ADVERTISER COMPETITION FOR KEYWORDS, CHANGES IN FOREIGN CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATES, SEASONALITY, THE FEES ADVERTISERS ARE WILLING TO PAY BASED ON HOW THEY MANAGE THEIR ADVERTISING COSTS, CHANGES IN ADVERTISING QUALITY OR FORMATS, AND GENERAL ECONOMIC CONDITIONS. IN ADDITION, TRAFFIC GROWTH IN EMERGING MARKETS COMPARED TO MORE MATURE MARKETS AND ACROSS VARIOUS ADVERTISING VERTICALS AND CHANNELS ALSO CONTRIBUTES TO THESE FLUCTUATIONS. CHANGES IN AGGREGATE PAID CLICKS AND AVERAGE COST-PER-CLICK MAY NOT BE INDICATIVE OF OUR PERFORMANCE OR ADVERTISER EXPERIENCES IN ANY SPECIFIC GEOGRAPHIC MARKET, VERTICAL, OR INDUSTRY.\nIMPROVEMENTS IN OUR ABILITY TO MONETIZE INCREASED TRAFFIC PRIMARILY RELATE TO ENHANCING THE END USER EXPERIENCE, INCLUDING PROVIDING END USERS WITH ADS THAT ARE MORE RELEVANT TO THEIR SEARCH QUERIES OR TO THE CONTENT ON THE GOOGLE NETWORK MEMBERS\u2019 WEBSITES THEY VISIT. FOR INSTANCE, THESE IMPROVEMENTS INCLUDE DISPLAYING ADVERTISER-NOMINATED IMAGES THAT ARE RELEVANT TO THE USER QUERY AND CREATING A MORE ENGAGING USER SHOPPING EXPERIENCE BY ENHANCING\n28\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nSEARCH ADS TO INCLUDE RICHER PRODUCT INFORMATION, SUCH AS PRODUCT IMAGE, PRICE, AND MERCHANT NAME. WE BELIEVE THAT THE INCREASE IN THE NUMBER OF PAID CLICKS ON GOOGLE WEBSITES AND GOOGLE NETWORK MEMBERS\u2019 WEBSITES IS SUBSTANTIALLY THE RESULT OF OUR COMMITMENT TO IMPROVING THE RELEVANCE AND QUALITY OF BOTH OUR SEARCH RESULTS AND THE ADVERTISEMENTS DISPLAYED, WHICH WE BELIEVE RESULTS IN A BETTER USER EXPERIENCE, WHICH IN TURN RESULTS IN MORE SEARCHES, ADVERTISERS, GOOGLE NETWORK MEMBERS AND OTHER PARTNERS.\nOTHER REVENUES IN OUR GOOGLE SEGMENT INCREASED $2,619 MILLION FROM 2012 TO 2013 AND ALSO INCREASED AS A PERCENTAGE OF THE SEGMENT REVENUES. THE INCREASE WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO GROWTH OF OUR DIGITAL CONTENT PRODUCTS, SUCH AS APPS, MUSIC AND MOVIES. ADDITIONALLY, WE EXPERIENCED AN INCREASE IN OUR HARDWARE REVENUES DUE TO CHROMECAST, DIRECTLY-SOLD NEXUS PRODUCTS AND CHROME OS DEVICES. IN 2011, OTHER REVENUE WAS NOT A SIGNIFICANT DRIVER OF OVERALL GOOGLE SEGMENT REVENUES.\nMOTOROLA MOBILE SEGMENT\nOUR MOTOROLA MOBILE SEGMENT REVENUES INCREASED $307 MILLION FROM 2012 TO 2013. THE INCREASE WAS DUE TO APPROXIMATELY SEVEN MONTHS OF RESULTS BEING INCLUDED IN 2012 WHILE TWELVE MONTHS OF RESULTS WERE INCLUDED IN 2013 AND A 14% INCREASE IN AVERAGE SELLING PRICE (\u201cASP\u201d) RELATED TO NEW PRODUCT LAUNCHES AND CHANGES IN PRODUCT MIX DURING THE YEAR, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY A 6% DECREASE IN UNITS SHIPPED DURING 2013. WE NOTE THAT RESULTS BETWEEN 2012 AND 2013 ARE NOT COMPARABLE DUE TO THE SIGNIFICANT RESTRUCTURING EFFORTS TO SIMPLIFY THE PRODUCT PORTFOLIO COMPLETED OVER THE NINETEEN-MONTH PERIOD.\nTHE INCREASE IN THE MOTOROLA MOBILE SEGMENT REVENUES FROM\n2011\nTO\n2012\nRESULTED FROM THE INCLUSION OF REVENUES FROM THE MOTOROLA MOBILE SEGMENT OF $4,136 MILLION SUBSEQUENT TO THE ACQUISITION IN MAY 2012.\nELIMINATION AND OTHER\nBEGINNING IN THE THIRD QUARTER OF 2013, GOOGLE AND MOTOROLA MOBILE SEGMENT REVENUES HAVE BEEN IMPACTED BY INTERSEGMENT TRANSACTIONS THAT ARE ELIMINATED IN CONSOLIDATION.

SUBSEQUENT TO THE TRANSACTION, WE OWN APPROXIMATELY 7.8% OF THE OUTSTANDING SHARES OF ARRIS. ADDITIONALLY, IN CONNECTION WITH THE DISPOSITION, WE AGREED TO INDEMNIFY ARRIS FOR POTENTIAL LIABILITY FROM CERTAIN INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY INFRINGEMENT LITIGATION, FOR WHICH WE RECORDED AN INDEMNIFICATION LIABILITY OF $175 MILLION, THE MAJORITY OF WHICH WAS SETTLED DURING 2013.\nTHE DISPOSITION RESULTED IN A NET GAIN OF $757 MILLION, WHICH WAS PRESENTED AS PART OF NET INCOME FROM DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS IN THE CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF INCOME FOR THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2013.\nTHE MOTOROLA HOME SEGMENT RESULTS HAVE BEEN PRESENTED AS A DISCONTINUED OPERATION FOR THE YEARS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2012 AND 2013.

CASH EQUIVALENTS AND MARKETABLE SECURITIES ARE COMPRISED OF TIME DEPOSITS, MONEY MARKET AND OTHER FUNDS, INCLUDING CASH COLLATERAL RECEIVED RELATED TO OUR SECURITIES LENDING PROGRAM, HIGHLY LIQUID DEBT INSTRUMENTS OF THE U.S. GOVERNMENT AND ITS AGENCIES, DEBT INSTRUMENTS ISSUED BY FOREIGN GOVERNMENTS, DEBT INSTRUMENTS ISSUED BY MUNICIPALITIES IN THE U.S., CORPORATE SECURITIES, MORTGAGE-BACKED SECURITIES AND ASSET-BACKED SECURITIES.\nAS OF\nDECEMBER 31, 2013\n, $33.6 BILLION OF THE\n$58.7 BILLION\nOF CASH, CASH EQUIVALENTS, AND MARKETABLE SECURITIES WAS HELD BY OUR FOREIGN SUBSIDIARIES. IF THESE FUNDS ARE NEEDED FOR OUR OPERATIONS IN THE U.S., WE WOULD BE REQUIRED TO ACCRUE AND PAY U.S. TAXES TO REPATRIATE THESE FUNDS. HOWEVER, OUR INTENT IS TO PERMANENTLY REINVEST THESE FUNDS OUTSIDE OF THE U.S. AND OUR CURRENT PLANS DO NOT DEMONSTRATE A NEED TO REPATRIATE THEM TO FUND OUR U.S. OPERATIONS.\nOUR PRINCIPAL SOURCES OF LIQUIDITY ARE OUR CASH, CASH EQUIVALENTS, AND MARKETABLE SECURITIES, AS WELL AS THE CASH FLOW THAT WE GENERATE FROM OUR OPERATIONS. AT\nDECEMBER 31, 2013\n, WE HAD UNUSED LETTERS OF CREDIT FOR APPROXIMATELY $173 MILLION. WE BELIEVE THAT OUR SOURCES OF FUNDING WILL BE SUFFICIENT TO SATISFY OUR CURRENTLY ANTICIPATED CASH REQUIREMENTS THROUGH AT LEAST THE NEXT 12 MONTHS. OUR LIQUIDITY COULD BE NEGATIVELY AFFECTED BY A DECREASE IN DEMAND FOR OUR PRODUCTS AND SERVICES. IN ADDITION, WE MAY MAKE ACQUISITIONS OR LICENSE PRODUCTS AND TECHNOLOGIES COMPLEMENTARY TO OUR BUSINESS AND MAY NEED TO RAISE ADDITIONAL CAPITAL THROUGH FUTURE DEBT OR EQUITY FINANCING TO PROVIDE FOR GREATER FLEXIBILITY TO FUND ANY SUCH ACQUISITIONS AND LICENSING ACTIVITIES. ADDITIONAL FINANCING MAY NOT BE AVAILABLE AT ALL OR ON TERMS FAVORABLE TO US.\n38\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nWE HAVE A DEBT FINANCING PROGRAM OF UP TO $3.0 BILLION THROUGH THE ISSUANCE OF COMMERCIAL PAPER. NET PROCEEDS FROM THIS PROGRAM ARE USED FOR GENERAL CORPORATE PURPOSES. AS OF\nDECEMBER 31, 2013\n, WE HAD $2.0 BILLION OF COMMERCIAL PAPER OUTSTANDING RECORDED AS SHORT-TERM DEBT, WITH A WEIGHTED-AVERAGE INTEREST RATE OF 0.1% THAT MATURE AT VARIOUS DATES THROUGH JUNE 2014. AVERAGE COMMERCIAL PAPER BORROWINGS DURING THE YEAR WERE $2.1 BILLION AND THE MAXIMUM AMOUNT OUTSTANDING DURING THE YEAR WAS $2.5 BILLION. IN CONJUNCTION WITH THIS PROGRAM, WE HAVE A $3.0 BILLION REVOLVING CREDIT FACILITY EXPIRING IN JULY 2016. THE INTEREST RATE FOR THE CREDIT FACILITY IS DETERMINED BASED ON A FORMULA USING CERTAIN MARKET RATES. AS OF\nDECEMBER 31, 2013\n, WE WERE IN COMPLIANCE WITH THE FINANCIAL COVENANT IN THE CREDIT FACILITY AND NO AMOUNTS WERE OUTSTANDING.\nIN MAY 2011, WE ISSUED $3.0 BILLION OF UNSECURED SENIOR NOTES IN THREE EQUAL TRANCHES, DUE IN 2014, 2016, AND 2021, WITH STATED INTEREST RATES OF 1.25%, 2.125%, AND 3.625%. THE NET PROCEEDS FROM THE SALE OF THE NOTES WERE USED TO REPAY A PORTION OF OUR OUTSTANDING COMMERCIAL PAPER AND FOR GENERAL CORPORATE PURPOSES. IN MAY 2013, WE RECLASSIFIED THE FIRST TRANCHE OF $1.0 BILLION UNSECURED SENIOR NOTES DUE IN MAY 2014 AS SHORT-TERM DEBT. WE PLAN TO ISSUE $1.0 BILLION OF LONG-TERM DEBT WHEN THIS NOTE MATURES IN 2014. AS OF\nDECEMBER 31, 2013\n, THE TOTAL CARRYING VALUE AND ESTIMATED FAIR VALUE OF THESE NOTES WERE $3.0 BILLION AND $3.1 BILLION. THE ESTIMATED FAIR VALUE WAS BASED ON QUOTED PRICES FOR OUR PUBLICLY-TRADED DEBT AS OF\nDECEMBER 31, 2013\n. WE ARE NOT SUBJECT TO ANY FINANCIAL COVENANTS UNDER THE NOTES.\nIN AUGUST 2013, WE ENTERED INTO A $258 MILLION CAPITAL LEASE OBLIGATION ON CERTAIN PROPERTY EXPIRING IN 2028 WITH AN OPTION TO PURCHASE IN 2016. THE EFFECTIVE RATE OF THE CAPITAL LEASE OBLIGATION APPROXIMATES THE MARKET RATE.  THE ESTIMATED FAIR VALUE OF THE CAPITAL LEASE OBLIGATION APPROXIMATED ITS CARRYING VALUE AT DECEMBER 31, 2013.\nIN SUMMARY, OUR CASH FLOWS ARE AS FOLLOWS (IN MILLIONS).\nYEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31,\n2011\n2012\n2013\nNET CASH PROVIDED BY OPERATING ACTIVITIES\n$14,565\n$16,619\n$18,659\nNET CASH USED IN INVESTING ACTIVITIES\n(19,041\n)\n(13,056\n)\n(13,679\n)\nNET CASH PROVIDED BY (USED IN) FINANCING ACTIVITIES\n807\n1,229\n(857\n)\nCASH PROVIDED BY OPERATING ACTIVITIES\nOUR LARGEST SOURCE OF CASH PROVIDED BY OPERATING CASH FLOWS IS ADVERTISING REVENUES GENERATED BY GOOGLE WEBSITES AND GOOGLE NETWORK MEMBERS' WEBSITES. WE ALSO GENERATE CASH FROM THE SALE OF OUR HARDWARE PRODUCTS, PRIMARILY IN THE MOTOROLA MOBILE SEGMENT. OUR PRIMARY USES OF CASH FROM OPERATING ACTIVITIES INCLUDE PAYMENTS TO OUR GOOGLE NETWORK MEMBERS AND DISTRIBUTION PARTNERS, WHICH ARE BASED ON THE REVENUE SHARE OR FIXED FEE ARRANGEMENTS, AS WELL AS PAYMENTS FOR MANUFACTURING AND INVENTORY-RELATED COSTS PRIMARILY FOR THE MOTOROLA MOBILE SEGMENT. IN ADDITION, USES OF CASH FROM OPERATING ACTIVITIES INCLUDE COMPENSATION AND RELATED COSTS, OTHER GENERAL CORPORATE EXPENDITURES AND INCOME TAXES.\nCASH PROVIDED BY OPERATING ACTIVITIES CONSIST OF NET INCOME ADJUSTED FOR CERTAIN NON-CASH ITEMS, INCLUDING STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION EXPENSE, DEPRECIATION, AMORTIZATION, DEFERRED INCOME TAXES, EXCESS TAX BENEFITS FROM STOCK-BASED AWARD ACTIVITIES, AS WELL AS THE EFFECT OF CHANGES IN WORKING CAPITAL AND OTHER ACTIVITIES.\nNET CASH PROVIDED BY OPERATING ACTIVITIES INCREASED FROM 2012 TO 2013, PRIMARILY DUE TO INCREASED NET INCOME ADJUSTED FOR GAIN ON DIVESTITURE OF BUSINESSES, DEPRECIATION AND AMORTIZATION EXPENSE ON PROPERTY AND EQUIPMENT, STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION EXPENSE, AND AMORTIZATION OF INTANGIBLE ASSETS. THESE INCREASES WERE PARTIALLY OFFSET BY THE NET DECREASE IN CASH FROM CHANGES IN WORKING CAPITAL PRIMARILY AS A RESULT OF A DECREASE IN INCOME TAXES, AN INCREASE IN ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE AND INVENTORIES, OFFSET BY AN INCREASE IN ACCOUNTS PAYABLE.\nNET CASH PROVIDED BY OPERATING ACTIVITIES INCREASED FROM 2011 TO 2012, PRIMARILY DUE TO INCREASED NET INCOME ADJUSTED FOR GAIN ON DIVESTITURE OF BUSINESSES, STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION EXPENSE, DEPRECIATION AND AMORTIZATION EXPENSE ON PROPERTY AND EQUIPMENT AND AMORTIZATION OF INTANGIBLE ASSETS. IN ADDITION, THERE WAS A NET INCREASE IN CASH FROM CHANGES IN WORKING CAPITAL PRIMARILY DRIVEN BY AN INCREASE IN INCOME TAXES AND A DECREASE IN ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE AND INVENTORIES.  THESE INCREASES WERE PARTIALLY OFFSET BY THE NET INCREASE IN PREPAID AND OTHER ASSETS AND A DECREASE IN ACCOUNTS PAYABLE.\n39\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nAS WE EXPAND OUR BUSINESS INTERNATIONALLY, WE HAVE OFFERED PAYMENT TERMS TO CERTAIN ADVERTISERS THAT ARE STANDARD IN THEIR LOCALES BUT LONGER THAN TERMS WE WOULD GENERALLY OFFER TO OUR DOMESTIC ADVERTISERS. THIS MAY INCREASE OUR WORKING CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS AND MAY HAVE A NEGATIVE EFFECT ON CASH PROVIDED BY OUR OPERATING ACTIVITIES.\nCASH USED IN INVESTING ACTIVITIES\nCASH PROVIDED BY OR USED IN INVESTING ACTIVITIES PRIMARILY CONSIST OF PURCHASES, MATURITIES, AND SALES OF MARKETABLE SECURITIES, ACQUISITIONS OF BUSINESSES AND INTANGIBLE ASSETS, DIVESTITURE OF BUSINESSES, AND PURCHASES OF PROPERTY AND EQUIPMENT. IN ADDITION, CASH PROVIDED BY OR USED IN INVESTING ACTIVITIES INCLUDE OUR INVESTMENTS IN REVERSE REPURCHASE AGREEMENTS AND THE CASH COLLATERAL RECEIVED OR RETURNED FROM OUR SECURITIES LENDING PROGRAM.\nCASH USED IN INVESTING ACTIVITIES INCREASED FROM 2012 TO 2013, PRIMARILY ATTRIBUTABLE TO A NET INCREASE IN PURCHASES OF MARKETABLE SECURITIES AND AN INCREASE IN CAPITAL EXPENDITURES PRIMARILY RELATED TO OUR PRODUCTION EQUIPMENT, DATA CENTERS, AND REAL ESTATE PURCHASES. THIS INCREASE WAS PARTIALLY OFFSET BY LOWER SPEND RELATED TO ACQUISITIONS AND AN INCREASE IN PROCEEDS RECEIVED FROM DIVESTITURE OF BUSINESSES.\nCASH USED IN INVESTING ACTIVITIES DECREASED FROM 2011 TO 2012, PRIMARILY ATTRIBUTABLE TO A DECREASE IN PURCHASES OF MARKETABLE SECURITIES, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY A DECREASE IN MATURITIES AND SALES OF MARKETABLE SECURITIES AND AN INCREASE IN SPEND RELATED TO ACQUISITIONS DUE TO THE PURCHASE OF MOTOROLA IN 2012.\nIN ORDER TO MANAGE EXPECTED INCREASES IN INTERNET TRAFFIC, ADVERTISING TRANSACTIONS, AND NEW PRODUCTS AND SERVICES, AND TO SUPPORT OUR OVERALL GLOBAL BUSINESS EXPANSION, WE EXPECT TO MAKE SIGNIFICANT INVESTMENTS IN PRODUCTION EQUIPMENT, OUR SYSTEMS, DATA CENTERS, CORPORATE FACILITIES, AND INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY INFRASTRUCTURE IN 2014 AND THEREAFTER. HOWEVER, THE AMOUNT OF OUR CAPITAL EXPENDITURES HAS FLUCTUATED AND MAY CONTINUE TO FLUCTUATE ON A QUARTERLY BASIS.\nIN ADDITION, WE EXPECT TO CONTINUE TO SPEND CASH ON ACQUISITIONS AND OTHER INVESTMENTS. THESE ACQUISITIONS GENERALLY ENHANCE THE BREADTH AND DEPTH OF OUR EXPERTISE IN ENGINEERING AND OTHER FUNCTIONAL AREAS, OUR TECHNOLOGIES, AND OUR PRODUCT AND SERVICE OFFERINGS.\nCASH PROVIDED BY (USED IN) FINANCING ACTIVITIES\nCASH PROVIDED BY OR USED IN FINANCING ACTIVITIES CONSISTS PRIMARILY OF NET PROCEEDS OR PAYMENTS FROM ISSUANCE OR REPAYMENTS OF SHORT-TERM DEBT UNDER OUR COMMERCIAL PAPER PROGRAM AND NET PROCEEDS OR PAYMENTS AND EXCESS TAX BENEFITS FROM STOCK-BASED AWARD ACTIVITIES.\nCASH USED IN FINANCING ACTIVITIES INCREASED FROM 2012 TO 2013, PRIMARILY DRIVEN BY AN INCREASE IN NET CASH PAYMENTS RELATED TO DEBT AND, TO A LESSER EXTENT, AN INCREASE IN NET PAYMENTS FOR STOCK-BASED AWARD ACTIVITIES.\nCASH PROVIDED BY FINANCING ACTIVITIES INCREASED FROM 2011 TO 2012, PRIMARILY DRIVEN BY AN INCREASE IN NET CASH PROCEEDS RECEIVED RELATED TO DEBT, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY AN INCREASE IN NET PAYMENTS FOR STOCK-BASED AWARD ACTIVITIES.\nCONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS AS OF\nDECEMBER 31, 2013\nPAYMENTS DUE BY PERIOD\nTOTAL\nLESS THAN\n1 YEAR\n1-3\nYEARS\n3-5\nYEARS\nMORE THAN\n5 YEARS\n(IN MILLIONS)\nOPERATING LEASE OBLIGATIONS, NET OF SUBLEASE INCOME AMOUNTS\n$4,038\n$499\n$915\n$788\n$1,836\nPURCHASE OBLIGATIONS AND OTHER\n3,293\n2,407\n680\n80\n126\nLONG-TERM DEBT OBLIGATIONS, INCLUDING CAPITAL LEASE OBLIGATIONS\n3,601\n1,079\n1,358\n73\n1,091\nOTHER LONG-TERM LIABILITIES REFLECTED ON OUR BALANCE SHEET\n251\n114\n48\n55\n34\nTOTAL CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS\n$11,183\n$4,099\n$3,001\n$996\n$3,087\n40\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nOPERATING LEASES\nWE HAVE ENTERED INTO VARIOUS NON-CANCELABLE OPERATING LEASE AGREEMENTS FOR CERTAIN OF OUR OFFICES, LAND, AND DATA CENTERS THROUGHOUT THE WORLD WITH ORIGINAL LEASE PERIODS EXPIRING PRIMARILY BETWEEN 2014 AND 2063. WE ARE COMMITTED TO PAY A PORTION OF THE RELATED OPERATING EXPENSES UNDER CERTAIN OF THESE LEASE AGREEMENTS. THESE OPERATING EXPENSES ARE NOT INCLUDED IN THE ABOVE TABLE. CERTAIN OF THESE LEASES HAVE FREE OR ESCALATING RENT PAYMENT PROVISIONS. WE RECOGNIZE RENT EXPENSE UNDER SUCH LEASES ON A STRAIGHT-LINE BASIS OVER THE TERM OF THE LEASE. CERTAIN LEASES HAVE ADJUSTMENTS FOR MARKET PROVISIONS.\nPURCHASE OBLIGATIONS\nPURCHASE OBLIGATIONS REPRESENT NON-CANCELABLE CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS AT\nDECEMBER 31, 2013\n. THESE CONTRACTS ARE PRIMARILY RELATED TO CERTAIN OF OUR DISTRIBUTION ARRANGEMENTS, VIDEO AND OTHER CONTENT LICENSING REVENUE SHARING ARRANGEMENTS, DATA CENTER OPERATIONS AND FACILITY BUILD-OUTS, AS WELL AS PURCHASE OF INVENTORY.\nLONG-TERM DEBT OBLIGATIONS\nLONG-TERM DEBT OBLIGATIONS REPRESENT PRINCIPAL AND INTEREST PAYMENTS TO BE MADE OVER THE LIFE OF OUR UNSECURED SENIOR NOTES ISSUED IN MAY 2011 AND OUR CAPITAL LEASE OBLIGATION INCURRED IN AUGUST 2013. PLEASE SEE NOTE 4 OF THE NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS INCLUDED IN ITEM 8 OF THIS ANNUAL REPORT ON FORM 10-K FOR FURTHER DETAILS.\nOTHER LONG-TERM LIABILITIES\nOTHER LONG-TERM LIABILITIES REPRESENT CASH OBLIGATIONS RECORDED ON OUR CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS, INCLUDING THE SHORT-TERM PORTION OF THESE LONG-TERM LIABILITIES AND CONSIST PRIMARILY OF PAYMENTS OWED IN CONNECTION WITH CERTAIN INVESTMENTS AND ASSET RETIREMENT OBLIGATIONS.\nIN ADDITION TO THE AMOUNTS ABOVE, WE HAD LONG-TERM TAXES PAYABLE OF $2.7 BILLION AS OF\nDECEMBER 31, 2013\nRELATED TO TAX POSITIONS FOR WHICH THE TIMING OF THE ULTIMATE RESOLUTION IS UNCERTAIN. AT THIS TIME, WE ARE UNABLE TO MAKE A REASONABLY RELIABLE ESTIMATE OF THE TIMING OF PAYMENTS IN INDIVIDUAL YEARS BEYOND 12 MONTHS DUE TO UNCERTAINTIES IN THE TIMING OF TAX AUDIT OUTCOMES. AS A RESULT, THIS AMOUNT IS NOT INCLUDED IN THE ABOVE TABLE.\nOFF-BALANCE SHEET ENTITIES\nAS OF\nDECEMBER 31, 2013\n, WE DID NOT HAVE ANY OFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS, AS DEFINED IN ITEM 303(A)(4)(II) OF REGULATION S-K PROMULGATED BY THE SEC, THAT HAVE OR ARE REASONABLY LIKELY TO HAVE A CURRENT OR FUTURE EFFECT ON OUR FINANCIAL CONDITION, CHANGES IN OUR FINANCIAL CONDITION, REVENUES, OR EXPENSES, RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, LIQUIDITY, CAPITAL EXPENDITURES, OR CAPITAL RESOURCES THAT IS MATERIAL TO INVESTORS.\nCRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES\nWE PREPARE OUR CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS IN ACCORDANCE WITH U.S. GENERALLY ACCEPTED ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES (GAAP.) IN DOING SO, WE HAVE TO MAKE ESTIMATES AND ASSUMPTIONS THAT AFFECT OUR REPORTED AMOUNTS OF ASSETS, LIABILITIES, REVENUES, AND EXPENSES, AS WELL AS RELATED DISCLOSURE OF CONTINGENT ASSETS AND LIABILITIES. IN SOME CASES, WE COULD REASONABLY HAVE USED DIFFERENT ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES. IN SOME CASES, CHANGES IN THE ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES ARE REASONABLY LIKELY TO OCCUR FROM PERIOD TO PERIOD. ACCORDINGLY, ACTUAL RESULTS COULD DIFFER MATERIALLY FROM OUR ESTIMATES. TO THE EXTENT THAT THERE ARE MATERIAL DIFFERENCES BETWEEN THESE ESTIMATES AND ACTUAL RESULTS, OUR FINANCIAL CONDITION OR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS WILL BE AFFECTED. WE BASE OUR ESTIMATES ON PAST EXPERIENCE AND OTHER ASSUMPTIONS THAT WE BELIEVE ARE REASONABLE UNDER THE CIRCUMSTANCES, AND WE EVALUATE THESE ESTIMATES ON AN ONGOING BASIS. WE REFER TO ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES OF THIS TYPE AS CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES, WHICH WE DISCUSS FURTHER BELOW. WE HAVE REVIEWED OUR CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES WITH THE AUDIT COMMITTEE OF OUR BOARD OF DIRECTORS.\nINCOME TAXES\nWE ARE SUBJECT TO INCOME TAXES IN THE U.S. AND NUMEROUS FOREIGN JURISDICTIONS. SIGNIFICANT JUDGMENT IS REQUIRED IN EVALUATING OUR UNCERTAIN TAX POSITIONS AND DETERMINING OUR PROVISION FOR INCOME TAXES.\nALTHOUGH WE BELIEVE WE HAVE ADEQUATELY RESERVED FOR OUR UNCERTAIN TAX POSITIONS, NO ASSURANCE CAN BE GIVEN THAT THE FINAL TAX OUTCOME OF THESE MATTERS WILL NOT BE DIFFERENT. WE ADJUST THESE RESERVES IN LIGHT OF CHANGING FACTS AND CIRCUMSTANCES, SUCH AS THE CLOSING OF A TAX AUDIT OR THE REFINEMENT OF AN ESTIMATE. TO THE EXTENT THAT THE FINAL TAX OUTCOME OF THESE MATTERS IS DIFFERENT THAN THE AMOUNTS RECORDED, SUCH DIFFERENCES WILL IMPACT THE PROVISION FOR INCOME\n41\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nTAXES IN THE PERIOD IN WHICH SUCH DETERMINATION IS MADE. THE PROVISION FOR INCOME TAXES INCLUDES THE IMPACT OF RESERVE PROVISIONS AND CHANGES TO RESERVES THAT ARE CONSIDERED APPROPRIATE, AS WELL AS THE RELATED NET INTEREST AND PENALTIES.\nOUR EFFECTIVE TAX RATES HAVE DIFFERED FROM THE STATUTORY RATE PRIMARILY DUE TO THE TAX IMPACT OF FOREIGN OPERATIONS, STATE TAXES, CERTAIN BENEFITS REALIZED RELATED TO STOCK-BASED AWARD ACTIVITIES, AND RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT TAX CREDITS. THE EFFECTIVE TAX RATES WERE 21.0%, 19.4%, AND 15.7% FOR\n2011\n,\n2012\n, AND\n2013\n. OUR FUTURE EFFECTIVE TAX RATES COULD BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED BY EARNINGS BEING LOWER THAN ANTICIPATED IN COUNTRIES THAT HAVE LOWER STATUTORY RATES AND HIGHER THAN ANTICIPATED IN COUNTRIES THAT HAVE HIGHER STATUTORY RATES, THE NET GAINS AND LOSSES RECOGNIZED BY LEGAL ENTITIES ON CERTAIN HEDGES AND RELATED HEDGED INTERCOMPANY AND OTHER TRANSACTIONS UNDER OUR FOREIGN EXCHANGE RISK MANAGEMENT PROGRAM, CHANGES IN THE VALUATION OF OUR DEFERRED TAX ASSETS OR LIABILITIES, OR CHANGES IN TAX LAWS, REGULATIONS, OR ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES, AS WELL AS CERTAIN DISCRETE ITEMS. IN ADDITION, WE ARE SUBJECT TO THE CONTINUOUS EXAMINATION OF OUR INCOME TAX RETURNS BY THE IRS AND OTHER TAX AUTHORITIES WHICH MAY ASSERT ASSESSMENTS AGAINST US. WE REGULARLY ASSESS THE LIKELIHOOD OF ADVERSE OUTCOMES RESULTING FROM THESE EXAMINATIONS AND ASSESSMENTS TO DETERMINE THE ADEQUACY OF OUR PROVISION FOR INCOME TAXES.\nLOSS CONTINGENCIES\nWE ARE REGULARLY SUBJECT TO CLAIMS, SUITS, GOVERNMENT INVESTIGATIONS, AND OTHER PROCEEDINGS INVOLVING COMPETITION AND ANTITRUST, INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY, PRIVACY, INDIRECT TAXES, LABOR AND EMPLOYMENT, COMMERCIAL DISPUTES, CONTENT GENERATED BY OUR USERS, GOODS AND SERVICES OFFERED BY ADVERTISERS OR PUBLISHERS USING OUR PLATFORMS, AND OTHER MATTERS. CERTAIN OF THESE MATTERS INCLUDE SPECULATIVE CLAIMS FOR SUBSTANTIAL OR INDETERMINATE AMOUNTS OF DAMAGES. WE RECORD A LIABILITY WHEN WE BELIEVE THAT IT IS BOTH PROBABLE THAT A LOSS HAS BEEN INCURRED, AND THE AMOUNT CAN BE REASONABLY ESTIMATED. IF WE DETERMINE THAT A LOSS IS POSSIBLE AND A RANGE OF THE LOSS CAN BE REASONABLY ESTIMATED, WE DISCLOSE THE RANGE OF THE POSSIBLE LOSS IN THE NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS. WE EVALUATE, ON A MONTHLY BASIS, DEVELOPMENTS IN OUR LEGAL MATTERS THAT COULD AFFECT THE AMOUNT OF LIABILITY THAT HAS BEEN PREVIOUSLY ACCRUED, AND THE MATTERS AND RELATED RANGES OF POSSIBLE LOSSES DISCLOSED, AND MAKE ADJUSTMENTS AND CHANGES TO OUR DISCLOSURES AS APPROPRIATE. SIGNIFICANT JUDGMENT IS REQUIRED TO DETERMINE BOTH LIKELIHOOD OF THERE BEING AND THE ESTIMATED AMOUNT OF A LOSS RELATED TO SUCH MATTERS. UNTIL THE FINAL RESOLUTION OF SUCH MATTERS, THERE MAY BE AN EXPOSURE TO LOSS IN EXCESS OF THE AMOUNT RECORDED, AND SUCH AMOUNTS COULD BE MATERIAL. SHOULD ANY OF OUR ESTIMATES AND ASSUMPTIONS CHANGE OR PROVE TO HAVE BEEN INCORRECT, IT COULD HAVE A MATERIAL IMPACT ON OUR BUSINESS, CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL POSITION, RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, OR CASH FLOWS. SEE NOTE 11 OF NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS INCLUDED IN ITEM 8 OF THIS ANNUAL REPORT ON FORM 10-K FOR ADDITIONAL INFORMATION REGARDING CONTINGENCIES.\nBUSINESS COMBINATIONS\nWE ALLOCATE THE FAIR VALUE OF PURCHASE CONSIDERATION TO THE TANGIBLE ASSETS ACQUIRED, LIABILITIES ASSUMED AND INTANGIBLE ASSETS ACQUIRED BASED ON THEIR ESTIMATED FAIR VALUES. THE EXCESS OF THE FAIR VALUE OF PURCHASE CONSIDERATION OVER THE FAIR VALUES OF THESE IDENTIFIABLE ASSETS AND LIABILITIES IS RECORDED AS GOODWILL. WHEN DETERMINING THE FAIR VALUES OF ASSETS ACQUIRED AND LIABILITIES ASSUMED, MANAGEMENT MAKES SIGNIFICANT ESTIMATES AND ASSUMPTIONS, ESPECIALLY WITH RESPECT TO INTANGIBLE ASSETS.\nCRITICAL ESTIMATES IN VALUING CERTAIN INTANGIBLE ASSETS INCLUDE BUT ARE NOT LIMITED TO FUTURE EXPECTED CASH FLOWS FROM CUSTOMER RELATIONSHIPS AND ACQUIRED PATENTS AND DEVELOPED TECHNOLOGY; AND DISCOUNT RATES. MANAGEMENT\u2019S ESTIMATES OF FAIR VALUE ARE BASED UPON ASSUMPTIONS BELIEVED TO BE REASONABLE, BUT WHICH ARE INHERENTLY UNCERTAIN AND UNPREDICTABLE AND, AS A RESULT, ACTUAL RESULTS MAY DIFFER FROM ESTIMATES.\nOTHER ESTIMATES ASSOCIATED WITH THE ACCOUNTING FOR ACQUISITIONS MAY CHANGE AS ADDITIONAL INFORMATION BECOMES AVAILABLE REGARDING THE ASSETS ACQUIRED AND LIABILITIES ASSUMED, AS MORE FULLY DISCUSSED IN NOTE 6 OF NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS INCLUDED IN ITEM 8 OF THIS ANNUAL REPORT ON FORM 10-K.\nGOODWILL\nGOODWILL IS ALLOCATED TO REPORTING UNITS EXPECTED TO BENEFIT FROM THE BUSINESS COMBINATION. WE TEST GOODWILL FOR IMPAIRMENT AT THE REPORTING UNIT LEVEL AT LEAST ANNUALLY, OR MORE FREQUENTLY IF EVENTS OR CHANGES IN CIRCUMSTANCES OCCUR THAT WOULD MORE LIKELY THAN NOT REDUCE THE FAIR VALUE OF A REPORTING UNIT BELOW ITS CARRYING VALUE. WE EVALUATE OUR REPORTING UNITS ON AN ANNUAL BASIS AND, IF NECESSARY, REASSIGN GOODWILL USING A RELATIVE FAIR VALUE ALLOCATION APPROACH. GOODWILL IMPAIRMENT TESTS REQUIRE JUDGMENT, INCLUDING THE IDENTIFICATION OF REPORTING UNITS, ASSIGNMENT OF ASSETS AND LIABILITIES TO REPORTING UNITS, ASSIGNMENT OF GOODWILL TO REPORTING UNITS, AND DETERMINATION OF THE FAIR VALUE OF EACH REPORTING UNIT. AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2013, NO IMPAIRMENT OF GOODWILL HAS BEEN IDENTIFIED.\n42\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nIMPAIRMENT OF MARKETABLE AND NON-MARKETABLE SECURITIES\nWE PERIODICALLY REVIEW OUR MARKETABLE AND NON-MARKETABLE SECURITIES FOR IMPAIRMENT. IF WE CONCLUDE THAT ANY OF THESE INVESTMENTS ARE IMPAIRED, WE DETERMINE WHETHER SUCH IMPAIRMENT IS OTHER-THAN-TEMPORARY. FACTORS WE CONSIDER TO MAKE SUCH DETERMINATION INCLUDE THE DURATION AND SEVERITY OF THE IMPAIRMENT, THE REASON FOR THE DECLINE IN VALUE AND THE POTENTIAL RECOVERY PERIOD AND OUR INTENT TO SELL. FOR MARKETABLE DEBT SECURITIES, WE ALSO CONSIDER WHETHER (1) IT IS MORE LIKELY THAN NOT THAT WE WILL BE REQUIRED TO SELL THE SECURITY BEFORE RECOVERY OF ITS AMORTIZED COST BASIS, AND (2) THE AMORTIZED COST BASIS CANNOT BE RECOVERED AS A RESULT OF CREDIT LOSSES. IF ANY IMPAIRMENT IS CONSIDERED OTHER-THAN-TEMPORARY, WE WILL WRITE DOWN THE ASSET TO ITS FAIR VALUE AND RECORD THE CORRESPONDING CHARGE AS INTEREST AND OTHER INCOME, NET.","30831":"ITEM 7.\nMANAGEMENT\u0092S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nFORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS\nIN\nADDITION TO CURRENT AND HISTORICAL INFORMATION, THIS ANNUAL REPORT ON FORM 10-K CONTAINS FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS WITHIN THE MEANING OF THE PRIVATE SECURITIES LITIGATION REFORM ACT OF 1995.

REVENUE EX-TAC IS A NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURE DEFINED AS GAAP REVENUE LESS TRAFFIC ACQUISITION COSTS (\u0093TAC\u0094). TAC CONSISTS OF PAYMENTS MADE TO AFFILIATES THAT HAVE INTEGRATED OUR ADVERTISING OFFERINGS INTO THEIR SITES AND\nPAYMENTS MADE TO COMPANIES THAT DIRECT CONSUMER AND BUSINESS TRAFFIC TO YAHOO PROPERTIES. BASED ON THE TERMS OF THE SEARCH AGREEMENT WITH MICROSOFT DESCRIBED UNDER \u0093SIGNIFICANT TRANSACTIONS\u0094 BELOW, MICROSOFT RETAINS A REVENUE SHARE OF 12\nPERCENT OF THE NET (AFTER TAC) SEARCH REVENUE GENERATED ON YAHOO PROPERTIES AND AFFILIATE SITES IN TRANSITIONED MARKETS. WE REPORT THE NET REVENUE WE RECEIVE UNDER THE SEARCH AGREEMENT AS REVENUE AND NO LONGER PRESENT THE ASSOCIATED TAC.\nACCORDINGLY, FOR TRANSITIONED MARKETS WE REPORT GAAP REVENUE ASSOCIATED WITH THE SEARCH AGREEMENT ON A NET (AFTER TAC) BASIS RATHER THAN A GROSS BASIS. FOR MARKETS THAT HAD NOT YET TRANSITIONED, REVENUE CONTINUED TO BE RECORDED ON A GROSS\n(BEFORE TAC) BASIS, AND TAC IS RECORDED AS A PART OF OPERATING EXPENSES.\nWE PRESENT REVENUE EX-TAC TO PROVIDE INVESTORS A METRIC USED BY US\nFOR EVALUATION AND DECISION-MAKING PURPOSES DURING THE MICROSOFT TRANSITION AND TO PROVIDE INVESTORS WITH COMPARABLE REVENUE NUMBERS WHEN COMPARING PERIODS PRECEDING, DURING AND FOLLOWING THE TRANSITION PERIOD. A LIMITATION OF REVENUE EX-TAC IS THAT\nIT IS A MEASURE WHICH WE HAVE DEFINED FOR INTERNAL AND INVESTOR PURPOSES THAT MAY BE UNIQUE TO US, AND THEREFORE IT MAY NOT ENHANCE THE COMPARABILITY OF OUR RESULTS TO OTHER COMPANIES IN OUR INDUSTRY WHO HAVE SIMILAR BUSINESS\n40\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nARRANGEMENTS BUT ADDRESS THE IMPACT OF TAC DIFFERENTLY. MANAGEMENT COMPENSATES FOR THESE LIMITATIONS BY ALSO RELYING ON THE COMPARABLE GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES OF REVENUE AND TOTAL OPERATING\nEXPENSES, WHICH INCLUDE TAC IN NON-TRANSITIONED MARKETS.\nADJUSTED EBITDA\n. ADJUSTED EBITDA IS A NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURE DEFINED AS\nNET INCOME ATTRIBUTABLE TO YAHOO! INC. BEFORE TAXES, DEPRECIATION, AMORTIZATION OF INTANGIBLE ASSETS, STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION EXPENSE, OTHER INCOME, NET (WHICH INCLUDES INTEREST), EARNINGS IN EQUITY INTERESTS, NET INCOME ATTRIBUTABLE TO\nNONCONTROLLING INTERESTS, AND CERTAIN GAINS, LOSSES, AND EXPENSES THAT WE DO NOT BELIEVE ARE INDICATIVE OF OUR ONGOING RESULTS.\nWE PRESENT\nADJUSTED EBITDA BECAUSE THE EXCLUSION OF CERTAIN GAINS, LOSSES, AND EXPENSES FACILITATES COMPARISONS OF THE OPERATING PERFORMANCE OF OUR COMPANY ON A PERIOD TO PERIOD BASIS. ADJUSTED EBITDA HAS LIMITATIONS AS AN ANALYTICAL TOOL AND SHOULD NOT BE\nCONSIDERED IN ISOLATION OR AS A SUBSTITUTE FOR RESULTS REPORTED UNDER GAAP. THESE LIMITATIONS INCLUDE: ADJUSTED EBITDA DOES NOT REFLECT TAX PAYMENTS AND SUCH PAYMENTS REFLECT A REDUCTION IN CASH AVAILABLE TO US; ADJUSTED EBITDA DOES NOT REFLECT THE\nPERIODIC COSTS OF CERTAIN CAPITALIZED TANGIBLE AND INTANGIBLE ASSETS USED IN GENERATING REVENUES IN OUR BUSINESSES; ADJUSTED EBITDA DOES NOT INCLUDE STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION EXPENSE RELATED TO OUR WORKFORCE; ADJUSTED EBITDA ALSO EXCLUDES OTHER\nINCOME, NET (WHICH INCLUDES INTEREST), EARNINGS IN EQUITY INTERESTS, NET INCOME ATTRIBUTABLE TO NONCONTROLLING INTERESTS AND CERTAIN GAINS, LOSSES, AND EXPENSES THAT WE DO NOT BELIEVE ARE INDICATIVE OF OUR ONGOING RESULTS, AND THESE ITEMS MAY\nREPRESENT A REDUCTION OR INCREASE IN CASH AVAILABLE TO US. ADJUSTED EBITDA IS A MEASURE THAT MAY BE UNIQUE TO US, AND THEREFORE IT MAY NOT ENHANCE THE COMPARABILITY OF OUR RESULTS TO OTHER COMPANIES IN OUR INDUSTRY. MANAGEMENT COMPENSATES FOR THESE\nLIMITATIONS BY ALSO RELYING ON THE COMPARABLE GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURE OF NET INCOME ATTRIBUTABLE TO YAHOO! INC., WHICH INCLUDES TAXES, DEPRECIATION, AMORTIZATION, STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION EXPENSE, OTHER INCOME, NET (WHICH INCLUDES INTEREST), EARNINGS\nIN EQUITY INTERESTS, NET INCOME ATTRIBUTABLE TO NONCONTROLLING INTERESTS AND THE OTHER GAINS, LOSSES AND EXPENSES THAT ARE EXCLUDED FROM ADJUSTED EBITDA.\nFREE CASH FLOW\n. FREE CASH FLOW IS A NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURE DEFINED AS NET CASH PROVIDED BY (USED IN) OPERATING ACTIVITIES (ADJUSTED TO INCLUDE EXCESS TAX BENEFITS FROM STOCK-BASED AWARDS), LESS\n(I) ACQUISITION OF PROPERTY AND EQUIPMENT, NET AND (II) DIVIDENDS RECEIVED FROM EQUITY INVESTEES.\nWE CONSIDER FREE CASH FLOW TO BE\nA LIQUIDITY MEASURE WHICH PROVIDES USEFUL INFORMATION TO MANAGEMENT AND INVESTORS ABOUT THE AMOUNT OF CASH GENERATED BY THE BUSINESS AFTER THE ACQUISITION OF PROPERTY AND EQUIPMENT, WHICH CAN THEN BE USED FOR STRATEGIC OPPORTUNITIES INCLUDING, AMONG\nOTHERS, INVESTING IN OUR BUSINESS, MAKING STRATEGIC ACQUISITIONS, STRENGTHENING THE BALANCE SHEET, AND REPURCHASING STOCK. A LIMITATION OF FREE CASH FLOW IS THAT IT DOES NOT REPRESENT THE TOTAL INCREASE OR DECREASE IN THE CASH BALANCE FOR THE\nPERIOD. MANAGEMENT COMPENSATES FOR THE LIMITATION OF FREE CASH FLOW BY ALSO RELYING ON THE NET CHANGE IN CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS AS PRESENTED IN OUR CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF CASH FLOWS PREPARED IN ACCORDANCE WITH GAAP WHICH INCORPORATES ALL CASH\nMOVEMENTS DURING THE PERIOD.\nSIGNIFICANT TRANSACTIONS\nACQUISITION OF TUMBLR\nON JUNE 19, 2013, WE COMPLETED THE ACQUISITION OF\nTUMBLR, INC.

WE RETURNED $3.65 BILLION OF THESE AFTER-TAX PROCEEDS TO SHAREHOLDERS.\nIN CONNECTION WITH THE INITIAL REPURCHASE, WE ALSO RECEIVED $800 MILLION IN ALIBABA GROUP PREFERENCE SHARES. ON MAY 16, 2013, WE RECEIVED $846\nMILLION IN CASH FROM ALIBABA GROUP TO REDEEM THE ALIBABA GROUP PREFERENCE SHARES. THE CASH RECEIVED REPRESENTED THE REDEMPTION VALUE, WHICH INCLUDED THE STATED VALUE OF $800 MILLION PLUS ACCRUED DIVIDENDS OF $46 MILLION.\nTHE COMPANY, YAHOO! HONG KONG HOLDINGS LIMITED (\u0093YHK\u0094) AND ALIBABA GROUP ENTERED INTO A SECOND AMENDMENT TO THE SHARE REPURCHASE AND PREFERENCE\nSHARE SALE AGREEMENT, DATED AS OF OCTOBER 14, 2013. THE AMENDMENT REDUCED THE MAXIMUM NUMBER OF SHARES OF ALIBABA GROUP THAT WE ARE REQUIRED TO SELL IN CONNECTION WITH AN INITIAL PUBLIC OFFERING OF ALIBABA GROUP MEETING CERTAIN SPECIFIED\nCRITERIA (A \u0093QUALIFIED IPO\u0094) FROM 261.5 MILLION SHARES TO 208.0 MILLION SHARES.\nCONVERTIBLE SENIOR NOTES\nIN 2013, WE COMPLETED THE OFFERING OF $1.4375 BILLION AGGREGATE PRINCIPAL AMOUNT OF OUR 0.00% CONVERTIBLE SENIOR NOTES DUE IN 2018\n(THE \u0093NOTES\u0094). THE NOTES WERE SOLD IN A PRIVATE PLACEMENT UNDER A PURCHASE AGREEMENT, DATED NOVEMBER 20, 2013, THAT WE ENTERED INTO WITH J.P. MORGAN SECURITIES LLC AND GOLDMAN, SACHS & CO., AS REPRESENTATIVES OF THE SEVERAL\nINITIAL PURCHASERS NAMED THEREIN (COLLECTIVELY, THE \u0093INITIAL PURCHASERS\u0094), FOR RESALE TO QUALIFIED INSTITUTIONAL BUYERS PURSUANT TO RULE 144A UNDER THE SECURITIES ACT OF 1933, AS AMENDED (THE \u0093SECURITIES ACT\u0094). IN CONNECTION WITH\nTHE ISSUANCE OF THE NOTES, WE ENTERED INTO NOTE HEDGE TRANSACTIONS WITH THE INITIAL PURCHASERS (IN SUCH CAPACITY, THE \u0093OPTION COUNTERPARTIES\u0094) TO REDUCE THE POTENTIAL DILUTION WITH RESPECT TO OUR COMMON STOCK UPON CONVERSION OF THE NOTES\nOR OFFSET ANY CASH PAYMENT WE WOULD BE REQUIRED TO MAKE IN EXCESS OF THE PRINCIPAL AMOUNT OF CONVERTED NOTES. FOR THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2013, WE USED $206 MILLION TO PAY THE COST OF THE PRIVATELY NEGOTIATED NOTE HEDGE TRANSACTIONS.\nSEPARATELY, WE ENTERED INTO PRIVATELY NEGOTIATED WARRANT TRANSACTIONS WITH THE OPTION COUNTERPARTIES GIVING THEM THE RIGHT TO PURCHASE YAHOO COMMON STOCK FROM US. THE WARRANT TRANSACTIONS WILL HAVE A DILUTIVE EFFECT WITH RESPECT TO OUR COMMON STOCK\nTO THE EXTENT THAT THE MARKET PRICE PER SHARE OF OUR COMMON STOCK EXCEEDS THE $71.24 STRIKE PRICE OF THE WARRANTS ON OR PRIOR TO THE EXPIRATION DATE OF THE WARRANTS. FOR THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2013, WE RECEIVED $125 MILLION FROM THE\nISSUANCE OF WARRANTS.\nCONCURRENT WITH THE OFFERING, WE ALSO USED APPROXIMATELY $87.5 MILLION OF THE NET PROCEEDS FROM THE SALE OF THE NOTES\nTO REPURCHASE APPROXIMATELY 2.5 MILLION SHARES OF OUR COMMON STOCK. WE EXPECT TO USE THE REMAINDER OF THE NET PROCEEDS FROM THE SALE OF THE NOTES FOR GENERAL CORPORATE PURPOSES, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, ACQUISITIONS OR OTHER STRATEGIC\nTRANSACTIONS, ADDITIONAL REPURCHASES OF COMMON STOCK AND WORKING CAPITAL. FOR ADDITIONAL INFORMATION SEE \u0093ITEM 5\u0097RECENT SALES OF UNREGISTERED SECURITIES\u0094 AND NOTE 11\u0097\u0093CONVERTIBLE NOTES\u0094 IN THE NOTES TO OUR CONSOLIDATED\nFINANCIAL STATEMENTS.\nSEARCH AGREEMENT WITH MICROSOFT CORPORATION\nON DECEMBER 4, 2009, WE ENTERED INTO A SEARCH AND ADVERTISING SERVICES AND SALES AGREEMENT, AS AMENDED, (THE \u0093SEARCH AGREEMENT\u0094) WITH MICROSOFT CORPORATION (\u0093MICROSOFT\u0094), WHICH\nPROVIDES FOR MICROSOFT TO BE THE EXCLUSIVE ALGORITHMIC AND PAID SEARCH SERVICES PROVIDER ON YAHOO PROPERTIES AND NON-EXCLUSIVE PROVIDER OF SUCH SERVICES ON AFFILIATE SITES. WE ALSO ENTERED INTO A LICENSE AGREEMENT WITH MICROSOFT PURSUANT TO WHICH\nMICROSOFT ACQUIRED AN EXCLUSIVE 10-YEAR LICENSE TO OUR CORE SEARCH TECHNOLOGY THAT IT WILL BE ABLE TO INTEGRATE INTO ITS\n42\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nEXISTING WEB SEARCH PLATFORMS. THE GLOBAL TRANSITION OF OUR ALGORITHMIC AND PAID SEARCH PLATFORMS TO MICROSOFT\u0092S PLATFORM AND THE MIGRATION OF PAID SEARCH ADVERTISERS AND PUBLISHERS TO\nMICROSOFT\u0092S PLATFORM WERE TO BE DONE ON A MARKET BY MARKET BASIS.\nDURING THE FIRST FIVE YEARS OF THE SEARCH AGREEMENT, IN TRANSITIONED\nMARKETS WE ARE ENTITLED TO RECEIVE 88 PERCENT OF THE REVENUE GENERATED FROM MICROSOFT\u0092S SERVICES ON YAHOO PROPERTIES. WE ARE ALSO ENTITLED TO RECEIVE 88 PERCENT OF THE REVENUE GENERATED FROM MICROSOFT\u0092S SERVICES ON AFFILIATE SITES\nAFTER THE AFFILIATE\u0092S SHARE OF REVENUE. IN THE TRANSITIONED MARKETS, FOR SEARCH REVENUE GENERATED FROM MICROSOFT\u0092S SERVICES ON YAHOO PROPERTIES AND AFFILIATE SITES, WE REPORT AS REVENUE THE 88 PERCENT REVENUE SHARE, AS WE ARE NOT THE\nPRIMARY OBLIGOR IN THE ARRANGEMENT WITH THE ADVERTISERS AND PUBLISHERS. THE UNDERLYING SEARCH ADVERTISING SERVICES ARE PROVIDED BY MICROSOFT. FOR NEW AFFILIATES DURING THE TERM OF THE SEARCH AGREEMENT, AND FOR ALL AFFILIATES AFTER THE FIRST FIVE\nYEARS OF SUCH TERM, WE WILL RECEIVE 88 PERCENT OF THE REVENUE GENERATED FROM MICROSOFT\u0092S SERVICES ON AFFILIATE SITES AFTER THE AFFILIATE\u0092S SHARE OF REVENUE AND CERTAIN MICROSOFT COSTS ARE DEDUCTED. UNDER THE SEARCH AGREEMENT, YAHOO IS THE\nEXCLUSIVE WORLDWIDE RELATIONSHIP SALES FORCE FOR BOTH COMPANIES\u0092 PREMIUM SEARCH ADVERTISERS. ON FEBRUARY 23, 2015 (THE FIFTH ANNIVERSARY OF THE DATE THAT IMPLEMENTATION OF THE SEARCH AGREEMENT COMMENCED), MICROSOFT WILL HAVE THE OPTION TO\nTERMINATE OUR SALES EXCLUSIVITY FOR PREMIUM SEARCH ADVERTISERS. IF MICROSOFT EXERCISES ITS OPTION, THE REVENUE SHARE RATE WILL INCREASE TO 93 PERCENT FOR THE REMAINDER OF THE TERM OF THE SEARCH AGREEMENT, UNLESS WE EXERCISE OUR OPTION TO RETAIN OUR\nSALES EXCLUSIVITY, IN WHICH CASE THE REVENUE SHARE RATE WOULD BE REDUCED TO 83 PERCENT FOR THE REMAINDER OF THE TERM. IF MICROSOFT DOES NOT EXERCISE SUCH OPTION, THE REVENUE SHARE RATE WILL BE 90 PERCENT FOR THE REMAINDER OF THE TERM OF THE SEARCH\nAGREEMENT.\nTHE TERM OF THE SEARCH AGREEMENT IS 10 YEARS FROM FEBRUARY 23, 2010, SUBJECT TO EARLIER TERMINATION AS PROVIDED IN THE SEARCH\nAGREEMENT. REVENUE UNDER THE SEARCH AGREEMENT REPRESENTED APPROXIMATELY 20 PERCENT, 25 PERCENT, AND 31 PERCENT OF OUR REVENUE FOR THE YEARS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2011, 2012 AND, 2013, RESPECTIVELY.\nUNDER THE SEARCH AGREEMENT, FOR EACH MARKET, MICROSOFT GENERALLY GUARANTEES YAHOO\u0092S REVENUE PER SEARCH (\u0093RPS GUARANTEE\u0094) ON YAHOO\nPROPERTIES ONLY FOR 18 MONTHS AFTER THE TRANSITION OF PAID SEARCH SERVICES TO MICROSOFT\u0092S PLATFORM IN THAT MARKET. THE RPS GUARANTEE IS BASED ON THE DIFFERENCE IN REVENUE PER SEARCH BETWEEN THE PRE-TRANSITION AND POST-TRANSITION PERIODS AND\nCERTAIN OTHER FACTORS. WE RECORD THE RPS GUARANTEE AS SEARCH REVENUE IN THE QUARTER THE AMOUNT BECOMES FIXED, WHICH IS TYPICALLY THE QUARTER IN WHICH THE ASSOCIATED SHORTFALL IN REVENUE PER SEARCH OCCURRED. IN THE FOURTH QUARTER OF 2011, MICROSOFT\nAGREED TO EXTEND THE RPS GUARANTEE IN THE U.S. AND CANADA THROUGH MARCH 2013, AND IN THE SECOND QUARTER OF 2013, MICROSOFT EXTENDED THE RPS GUARANTEE IN THE U.S. THROUGH MARCH 2014. IN JUNE 2013, MICROSOFT AND WE AGREED UPON THE RPS GUARANTEE\nPAYMENT AMOUNTS TO BE PAID TO US FOR THE QUARTERS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2012, MARCH 31, 2013 AND JUNE 30, 2013. WE ALSO AGREED TO FIXED QUARTERLY PAYMENTS IN LIEU OF THE RPS GUARANTEE IN THE U.S. FOR THE QUARTERS ENDING\nSEPTEMBER 30, 2013, DECEMBER 31, 2013 AND MARCH 31, 2014. IN ADDITION, WE AGREED TO WAIVE OUR RIGHT TO RECEIVE ANY FUTURE RPS GUARANTEE PAYMENTS IN ALL OTHER MARKETS EXCEPT TAIWAN AND HONG KONG. WE DO NOT EXPECT THE REMAINING\nQUARTERLY PAYMENT FROM MICROSOFT AND ANY RPS GUARANTEE PAYMENTS FOR TAIWAN AND HONG KONG TO HAVE A MATERIAL IMPACT ON OUR EXPECTED FUTURE REVENUE.\nUNDER THE SEARCH AGREEMENT, MICROSOFT AGREED TO REIMBURSE US FOR CERTAIN TRANSITION COSTS UP TO AN AGGREGATE TOTAL OF $150 MILLION DURING THE FIRST THREE YEARS OF THE SEARCH AGREEMENT. DURING THE THIRD\nQUARTER OF 2011, OUR CUMULATIVE TRANSITION COSTS EXCEEDED MICROSOFT\u0092S $150 MILLION REIMBURSEMENT CAP UNDER THE SEARCH AGREEMENT. TRANSITION COSTS WE INCURRED IN EXCESS OF THE $150 MILLION REIMBURSEMENT CAP WERE NOT SUBJECT TO REIMBURSEMENT. OUR\nRESULTS FOR THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2011 REFLECT THE FINAL TRANSITION COST REIMBURSEMENTS FROM MICROSOFT UNDER THE SEARCH AGREEMENT OF $26 MILLION.\nWE COMPLETED THE TRANSITION OF OUR ALGORITHMIC AND PAID SEARCH PLATFORMS TO THE MICROSOFT PLATFORM IN THE U.S. AND CANADA IN THE FOURTH QUARTER OF 2010. IN 2011, WE COMPLETED THE TRANSITION OF ALGORITHMIC\nSEARCH IN ALL OTHER MARKETS. BY THE END OF 2012, WE HAD COMPLETED THE TRANSITION OF PAID SEARCH IN INDIA, MOST OF THE EMEA MARKETS, AND SIX MARKETS IN LATIN AMERICA. BY THE END OF 2013, WE HAD SUBSTANTIALLY COMPLETED THE TRANSITION OF PAID SEARCH,\nINCLUDING THE TRANSITION OF PAID SEARCH IN TAIWAN AND HONG KONG.\n43\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nFROM FEBRUARY 23, 2010 UNTIL THE APPLICABLE SERVICES WERE FULLY TRANSITIONED TO MICROSOFT IN ALL\nMARKETS, MICROSOFT WAS REQUIRED UNDER THE SEARCH AGREEMENT TO REIMBURSE US FOR THE COSTS OF OPERATING ALGORITHMIC AND PAID SEARCH SERVICES SUBJECT TO SPECIFIED EXCLUSIONS AND LIMITATIONS. OUR RESULTS REFLECT SEARCH OPERATING COST REIMBURSEMENTS FROM\nMICROSOFT UNDER THE SEARCH AGREEMENT OF $49 MILLION, $67 MILLION, AND $212 MILLION FOR THE YEARS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2013, 2012, AND 2011, RESPECTIVELY.\nWE RECORD RECEIVABLES FOR THE REIMBURSEMENTS AS COSTS ARE INCURRED AND APPLY THEM AGAINST THE OPERATING EXPENSE CATEGORIES IN WHICH THE COSTS WERE INCURRED. OF THE TOTAL AMOUNTS INCURRED DURING THE YEARS\nENDED DECEMBER 31, 2012 AND 2013, THE TOTAL REIMBURSEMENTS NOT YET RECEIVED FROM MICROSOFT OF $5 MILLION WERE CLASSIFIED AS PART OF PREPAID EXPENSES AND OTHER CURRENT ASSETS ON OUR CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2012 AND\n2013.\nSEE NOTE 19\u0097\u0093SEARCH AGREEMENT WITH MICROSOFT CORPORATION\u0094 IN THE NOTES TO OUR CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR\nADDITIONAL INFORMATION.\nRESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nYEARS ENDED DECEMBER 31,\n2011-2012% CHANGE\n2012-2013% CHANGE\n2011\n2012\n2013\n(DOLLARS IN THOUSANDS)\nREVENUE FOR GROUPS OF SIMILAR SERVICES.\nDISPLAY\nYAHOO PROPERTIES\n$1,998,312\n$1,930,234\n$1,744,130\n(3)%\n(10)%\nAFFILIATE SITES\n161,997\n212,584\n205,700\n31%\n(3)%\nTOTAL DISPLAY REVENUE\n$2,160,309\n$2,142,818\n$1,949,830\n(1)%\n(9)%\nSEARCH\nYAHOO PROPERTIES\n$1,056,053\n$1,206,209\n$1,371,134\n14%\n14%\nAFFILIATE SITES\n797,057\n679,651\n370,657\n(15)%\n(45)%\nTOTAL SEARCH REVENUE\n$1,853,110\n$1,885,860\n$1,741,791\n2%\n(8)%\nOTHER\n$970,780\n$957,888\n$988,759\n(1)%\n3%\nTOTAL REVENUE\n$4,984,199\n$4,986,566\n$4,680,380\n\u0097\n(6)%\nCOST OF REVENUE\u0097TAC\n603,371\n518,906\n254,442\n(14)%\n(51)%\nCOST OF REVENUE\u0097OTHER\n983,626\n1,101,660\n1,094,938\n12%\n(1)%\nSALES AND MARKETING\n1,122,193\n1,101,572\n1,130,820\n(2)%\n3%\nPRODUCT DEVELOPMENT\n919,368\n885,824\n1,008,487\n(4)%\n14%\nGENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE\n497,288\n540,247\n569,555\n9%\n5%\nAMORTIZATION OF INTANGIBLES\n33,592\n35,819\n44,841\n7%\n25%\nGAINS ON SALES OF PATENTS\n\u0097\n\u0097\n(79,950)\n\u0097\n100%\nGOODWILL IMPAIRMENT CHARGE\n\u0097\n\u0097\n63,555\n\u0097\n100%\nRESTRUCTURING CHARGES, NET\n24,420\n236,170\n3,766\nN\/M\n(98)%\nTOTAL OPERATING EXPENSES\n$4,183,858\n$4,420,198\n$4,090,454\n6%\n(7)%\nINCOME FROM OPERATIONS\n$800,341\n$566,368\n$589,926\n(29)%\n4%\nINCLUDES.\nSTOCK-BASED COMPENSATION EXPENSE\n$203,958\n$224,365\n$278,220\n10%\n24%\nCOSTS ASSOCIATED WITH THE KOREA BUSINESS AND ITS CLOSURE\n$\u0097\n$99,485\n$\u0097\n100%\n(100)%\nN\/M = NOT MEANINGFUL\n44\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nTHE FOLLOWING TABLE SETS FORTH SELECTED INFORMATION CONCERNING OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AS A PERCENTAGE OF\nREVENUE FOR THE PERIOD INDICATED.\nYEARS ENDED DECEMBER 31,\n2011\n2012\n2013\n(DOLLARS IN THOUSANDS)\nREVENUE FOR GROUPS OF SIMILAR SERVICES.\nDISPLAY\nYAHOO PROPERTIES\n40%\n39%\n37%\nAFFILIATE SITES\n3%\n4%\n5%\nTOTAL DISPLAY REVENUE\n43%\n43%\n42%\nSEARCH\nYAHOO PROPERTIES\n21%\n24%\n29%\nAFFILIATE SITES\n16%\n14%\n8%\nTOTAL SEARCH REVENUE\n37%\n38%\n37%\nOTHER\n20%\n19%\n21%\nTOTAL REVENUE\n100%\n100%\n100%\nCOST OF REVENUE\u0097TAC\n12%\n10%\n6%\nCOST OF REVENUE\u0097OTHER\n20%\n22%\n23%\nSALES AND MARKETING\n23%\n22%\n24%\nPRODUCT DEVELOPMENT\n18%\n18%\n22%\nGENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE\n10%\n11%\n12%\nAMORTIZATION OF INTANGIBLES\n1%\n1%\n1%\nGAINS ON SALES OF PATENTS\n\u0097\n\u0097\n(2)%\nGOODWILL IMPAIRMENT CHARGE\n\u0097\n\u0097\n1%\nRESTRUCTURING CHARGES, NET\n\u0097\n5%\n\u0097\nTOTAL OPERATING EXPENSES\n84%\n89%\n87%\nINCOME FROM OPERATIONS\n16%\n11%\n13%\nINCLUDES.\nSTOCK-BASED COMPENSATION EXPENSE\n4%\n4%\n6%\nCOSTS ASSOCIATED WITH THE KOREA BUSINESS AND ITS CLOSURE\n\u0097\n2%\n\u0097\n45\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nMANAGEMENT REPORTING\nWE CONTINUE TO MANAGE OUR BUSINESS GEOGRAPHICALLY.

COST OF REVENUE\u0097OTHER CONSISTS OF\nBANDWIDTH COSTS AND OTHER EXPENSES ASSOCIATED WITH THE PRODUCTION AND USAGE OF YAHOO PROPERTIES, INCLUDING AMORTIZATION OF ACQUIRED INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS AND DEVELOPED TECHNOLOGY.\nREVENUE\nWE GENERATE REVENUE\nPRINCIPALLY FROM DISPLAY AND SEARCH ADVERTISING ON YAHOO PROPERTIES AND AFFILIATE SITES, WITH THE MAJORITY OF OUR REVENUE COMING FROM ADVERTISING ON YAHOO PROPERTIES. OUR MARGINS ON REVENUE FROM YAHOO PROPERTIES ADVERTISING ARE HIGHER THAN OUR\nMARGINS ON REVENUE FROM DISPLAY AND SEARCH ADVERTISING ON AFFILIATE SITES AS WE PAY TAC TO OUR AFFILIATES. ADDITIONALLY, WE GENERATE REVENUE FROM OTHER SOURCES INCLUDING LISTINGS-BASED SERVICES, FACILITATING COMMERCIAL TRANSACTIONS, ROYALTIES, AND\nCONSUMER AND BUSINESS FEE-BASED SERVICES.\nWITH THE SIGNIFICANT PLATFORM SHIFT TO MOBILE DEVICES, INCLUDING SMARTPHONES AND TABLETS, WE HAVE\nINCREASED OUR STRATEGIC FOCUS ON MOBILE PRODUCTS AND MOBILE AD FORMATS. WE HAVE HIRED ENGINEERING AND TECHNICAL TALENT TO HELP US ACCELERATE OUR EFFORTS IN MOBILE DEVELOPMENT, AND INTRODUCED NEW MOBILE APPS AND REFRESHED THE USER EXPERIENCE ON\nMOBILE ACROSS A NUMBER OF YAHOO PROPERTIES, INCLUDING NEWS, SPORTS AND FINANCE. WE ARE SEEING AN INCREASE IN THE NUMBER OF OUR DAILY AND MONTHLY MOBILE USERS AS A RESULT OF THESE PRODUCT IMPROVEMENTS. THE MONETIZATION OF THESE MOBILE\nPRODUCTS IS DRIVEN PRIMARILY THROUGH ADVERTISEMENTS AND WE ARE COMMITTED TO CONTINUING TO DEVELOP AND DELIVER INNOVATIVE AD FORMATS ON MOBILE. WHILE WE SEE A SIGNIFICANT OPPORTUNITY FOR MONETIZATION ON MOBILE, DURING 2013 AND AT PRESENT OUR\nREVENUE FROM MOBILE IS NOT MATERIAL.\nDISPLAY REVENUE\nDISPLAY REVENUE IS GENERATED FROM THE DISPLAY OF GRAPHICAL AND NON-GRAPHICAL ADVERTISEMENTS (\u0093DISPLAY ADVERTISING\u0094). WE EARN REVENUE FROM GUARANTEED OR \u0093PREMIUM\u0094 DISPLAY ADVERTISING BY\nDELIVERING ADVERTISEMENTS ACCORDING TO ADVERTISERS\u0092 SPECIFIED CRITERIA, SUCH AS NUMBER OF IMPRESSIONS DURING A FIXED PERIOD ON A SPECIFIC PLACEMENT. ALSO, WE EARN REVENUE FROM NON-GUARANTEED OR \u0093NON-PREMIUM\u0094 DISPLAY ADVERTISING BY\nDELIVERING ADVERTISEMENTS ON A PREEMPTIBLE BASIS.\nWE RECOGNIZE REVENUE FROM DISPLAY ADVERTISING ON YAHOO PROPERTIES AND AFFILIATE SITES AS\nIMPRESSIONS ARE DELIVERED. IMPRESSIONS ARE DELIVERED WHEN A SOLD ADVERTISEMENT APPEARS IN PAGES VIEWED BY USERS. ARRANGEMENTS FOR THESE SERVICES GENERALLY HAVE TERMS OF UP TO ONE YEAR. FOR DISPLAY ADVERTISING ON AFFILIATE SITES, WE PAY TAC TO\nAFFILIATES FOR THE REVENUE GENERATED FROM THE DISPLAY OF THESE ADVERTISEMENTS ON THE AFFILIATE SITES. THE DISPLAY REVENUE DERIVED FROM THESE ARRANGEMENTS THAT INVOLVE TRAFFIC SUPPLIED BY AFFILIATES IS REPORTED ON A GROSS BASIS (BEFORE DEDUCTING THE\nTAC PAID TO AFFILIATES) AS WE ARE THE PRIMARY OBLIGOR TO THE ADVERTISERS WHO ARE THE CUSTOMERS OF THE DISPLAY ADVERTISING SERVICE.\nDISPLAY\nREVENUE FOR THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2013 DECREASED BY 9 PERCENT, COMPARED TO 2012. THIS DECREASE WAS PRIMARILY ATTRIBUTABLE TO A DECLINE IN NUMBER OF ADS THAT WE SOLD ON A PREMIUM BASIS ON YAHOO PROPERTIES IN THE AMERICAS REGION.\nDISPLAY REVENUE FOR THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2012 DECREASED BY 1 PERCENT, COMPARED TO 2011. THIS DECREASE CAN BE ATTRIBUTED TO A\nDECLINE IN DISPLAY REVENUE ON YAHOO PROPERTIES IN THE EMEA REGION.\nSEARCH REVENUE\nSEARCH REVENUE IS GENERATED FROM CLICKS ON TEXT-BASED LINKS TO ADVERTISERS\u0092 WEBSITES THAT APPEAR PRIMARILY ON SEARCH RESULTS PAGES (\u0093SEARCH\nADVERTISING\u0094). WE RECOGNIZE REVENUE FROM SEARCH ADVERTISING ON YAHOO PROPERTIES\n47\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nAND AFFILIATE SITES. SEARCH REVENUE IS RECOGNIZED BASED ON PAID CLICKS. A PAID CLICK OCCURS WHEN AN END-USER CLICKS ON A SPONSORED LISTING ON YAHOO PROPERTIES OR AFFILIATE SITES FOR WHICH AN\nADVERTISER PAYS ON A PER CLICK BASIS. UNDER THE SEARCH AGREEMENT WITH MICROSOFT, IN TRANSITIONED MARKETS WE REPORT AS REVENUE OUR 88 PERCENT REVENUE SHARE AS WE ARE NOT THE PRIMARY OBLIGOR IN THE ARRANGEMENT WITH THE ADVERTISERS. SEE\n\u0093SIGNIFICANT TRANSACTIONS\u0097SEARCH AGREEMENT WITH MICROSOFT CORPORATION\u0094 ABOVE FOR A DESCRIPTION OF OUR SEARCH AGREEMENT WITH MICROSOFT. IN NON-TRANSITIONED MARKETS, WE PAID AFFILIATES TAC FOR THE REVENUE GENERATED FROM THE SEARCH\nADVERTISEMENTS ON THE AFFILIATES\u0092 WEBSITES. THE REVENUE DERIVED FROM THESE ARRANGEMENTS WAS REPORTED ON A GROSS BASIS (BEFORE DEDUCTING THE TAC PAID TO AFFILIATES), AS WE WERE THE PRIMARY OBLIGOR TO THE ADVERTISERS IN NON-TRANSITIONED MARKETS\nAND WE RECORDED THE RELATED REVENUE AS IT WAS EARNED. WE ALSO GENERATE SEARCH REVENUE FROM A REVENUE SHARING ARRANGEMENT WITH YAHOO JAPAN FOR SEARCH TECHNOLOGY AND SERVICES.\nSEARCH REVENUE FOR THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2013 DECREASED BY 8 PERCENT COMPARED TO 2012. SEARCH REVENUE DECREASED PRIMARILY DUE TO DECLINES IN AFFILIATE REVENUE IN THE ASIA PACIFIC REGION\nRESULTING FROM THE CLOSURE OF OUR KOREA BUSINESS, AND DECLINES IN AFFILIATE REVENUE IN THE EMEA REGION DUE TO THE REQUIRED CHANGE IN REVENUE PRESENTATION FOR TRANSITIONED MARKETS FROM A GROSS (BEFORE TAC) TO A NET (AFTER TAC) BASIS. THIS WAS\nPARTIALLY OFFSET BY INCREASED SEARCH REVENUE IN THE AMERICAS REGION, WHICH RESULTED FROM AN INCREASE IN SPONSORED SEARCHES ON YAHOO PROPERTIES AND HIGHER REVENUE PER SEARCH DUE TO IMPROVED AD FORMATS.\nSEARCH REVENUE FOR THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2012 INCREASED BY 2 PERCENT COMPARED TO 2011. SEARCH REVENUE INCREASED DUE TO INCREASED SEARCH\nREVENUE IN THE AMERICAS REGION WHICH RESULTED FROM AN INCREASE IN SPONSORED SEARCHES ON YAHOO PROPERTIES, AS WELL AS HIGHER REVENUE PER SEARCH. THE INCREASE WAS PARTIALLY OFFSET BY DECREASED SEARCH REVENUE IN THE EMEA REGION AND OTHER MARKETS DUE TO\nTHE REQUIRED CHANGE IN REVENUE PRESENTATION FOR TRANSITIONED MARKETS FROM A GROSS TO A NET (AFTER TAC) BASIS.\nOTHER REVENUE\nOTHER REVENUE INCLUDES LISTINGS-BASED SERVICES REVENUE, TRANSACTION REVENUE, ROYALTIES, AND FEES REVENUE. LISTINGS-BASED SERVICES REVENUE\nIS GENERATED FROM A VARIETY OF CONSUMER AND BUSINESS LISTINGS-BASED SERVICES, INCLUDING CLASSIFIED ADVERTISING. WE RECOGNIZE LISTINGS-BASED SERVICES REVENUE WHEN THE SERVICES ARE PERFORMED. TRANSACTION REVENUE IS GENERATED FROM FACILITATING\nCOMMERCIAL TRANSACTIONS THROUGH YAHOO PROPERTIES, PRINCIPALLY FROM YAHOO SMALL BUSINESS, YAHOO TRAVEL, AND YAHOO SHOPPING. WE RECOGNIZE TRANSACTION REVENUE WHEN THERE IS EVIDENCE THAT QUALIFYING TRANSACTIONS HAVE OCCURRED. WE ALSO RECEIVE ROYALTIES\nFROM JOINT VENTURE PARTNERS THAT ARE RECOGNIZED WHEN EARNED. FEES REVENUE CONSISTS OF REVENUE GENERATED FROM A VARIETY OF CONSUMER AND BUSINESS FEE-BASED SERVICES AS WELL AS SERVICES FOR SMALL BUSINESSES. WE RECOGNIZE FEES REVENUE WHEN THE SERVICES\nARE PERFORMED.\nOTHER REVENUE FOR THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2013 INCREASED BY 3 PERCENT, COMPARED TO 2012. THE INCREASE WAS PRIMARILY\nDUE TO INCREASED ROYALTY REVENUE RESULTING FROM THE AMENDED TIPLA AGREEMENT WITH ALIBABA GROUP. THIS WAS PARTIALLY OFFSET BY A DECREASE IN LISTINGS-BASED REVENUE IN THE AMERICAS REGION.\nOTHER REVENUE FOR THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2012 DECREASED BY 1 PERCENT, COMPARED TO 2011. THERE WAS A DECREASE IN FEES REVENUE FROM CERTAIN OF OUR BROADBAND ACCESS PARTNERSHIPS AND A DECLINE IN\nLISTINGS REVENUE IN THE AMERICAS REGION. THIS DECREASE WAS PARTIALLY OFFSET BY AN INCREASE IN THE AMERICAS REGION DUE TO NEW AND AMENDED PARTNER DEALS, AS WELL AS AN INCREASE IN ROYALTY REVENUE RESULTING FROM THE AMENDED TIPLA AGREEMENT.\nDISPLAY AND SEARCH METRICS\nWE\nPRESENT INFORMATION BELOW REGARDING THE NUMBER OF \u0093ADS SOLD\u0094 AND \u0093PRICE-PER-AD\u0094 FOR DISPLAY AND THE NUMBER OF \u0093PAID CLICKS\u0094 AND \u0093PRICE-PER-CLICK\u0094 FOR SEARCH. THIS INFORMATION IS DERIVED FROM INTERNAL DATA.\n\u0093ADS SOLD\u0094 IS DEFINED AS DISPLAY AD IMPRESSIONS FOR PAYING ADVERTISERS ON YAHOO PROPERTIES. \u0093PRICE-PER-AD\u0094 IS DEFINED AS\nDISPLAY REVENUE FROM YAHOO PROPERTIES DIVIDED BY OUR TOTAL NUMBER OF ADS SOLD. OUR PRICE AND\n48\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nVOLUME METRICS FOR DISPLAY ARE BASED ON DISPLAY REVENUE WHICH WE REPORT ON A GROSS BASIS (BEFORE TAC). OUR PRICE AND VOLUME METRICS FOR DISPLAY EXCLUDE BOTH THE NUMBER OF ADS SOLD AND THE RELATED\nREVENUE FOR CERTAIN REGIONS WHERE WE DID NOT RETAIN HISTORICAL INFORMATION IN A MANNER THAT WOULD SUPPORT PERIOD-TO-PERIOD COMPARISON ON THESE METRICS. THE COUNTRIES AND REGIONS INCLUDED IN OUR DISPLAY METRICS ARE: THE UNITED STATES, THE UNITED\nKINGDOM, FRANCE, GERMANY, SPAIN, ITALY, TAIWAN, HONG KONG, SOUTHEAST ASIA, AND INDIA.\n\u0093PAID CLICKS\u0094 ARE DEFINED AS CLICKS BY\nEND-USERS ON SPONSORED SEARCH LISTINGS ON YAHOO PROPERTIES AND AFFILIATE SITES FOR WHICH AN ADVERTISER PAYS ON A PER CLICK BASIS. \u0093PRICE-PER-CLICK\u0094 IS DEFINED AS SEARCH REVENUE DIVIDED BY OUR TOTAL NUMBER OF PAID CLICKS. OUR PRICE AND\nVOLUME METRICS FOR SEARCH ARE BASED ON GROSS SEARCH REVENUE (BEFORE TAC) IN ALL MARKETS IN WHICH WE OPERATE.\nWE PERIODICALLY REVIEW, REFINE\nAND UPDATE OUR METHODOLOGIES FOR MONITORING, GATHERING, AND COUNTING NUMBERS OF ADS SOLD AND PAID CLICKS AND FOR CALCULATING PRICE-PER-CLICK AND PRICE-PER-AD.\nCOMMENCING IN THE THIRD QUARTER OF 2013, WE MADE THREE UPDATES TO OUR METHODOLOGIES. FIRST, WE NOW INCLUDE THE IMPRESSIONS AND REVENUE ASSOCIATED WITH OUR NEW STREAM AD UNITS, WHICH ARE DISPLAY ADS THAT\nAPPEAR IN THE CONTENT STREAMS VIEWED BY USERS, IN OUR DISPLAY PRICE AND VOLUME METRICS (ADS SOLD AND PRICE-PER-AD). SECOND, TO PROVIDE METRICS THAT ARE MORE CONSISTENT WITH OUR HISTORICAL REVENUE TRENDS, THE REVENUE AND VOLUME ASSOCIATED WITH OTHER\nDISPLAY ADVERTISEMENTS SOLD ON A PRICE-PER-CLICK BASIS HAVE BEEN EXCLUDED FROM OUR SEARCH PRICE AND VOLUME METRICS (PAID CLICKS AND PRICE-PER-CLICK) AND THEY WILL CONTINUE TO BE EXCLUDED FROM OUR DISPLAY PRICE AND VOLUME METRICS. FINALLY, THE\nMICROSOFT RPS GUARANTEE HAS BEEN EXCLUDED FROM THE CALCULATION OF PRICE-PER-CLICK. DUE TO THE CLOSURE OF THE KOREA BUSINESS IN THE FOURTH QUARTER OF 2012, \u0093ADS SOLD,\u0094 \u0093PAID CLICKS,\u0094 \u0093PRICE-PER-AD,\u0094 AND\n\u0093PRICE-PER-CLICK,\u0094 AS PRESENTED BELOW, EXCLUDE THE KOREA MARKET FOR ALL PERIODS PRESENTED.

AS SUCH, THE PROVISION FOR INCOME TAXES FOR THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2013 REFLECTS THE BENEFIT OF\nBOTH THE 2012 AND 2013 FEDERAL RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT TAX CREDITS.\n\u0095\nIN 2012, IN CONNECTION WITH A REVIEW OF OUR CASH POSITION AND ANTICIPATED CASH NEEDS FOR INVESTMENT IN OUR CORE BUSINESS, INCLUDING POTENTIAL\nACQUISITIONS, CAPITAL EXPENDITURES AND STOCK REPURCHASES, WE MADE A ONE-TIME DISTRIBUTION OF CASH FROM CERTAIN OF OUR CONSOLIDATED FOREIGN SUBSIDIARIES RESULTING IN AN OVERALL NET BENEFIT FOR THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2012 OF APPROXIMATELY\n$117 MILLION. THE BENEFIT IS PRIMARILY DUE TO EXCESS FOREIGN TAX CREDITS. OF THE $117 MILLION, $102 MILLION IS INCLUDED ABOVE WITHIN \u0093EFFECT OF NON-U.S. OPERATIONS.\u0094 IN 2013, \u0093EFFECT OF NON-U.S. OPERATIONS\u0094 INCLUDES AN ADDITIONAL\nBENEFIT OF $36 MILLION DUE TO MORE EXCESS FOREIGN TAX CREDITS BECOMING AVAILABLE AS CERTAIN TAX MATTERS WERE RESOLVED WITH VARIOUS TAX AUTHORITIES DURING THE YEAR.\n\u0095\nIN 2013, WE SETTLED THE IRS INCOME TAX EXAMINATION FOR THE 2005 AND 2006 RETURNS RESULTING IN A BENEFIT OF APPROXIMATELY $54 MILLION.\nTHE U.S. DEPARTMENT OF THE TREASURY ISSUED FINAL REGULATIONS ON THE DEDUCTION AND CAPITALIZATION OF EXPENDITURES RELATED TO\nTANGIBLE PROPERTY FOR INCOME TAX PURPOSES. THESE REGULATIONS APPLY TO OUR TAX YEAR BEGINNING ON JANUARY 1, 2014. BASED ON OUR ASSESSMENT AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2013, THESE REGULATIONS WILL NOT HAVE A MATERIAL IMPACT ON OUR CONSOLIDATED\nFINANCIAL POSITION, RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, OR CASH FLOWS.\nAS OF DECEMBER 31, 2013, WE DO NOT ANTICIPATE REPATRIATION OF OUR REMAINING\nUNDISTRIBUTED FOREIGN EARNINGS OF APPROXIMATELY $2.6 BILLION. THOSE EARNINGS ARE PRINCIPALLY RELATED TO YAHOO JAPAN. IF THESE EARNINGS WERE TO BE REPATRIATED IN THE FUTURE, WE MAY BE SUBJECT TO ADDITIONAL U.S. INCOME TAXES (SUBJECT TO AN ADJUSTMENT\nFOR FOREIGN TAX CREDITS). IT IS NOT PRACTICABLE TO DETERMINE THE INCOME TAX LIABILITY THAT MIGHT BE INCURRED IF THESE EARNINGS WERE TO BE REPATRIATED.\nAS OF DECEMBER 31, 2013, OUR FEDERAL 2009 AND 2010 INCOME TAX RETURNS ARE CURRENTLY UNDER IRS EXAMINATION. FURTHERMORE, OUR CALIFORNIA 2005 THROUGH 2008 TAX RETURNS ARE ALSO UNDER VARIOUS STAGES OF\nAUDIT BY THE CALIFORNIA FRANCHISE TAX BOARD. WHILE THE CALIFORNIA FRANCHISE TAX BOARD HAS NOT REACHED ANY CONCLUSIONS ON THE 2007 AND 2008 RETURNS, WE HAVE PROTESTED THE PROPOSED CALIFORNIA FRANCHISE TAX BOARD\u0092S ADJUSTMENTS TO THE 2005 AND 2006\nRETURNS. WE ARE ALSO IN VARIOUS STAGES OF EXAMINATION AND APPEAL IN CONNECTION WITH OUR TAXES IN FOREIGN JURISDICTIONS, WHICH GENERALLY SPAN TAX YEARS 2005 THROUGH 2012.\nIT IS DIFFICULT TO PREDICT WHEN THESE EXAMINATIONS WILL BE SETTLED OR WHAT THEIR FINAL OUTCOMES WILL BE. WE BELIEVE THAT WE HAVE ADEQUATELY PROVIDED FOR ANY REASONABLY FORESEEABLE ADJUSTMENT AND THAT ANY\nSETTLEMENT WILL NOT HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL POSITION, RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, OR CASH FLOWS. OUR GROSS AMOUNT OF UNRECOGNIZED TAX BENEFITS AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2013 IS $695 MILLION, OF WHICH $606 MILLION IS\nRECORDED ON THE CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS.\nWE MAY HAVE ADDITIONAL TAX LIABILITIES IN CHINA RELATED TO THE SALE TO ALIBABA GROUP OF\n523 MILLION ALIBABA GROUP SHARES THAT TOOK PLACE DURING THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2012.

DURING THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2013, WE RECEIVED NET PROCEEDS OF $1.4 BILLION FROM THE ISSUANCE OF THE NOTES AND NET PROCEEDS OF $290 MILLION FROM THE SETTLEMENT OF DERIVATIVE HEDGE CONTRACTS. THIS WAS OFFSET BY THE\nREPURCHASE OF APPROXIMATELY 129 MILLION SHARES OF OUR OUTSTANDING COMMON STOCK FOR $3.3 BILLION DURING THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2013.\nAS OF DECEMBER 31, 2012, WE HAD CASH, CASH EQUIVALENTS, AND MARKETABLE SECURITIES TOTALING $6.0 BILLION, COMPARED TO $2.5 BILLION AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2011. THE INCREASE WAS DUE TO CASH PROCEEDS,\nNET OF FEES, OF $6.2 BILLION RECEIVED FROM THE SALE OF ALIBABA GROUP SHARES AND $550 MILLION FROM THE TIPLA PAYMENT. THIS WAS\n59\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nPARTIALLY OFFSET BY THE REPURCHASE OF APPROXIMATELY 126 MILLION SHARES OF OUR OUTSTANDING COMMON STOCK FOR $2.2 BILLION DURING THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2012 AND CASH TAXES PAID OF\n$2.3 BILLION IN 2012 RELATED TO THE SALE OF ALIBABA GROUP SHARES. AFTER THE PAYMENT OF TAXES AND FEES, NET CASH PROCEEDS FROM THE INITIAL REPURCHASE AND THE $550 MILLION TIPLA PAYMENT WERE APPROXIMATELY $4.3 BILLION.\nOUR FOREIGN SUBSIDIARIES HELD $593 MILLION OF OUR TOTAL $5 BILLION OF CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS AND MARKETABLE SECURITIES AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2013.\nDURING THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2012, WE RECORDED THE TAX EFFECT OF A ONE-TIME DISTRIBUTION OF EARNINGS FROM CERTAIN FOREIGN SUBSIDIARIES. WE MADE A ONE-TIME REPATRIATION OF FOREIGN EARNINGS AND RETURN OF BASIS OF FOREIGN SUBSIDIARIES\nOF $962 MILLION FROM CERTAIN OF OUR CONSOLIDATED FOREIGN SUBSIDIARIES IN 2012. THE CUMULATIVE EARNINGS REMAINING IN OUR CONSOLIDATED FOREIGN SUBSIDIARIES, IF REPATRIATED TO THE U.S., UNDER CURRENT LAW, WOULD BE SUBJECT TO THE U.S. INCOME TAXES WITH\nAN ADJUSTMENT FOR FOREIGN TAX CREDITS. FOR THE EARNINGS THAT ARE CONSIDERED INDEFINITELY REINVESTED OUTSIDE THE U.S, WE DO NOT ANTICIPATE A NEED TO REPATRIATE THESE EARNINGS FOR USE IN OUR U.S. OPERATIONS.\nON OCTOBER 19, 2012, WE ENTERED INTO A CREDIT AGREEMENT (THE \u0093CREDIT AGREEMENT\u0094) WITH CITIBANK, N.A., AS ADMINISTRATIVE AGENT, AND THE\nOTHER LENDERS PARTY THERETO FROM TIME TO TIME, WHICH WAS SCHEDULED TO MATURE ON OCTOBER 18, 2013. ON OCTOBER 10, 2013, WE ENTERED INTO AMENDMENT NO. 1 TO THE CREDIT AGREEMENT, WHICH EXTENDED THE TERMINATION DATE OF THE CREDIT\nAGREEMENT FROM OCTOBER 18, 2013 TO OCTOBER 9, 2014. DURING THE THREE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2013, WE BORROWED $150 MILLION UNDER THE CREDIT AGREEMENT AND SUBSEQUENTLY REPAID THE AMOUNT WITHIN THE SAME PERIOD. AS OF\nDECEMBER 31, 2013, WE WERE IN COMPLIANCE WITH THE FINANCIAL COVENANTS IN THE CREDIT AGREEMENT AND NO AMOUNTS WERE OUTSTANDING. SEE NOTE 10\u0097\u0093CREDIT AGREEMENT\u0094 IN THE NOTES TO OUR CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR\nADDITIONAL INFORMATION REGARDING OUR CREDIT AGREEMENT.\nWE INVEST EXCESS CASH PREDOMINANTLY IN MARKETABLE SECURITIES, MONEY MARKET FUNDS, AND\nTIME DEPOSITS THAT ARE LIQUID, HIGHLY RATED, AND THE MAJORITY OF WHICH HAVE EFFECTIVE MATURITIES OF LESS THAN ONE YEAR. OUR MARKETABLE SECURITIES ARE CLASSIFIED AS AVAILABLE-FOR-SALE AND ARE REPORTED AT FAIR VALUE, WITH UNREALIZED GAINS AND LOSSES,\nNET OF TAX, RECORDED IN ACCUMULATED OTHER COMPREHENSIVE INCOME. REALIZED GAINS OR LOSSES AND DECLINES IN VALUE JUDGED TO BE OTHER-THAN-TEMPORARY, IF ANY, ON AVAILABLE-FOR-SALE SECURITIES ARE REPORTED IN OTHER INCOME, NET. THE FAIR VALUE FOR\nSECURITIES IS DETERMINED BASED ON QUOTED MARKET PRICES OF THE HISTORICAL UNDERLYING SECURITY OR FROM READILY AVAILABLE PRICING SOURCES FOR THE IDENTICAL UNDERLYING SECURITIES THAT MAY NOT BE ACTIVELY TRADED AS OF THE VALUATION DATE. AS OF\nDECEMBER 31, 2013, CERTAIN OF OUR MARKETABLE SECURITIES HAD A FAIR VALUE BELOW COST DUE PRIMARILY TO THE CHANGES IN MARKET RATES OF INTEREST AND YIELDS ON THESE SECURITIES. WE EVALUATE THESE INVESTMENTS PERIODICALLY FOR POSSIBLE\nOTHER-THAN-TEMPORARY IMPAIRMENT. WE HAVE NO CURRENT REQUIREMENT OR INTENT TO SELL THESE SECURITIES. WE EXPECT TO RECOVER UP TO (OR BEYOND) THE INITIAL COST OF THE INVESTMENT.\nWE CURRENTLY HEDGE A PORTION OF OUR NET INVESTMENT IN YAHOO JAPAN WITH FORWARD CONTRACTS TO REDUCE THE RISK THAT OUR INVESTMENT IN YAHOO JAPAN WILL BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED BY FOREIGN CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATE\nFLUCTUATIONS. THE FORWARD CONTRACTS ARE REQUIRED TO BE SETTLED IN CASH AND THE AMOUNT OF CASH PAYMENT WE RECEIVE OR COULD BE REQUIRED TO PAY UPON SETTLEMENT COULD BE MATERIAL. IN 2013, WE RECEIVED $304 MILLION IN CASH SETTLEMENT OF CERTAIN FOREIGN\nEXCHANGE FORWARD CONTRACTS DESIGNATED AS NET INVESTMENT HEDGES REDUCING THE OUTSTANDING NOTIONAL AMOUNT TO $1.3 BILLION.\nWE EXPECT TO\nCONTINUE TO EVALUATE POSSIBLE ACQUISITIONS OF, OR STRATEGIC INVESTMENTS IN, BUSINESSES, PRODUCTS, AND TECHNOLOGIES THAT ARE COMPLEMENTARY TO OUR BUSINESS, WHICH ACQUISITIONS AND INVESTMENTS MAY REQUIRE THE USE OF CASH.\nWE EXPECT TO GENERATE POSITIVE CASH FLOWS FROM OPERATIONS IN 2014. WE USE CASH GENERATED BY OPERATIONS AS OUR PRIMARY SOURCE OF LIQUIDITY, SINCE WE\nBELIEVE THAT INTERNALLY GENERATED CASH FLOWS ARE SUFFICIENT TO SUPPORT OUR BUSINESS OPERATIONS AND CAPITAL EXPENDITURES. WE BELIEVE THAT EXISTING CASH, CASH EQUIVALENTS, AND INVESTMENTS IN MARKETABLE SECURITIES, TOGETHER WITH ANY CASH GENERATED FROM\nOPERATIONS, PROCEEDS FROM THE ISSUANCE OF THE NOTES, AND BORROWINGS UNDER THE CREDIT AGREEMENT, WILL BE SUFFICIENT TO MEET NORMAL OPERATING REQUIREMENTS INCLUDING CAPITAL EXPENDITURES FOR THE NEXT TWELVE MONTHS.\n60\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nSEE NOTE 2\u0097\u0093INVESTMENTS AND FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS\u0094 IN THE NOTES TO OUR CONSOLIDATED\nFINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR ADDITIONAL INFORMATION.\nCASH FLOW CHANGES\nCASH PROVIDED BY OPERATING ACTIVITIES IS DRIVEN BY OUR NET INCOME, ADJUSTED FOR NON-CASH ITEMS, WORKING CAPITAL CHANGES AND DIVIDENDS RECEIVED FROM EQUITY INVESTEES.

REPURCHASES UNDER THE REPURCHASE PROGRAMS MAY TAKE PLACE IN THE OPEN MARKET OR IN PRIVATELY NEGOTIATED TRANSACTIONS, INCLUDING DERIVATIVE TRANSACTIONS, AND MAY BE MADE UNDER A RULE 10B5-1 PLAN.\nDURING THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2013, WE REPURCHASED APPROXIMATELY 129 MILLION SHARES OF OUR COMMON STOCK UNDER THE MAY 2012 STOCK REPURCHASE PROGRAM AT AN AVERAGE PRICE OF $25.95 PER SHARE FOR A TOTAL OF APPROXIMATELY $3.3 BILLION.\nTHESE REPURCHASES INCLUDED THE REPURCHASE OF 40 MILLION SHARES OF OUR COMMON STOCK BENEFICIALLY OWNED BY THIRD POINT LLC ON JULY 25, 2013. THESE SHARES WERE REPURCHASED PURSUANT TO A PURCHASE AGREEMENT ENTERED INTO ON JULY 22, 2013,\nPRIOR TO THE MARKET OPENING FOR TRADING IN YAHOO STOCK, AT $29.11 PER SHARE, WHICH WAS THE CLOSING PRICE OF OUR COMMON STOCK ON JULY 19, 2013. THE TOTAL PURCHASE PRICE FOR THESE SHARES WAS $1.2 BILLION. THE REPURCHASE TRANSACTION WAS FUNDED\nPRIMARILY WITH CASH AS WELL AS BORROWINGS OF $150 MILLION UNDER OUR CREDIT AGREEMENT THAT HAVE BEEN REPAID.\n62\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nREPURCHASE CAPACITY UNDER APPROVED PROGRAMS\nJUNE 2010\nPROGRAM\nMAY 2012\nPROGRAM\nNOVEMBER 2013\nPROGRAM\nTOTAL\n(DOLLARS IN MILLIONS)\nJANUARY 1, 2011\n$2,224\n$\u0097\n$\u0097\n$2,224\nTOTAL 2011 REPURCHASES\n(1,619\n)\n\u0097\n\u0097\n(1,619\n)\nDECEMBER 31, 2011\n$605\n$\u0097\n$\u0097\n$605\nAUTHORIZED SHARE REPURCHASE AMOUNT UNDER MAY 2012 PROGRAM\n\u0097\n5,000\n\u0097\n5,000\nTOTAL 2012 REPURCHASES\n(605\n)\n(1,562\n)\n\u0097\n(2,167\n)\nDECEMBER 31, 2012\n$\u0097\n$3,438\n$\u0097\n$3,438\nAUTHORIZED SHARE REPURCHASE AMOUNT UNDER NOVEMBER 2013 PROGRAM\n\u0097\n\u0097\n5,000\n5,000\nTOTAL 2013 REPURCHASES\n\u0097\n(3,345\n)\n\u0097\n(3,345\n)\nDECEMBER 31, 2013\n$\u0097\n$93\n$5,000\n$5,093\nCAPITAL EXPENDITURES\nCAPITAL EXPENDITURES ARE GENERALLY COMPRISED OF PURCHASES OF COMPUTER HARDWARE, SOFTWARE, SERVER EQUIPMENT, FURNITURE AND FIXTURES, REAL ESTATE, AND CAPITALIZED SOFTWARE AND LABOR.\nCAPITAL EXPENDITURES, NET WERE $593 MILLION IN 2011, $506 MILLION IN 2012, AND $338 MILLION IN 2013.

WE HAVE THE OPTION TO RENEW THE LEASE FOR AN ADDITIONAL FIVE YEARS. THE LEASE REQUIRES MONTHLY PAYMENTS OF APPROXIMATELY $1 MILLION STARTING IN JULY 2015 THROUGH JUNE 2025; HOWEVER, RENT EXPENSE\nWILL BE RECORDED OVER THE LEASE TERM COMMENSURATE WITH THE RIGHT TO CONTROL THE SPACE WHICH BEGAN IN JULY 2013.\n(4)\nWE ARE OBLIGATED TO MAKE MINIMUM PAYMENTS UNDER CONTRACTS TO PROVIDE SPONSORED SEARCH AND\/OR DISPLAY ADVERTISING SERVICES TO OUR AFFILIATES, WHICH\nREPRESENT TAC.\n(5)\nWE ARE OBLIGATED TO MAKE PAYMENTS UNDER VARIOUS ARRANGEMENTS WITH VENDORS AND OTHER BUSINESS PARTNERS, PRINCIPALLY FOR MARKETING, BANDWIDTH, AND\nCONTENT ARRANGEMENTS.\n(6)\nWE ARE COMMITTED TO MAKE CERTAIN PAYMENTS UNDER VARIOUS INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY ARRANGEMENTS.\n(7)\nAS OF DECEMBER 31, 2013, UNRECOGNIZED TAX BENEFITS AND POTENTIAL INTEREST AND PENALTIES RESULTED IN ACCRUED LIABILITIES OF $675 MILLION,\nCLASSIFIED AS DEFERRED AND OTHER LONG-TERM TAX LIABILITIES, NET ON OUR CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS. AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2013, THE SETTLEMENT PERIOD FOR THE $675 MILLION INCOME TAX LIABILITIES CANNOT BE DETERMINED. SEE\nNOTE 16\u0097\u0093INCOME TAXES\u0094 IN THE NOTES TO OUR CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR ADDITIONAL INFORMATION.\nOTHER COMMITMENTS.\nIN THE ORDINARY COURSE OF BUSINESS, WE MAY PROVIDE INDEMNIFICATIONS OF VARYING SCOPE AND TERMS TO CUSTOMERS, VENDORS, LESSORS,\nJOINT VENTURES AND BUSINESS PARTNERS, PURCHASERS OF ASSETS OR SUBSIDIARIES AND OTHER PARTIES WITH RESPECT TO CERTAIN MATTERS, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, LOSSES ARISING OUT OF OUR BREACH OF AGREEMENTS OR REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES MADE BY US,\nSERVICES TO BE PROVIDED BY US, INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY INFRINGEMENT CLAIMS MADE BY THIRD PARTIES OR, WITH RESPECT TO THE SALE OF ASSETS OR A SUBSIDIARY, MATTERS RELATED TO OUR CONDUCT OF THE BUSINESS AND TAX MATTERS PRIOR TO THE SALE. IN\nADDITION, WE HAVE ENTERED INTO INDEMNIFICATION AGREEMENTS WITH OUR DIRECTORS AND CERTAIN OF OUR OFFICERS THAT WILL REQUIRE US, AMONG OTHER THINGS, TO INDEMNIFY THEM AGAINST CERTAIN LIABILITIES THAT MAY ARISE BY REASON OF THEIR STATUS OR SERVICE AS\nDIRECTORS OR OFFICERS. WE HAVE ALSO AGREED TO INDEMNIFY CERTAIN FORMER OFFICERS, DIRECTORS, AND EMPLOYEES OF ACQUIRED COMPANIES IN CONNECTION WITH THE ACQUISITION OF SUCH COMPANIES. WE MAINTAIN DIRECTOR AND OFFICER INSURANCE, WHICH MAY COVER CERTAIN\nLIABILITIES ARISING FROM OUR OBLIGATION TO INDEMNIFY OUR DIRECTORS AND OFFICERS, AND FORMER DIRECTORS AND OFFICERS OF ACQUIRED COMPANIES, IN CERTAIN CIRCUMSTANCES. IT IS NOT POSSIBLE TO DETERMINE THE AGGREGATE MAXIMUM POTENTIAL LOSS UNDER THESE\nINDEMNIFICATION AGREEMENTS DUE TO THE LIMITED HISTORY OF PRIOR INDEMNIFICATION CLAIMS AND THE UNIQUE FACTS AND CIRCUMSTANCES INVOLVED IN EACH PARTICULAR AGREEMENT. SUCH INDEMNIFICATION AGREEMENTS MIGHT NOT BE SUBJECT TO MAXIMUM LOSS CLAUSES.\nHISTORICALLY, WE HAVE NOT INCURRED MATERIAL COSTS AS A RESULT OF OBLIGATIONS UNDER THESE AGREEMENTS AND WE HAVE NOT ACCRUED ANY LIABILITIES RELATED TO SUCH INDEMNIFICATION OBLIGATIONS IN OUR CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.\nOFF BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS\nAS OF DECEMBER 31, 2013, WE DID NOT HAVE ANY RELATIONSHIPS WITH UNCONSOLIDATED ENTITIES OR FINANCIAL PARTNERSHIPS, SUCH AS ENTITIES OFTEN REFERRED TO\nAS STRUCTURED FINANCE OR SPECIAL PURPOSE ENTITIES, WHICH WOULD HAVE BEEN ESTABLISHED FOR THE PURPOSE OF FACILITATING OFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS OR OTHER CONTRACTUALLY NARROW OR LIMITED PURPOSES. ACCORDINGLY WE ARE NOT EXPOSED TO ANY FINANCING,\nLIQUIDITY, MARKET, OR CREDIT RISK THAT COULD ARISE IF WE HAD ENGAGED IN SUCH RELATIONSHIPS. IN ADDITION, WE IDENTIFIED NO VARIABLE INTERESTS CURRENTLY HELD IN ENTITIES FOR WHICH WE ARE THE PRIMARY BENEFICIARY. IN ADDITION, AS OF DECEMBER 31,\n2013, WE HAD NO OFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS THAT HAVE, OR ARE REASONABLY LIKELY TO HAVE, A CURRENT OR FUTURE MATERIAL EFFECT ON OUR CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL CONDITION, RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, LIQUIDITY, CAPITAL EXPENDITURES OR CAPITAL RESOURCES.\n64\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nCRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES\nOUR DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF OUR FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS IS BASED UPON OUR CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS, WHICH HAVE BEEN PREPARED IN ACCORDANCE WITH GAAP. THE PREPARATION OF\nTHESE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS REQUIRES US TO MAKE ESTIMATES, JUDGMENTS, AND ASSUMPTIONS THAT AFFECT THE REPORTED AMOUNTS OF ASSETS, LIABILITIES, REVENUE AND EXPENSES, AND THE RELATED DISCLOSURE OF CONTINGENT ASSETS AND LIABILITIES. WE BASE\nOUR ESTIMATES ON HISTORICAL EXPERIENCE AND ON VARIOUS OTHER ASSUMPTIONS THAT WE BELIEVE ARE REASONABLE UNDER THE CIRCUMSTANCES, THE RESULTS OF WHICH FORM THE BASIS FOR MAKING JUDGMENTS ABOUT, AMONG OTHER THINGS, THE CARRYING VALUES OF ASSETS AND\nLIABILITIES THAT ARE NOT READILY APPARENT FROM OTHER SOURCES. ACTUAL RESULTS MAY DIFFER FROM THESE ESTIMATES.\nAN ACCOUNTING POLICY IS\nCONSIDERED TO BE CRITICAL IF IT REQUIRES AN ACCOUNTING ESTIMATE TO BE MADE BASED ON ASSUMPTIONS ABOUT MATTERS THAT ARE HIGHLY UNCERTAIN AT THE TIME THE ESTIMATE IS MADE, AND IF DIFFERENT ESTIMATES THAT REASONABLY COULD HAVE BEEN USED, OR CHANGES IN\nTHE ACCOUNTING ESTIMATE THAT ARE REASONABLY LIKELY TO OCCUR, COULD MATERIALLY IMPACT THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS. WE BELIEVE THAT THE FOLLOWING CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES REFLECT THE MORE SIGNIFICANT ESTIMATES AND ASSUMPTIONS USED IN THE\nPREPARATION OF OUR CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.\nMANAGEMENT HAS DISCUSSED THE DEVELOPMENT AND SELECTION OF THESE CRITICAL ACCOUNTING\nESTIMATES WITH THE AUDIT AND FINANCE COMMITTEE (THE \u0093AUDIT COMMITTEE\u0094) OF OUR BOARD, AND THE AUDIT COMMITTEE HAS REVIEWED THE DISCLOSURE BELOW. IN ADDITION, THERE ARE OTHER ITEMS WITHIN OUR FINANCIAL STATEMENTS THAT REQUIRE ESTIMATION, BUT\nARE NOT DEEMED CRITICAL AS DEFINED ABOVE. CHANGES IN ESTIMATES USED IN THESE AND OTHER ITEMS COULD HAVE A MATERIAL IMPACT ON OUR CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.\nREVENUE RECOGNITION.\nOUR REVENUE IS GENERATED FROM DISPLAY AND SEARCH ADVERTISING, AND OTHER SOURCES. DISPLAY ADVERTISING REVENUE IS GENERATED FROM THE DISPLAY OF GRAPHICAL AND NON-GRAPHICAL\nADVERTISEMENTS AND SEARCH ADVERTISING REVENUE IS GENERATED FROM CLICKS ON TEXT-BASED LINKS TO ADVERTISERS\u0092 WEBSITES THAT APPEAR PRIMARILY ON SEARCH RESULTS PAGES, AND FROM REVENUE SHARING ARRANGEMENTS WITH PARTNERS FOR SEARCH TECHNOLOGY AND\nSERVICES. OTHER REVENUE CONSISTS OF LISTINGS-BASED SERVICES REVENUE, TRANSACTION REVENUE, AND FEES REVENUE. WHILE THE MAJORITY OF OUR REVENUE TRANSACTIONS CONTAIN STANDARD BUSINESS TERMS AND CONDITIONS, THERE ARE CERTAIN TRANSACTIONS THAT CONTAIN\nCONTRACT-SPECIFIC BUSINESS TERMS AND CONDITIONS. IN ADDITION, WE ENTER INTO CERTAIN SALES TRANSACTIONS THAT INVOLVE MULTIPLE ELEMENTS (ARRANGEMENTS WITH MORE THAN ONE DELIVERABLE). WE ALSO ENTER INTO ARRANGEMENTS TO PURCHASE GOODS AND\/OR SERVICES\nFROM CERTAIN CUSTOMERS. AS A RESULT, SIGNIFICANT CONTRACT INTERPRETATION IS SOMETIMES REQUIRED TO DETERMINE THE APPROPRIATE ACCOUNTING FOR THESE TRANSACTIONS INCLUDING: (1) WHETHER AN ARRANGEMENT EXISTS; (2) WHETHER FEES ARE FIXED OR\nDETERMINABLE; (3) HOW THE ARRANGEMENT CONSIDERATION SHOULD BE ALLOCATED AMONG POTENTIAL MULTIPLE ELEMENTS; (4) ESTABLISHING SELLING PRICES FOR DELIVERABLES CONSIDERING MULTIPLE FACTORS; (5) WHEN TO RECOGNIZE REVENUE ON THE\nDELIVERABLES; (6) WHETHER ALL ELEMENTS OF THE ARRANGEMENT HAVE BEEN DELIVERED; (7) WHETHER THE ARRANGEMENT SHOULD BE REPORTED GROSS AS A PRINCIPAL VERSUS NET AS AN AGENT; (8) WHETHER WE RECEIVE A SEPARATELY IDENTIFIABLE BENEFIT FROM\nTHE PURCHASE ARRANGEMENTS WITH CERTAIN CUSTOMERS FOR WHICH WE CAN REASONABLY ESTIMATE FAIR VALUE; AND (9) WHETHER THE CONSIDERATION RECEIVED FROM A VENDOR SHOULD BE CHARACTERIZED AS REVENUE OR A REIMBURSEMENT OF COSTS INCURRED. IN ADDITION, OUR\nREVENUE RECOGNITION POLICY REQUIRES AN ASSESSMENT AS TO WHETHER COLLECTION IS REASONABLY ASSURED, WHICH INHERENTLY REQUIRES US TO EVALUATE THE CREDITWORTHINESS OF OUR CUSTOMERS. CHANGES IN JUDGMENTS ON THESE ASSUMPTIONS AND ESTIMATES COULD\nMATERIALLY IMPACT THE TIMING OR AMOUNT OF REVENUE RECOGNITION.\nINCOME TAXES.\nSIGNIFICANT JUDGMENT IS REQUIRED IN EVALUATING OUR\nUNCERTAIN TAX POSITIONS AND DETERMINING OUR PROVISION FOR INCOME TAXES. SEE NOTE 16\u0097\u0093INCOME TAXES\u0094 IN THE NOTES TO OUR CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR ADDITIONAL INFORMATION. WE ESTABLISH LIABILITIES FOR TAX-RELATED\nUNCERTAINTIES BASED ON ESTIMATES OF WHETHER, AND THE EXTENT TO WHICH, ADDITIONAL TAXES WILL BE DUE. THESE LIABILITIES ARE ESTABLISHED WHEN WE BELIEVE THAT CERTAIN POSITIONS MIGHT BE CHALLENGED DESPITE OUR BELIEF THAT OUR TAX RETURN POSITIONS ARE IN\nACCORDANCE WITH APPLICABLE TAX LAWS. WE ADJUST THESE LIABILITIES IN LIGHT OF CHANGING FACTS AND CIRCUMSTANCES, SUCH AS THE CLOSING OF A TAX AUDIT, NEW TAX LEGISLATION, DEVELOPMENTS IN CASE LAW OR INTERACTIONS WITH THE TAX AUTHORITIES. TO THE EXTENT\n65\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nTHAT THE FINAL TAX OUTCOME OF THESE MATTERS IS DIFFERENT THAN THE AMOUNTS RECORDED, SUCH DIFFERENCES WILL AFFECT THE PROVISION FOR INCOME TAXES IN THE PERIOD IN WHICH SUCH DETERMINATION IS MADE.\nTHE PROVISION FOR INCOME TAXES INCLUDES THE EFFECT OF LIABILITY PROVISIONS AND CHANGES TO RESERVES THAT ARE CONSIDERED APPROPRIATE, AS WELL AS THE RELATED NET INTEREST AND PENALTIES.\nWE RECORD A VALUATION ALLOWANCE AGAINST CERTAIN OF OUR DEFERRED INCOME TAX ASSETS IF IT IS MORE LIKELY THAN NOT THAT THOSE ASSETS WILL NOT BE REALIZED. IN EVALUATING OUR ABILITY TO REALIZE OUR DEFERRED\nINCOME TAX ASSETS WE CONSIDER ALL AVAILABLE POSITIVE AND NEGATIVE EVIDENCE, INCLUDING OUR OPERATING RESULTS, ONGOING TAX PLANNING, AND FORECASTS OF FUTURE TAXABLE INCOME ON A JURISDICTION BY JURISDICTION BASIS. IN THE EVENT WE WERE TO DETERMINE THAT\nWE WOULD BE ABLE TO REALIZE THESE DEFERRED INCOME TAX ASSETS IN THE FUTURE, WE WOULD MAKE AN ADJUSTMENT TO THE VALUATION ALLOWANCE, WHICH WOULD REDUCE THE PROVISION FOR INCOME TAXES.\nGOODWILL.\nGOODWILL IS NOT AMORTIZED BUT IS EVALUATED FOR IMPAIRMENT ANNUALLY OR WHENEVER WE IDENTIFY CERTAIN TRIGGERING EVENTS OR CIRCUMSTANCES THAT WOULD MORE LIKELY THAN NOT REDUCE THE\nESTIMATED FAIR VALUE OF A REPORTING UNIT BELOW ITS CARRYING AMOUNT. EVENTS OR CIRCUMSTANCES THAT MIGHT INDICATE AN INTERIM EVALUATION IS WARRANTED INCLUDE, AMONG OTHER THINGS, UNEXPECTED ADVERSE BUSINESS CONDITIONS, REGULATORY CHANGES, LOSS OF KEY\nPERSONNEL AND REPORTING UNIT AND MACRO-ECONOMIC FACTORS. GOODWILL IS TESTED FOR IMPAIRMENT AT THE REPORTING UNIT LEVEL, WHICH IS ONE LEVEL BELOW OUR OPERATING SEGMENTS.\nWE IDENTIFIED U.S. & CANADA, LATIN AMERICA, AND TUMBLR AS THE REPORTING UNITS BELOW THE AMERICAS OPERATING SEGMENT; EUROPE AND MIDDLE EAST AS THE REPORTING UNITS BELOW THE EMEA OPERATING SEGMENT;\nAND TAIWAN, HONG KONG, AUSTRALIA & NEW ZEALAND, INDIA & SOUTH EAST ASIA AS THE REPORTING UNITS BELOW THE ASIA PACIFIC OPERATING SEGMENT. THESE OPERATING SEGMENTS ARE THE SAME AS OUR REPORTABLE SEGMENTS.\nWE TEST FOR GOODWILL IMPAIRMENT AS OF OCTOBER 31 EACH YEAR. TO TEST FOR IMPAIRMENT, WE FIRST USE A QUALITATIVE APPROACH TO DETERMINE WHETHER IT IS\nMORE LIKELY THAN NOT THE ESTIMATED FAIR VALUE OF A REPORTING UNIT IS LESS THAN ITS CARRYING AMOUNT. IF, AFTER COMPLETING THE QUALITATIVE ASSESSMENT WE DETERMINE THAT IT IS MORE LIKELY THAN NOT THAT THE ESTIMATED FAIR VALUE IS GREATER THAN THE\nCARRYING VALUE, THEN WE CONCLUDE THAT NO IMPAIRMENT EXISTS, AND THE TWO-STEP GOODWILL IMPAIRMENT TEST IS NOT REQUIRED. IF THE TWO-STEP QUANTITATIVE TEST IS REQUIRED, THE FIRST STEP OF THE QUANTITATIVE TEST INVOLVES COMPARING THE ESTIMATED FAIR VALUE\nOF OUR REPORTING UNITS TO THEIR CARRYING VALUES, INCLUDING GOODWILL. IF THE CARRYING VALUE OF THE REPORTING UNIT EXCEEDS ITS FAIR VALUE, THE SECOND STEP OF THE QUANTITATIVE TEST IS PERFORMED BY COMPARING THE CARRYING VALUE OF THE GOODWILL IN THE\nREPORTING UNIT TO ITS IMPLIED FAIR VALUE. AN IMPAIRMENT CHARGE IS RECOGNIZED FOR THE EXCESS OF THE CARRYING VALUE OF GOODWILL OVER ITS IMPLIED FAIR VALUE.\nIN 2013, FOR THE U.S. & CANADA, LATIN AMERICA, TUMBLR, TAIWAN, HONG KONG, AND AUSTRALIA & NEW ZEALAND REPORTING UNITS, WE PERFORMED THE QUALITATIVE ASSESSMENT. WE TOOK INTO CONSIDERATION\nEVENTS AND CIRCUMSTANCES THAT WOULD IMPACT THE FAIR VALUE OF THESE REPORTING UNITS, INCLUDING REPORTING UNIT, INDUSTRY, AND MACRO-ECONOMIC FACTORS. REPORTING UNIT FACTORS THAT WERE CONSIDERED INCLUDED THE RESULTS OF THE MOST RECENT IMPAIRMENT TEST,\nFINANCIAL PERFORMANCE IN THE CURRENT YEAR, AND CHANGES TO THE REPORTING UNIT\u0092S CARRYING VALUE. FOR INDUSTRY FACTORS, WE CONSIDERED GROWTH PROJECTIONS, MARKET SHARE, AND TRANSACTIONS WITHIN THE INDUSTRY. MACROECONOMIC FACTORS OVER THE PAST YEAR\nDID NOT NEGATIVELY IMPACT THE QUALITATIVE ASSESSMENT FOR THESE REPORTING UNITS. THEREFORE, BASED ON THE QUALITATIVE ASSESSMENT, WE CONCLUDED THE TWO-STEP IMPAIRMENT TEST WAS UNNECESSARY, AND NO GOODWILL IMPAIRMENT CHARGE WAS REQUIRED FOR 2013 FOR\nTHESE REPORTING UNITS.\nFOR 2013, A QUANTITATIVE ASSESSMENT WAS PERFORMED FOR EUROPE, INDIA & SOUTHEAST ASIA, AND MIDDLE EAST\nREPORTING UNITS. THE FAIR VALUES OF THESE REPORTING UNITS WERE ESTIMATED USING AN AVERAGE OF A MARKET APPROACH AND AN INCOME APPROACH AS THIS COMBINATION IS DEEMED TO BE THE MOST INDICATIVE OF OUR ESTIMATED FAIR VALUE IN AN ORDERLY TRANSACTION\nBETWEEN MARKET PARTICIPANTS AND IS CONSISTENT WITH THE METHODOLOGY USED FOR THE GOODWILL IMPAIRMENT TEST IN PRIOR YEARS. IN ADDITION, WE ENSURE THAT THE FAIR VALUES ESTIMATED UNDER THESE TWO APPROACHES ARE COMPARABLE WITH EACH OTHER. UNDER THE\nMARKET APPROACH, WE UTILIZE PUBLICLY-TRADED COMPARABLE COMPANY INFORMATION TO DETERMINE REVENUE AND EARNINGS MULTIPLES THAT ARE USED TO VALUE OUR REPORTING UNITS ADJUSTED FOR AN\n66\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nESTIMATED CONTROL PREMIUM. UNDER THE INCOME APPROACH, WE DETERMINE FAIR VALUE BASED ON ESTIMATED FUTURE CASH FLOWS OF EACH REPORTING UNIT DISCOUNTED BY AN ESTIMATED WEIGHTED-AVERAGE COST OF\nCAPITAL, REFLECTING THE OVERALL LEVEL OF INHERENT RISK OF A REPORTING UNIT AND THE RATE OF RETURN AN OUTSIDE INVESTOR WOULD EXPECT TO EARN. DETERMINING THE FAIR VALUE OF A REPORTING UNIT IS JUDGMENTAL IN NATURE AND REQUIRES THE USE OF SIGNIFICANT\nESTIMATES AND ASSUMPTIONS, INCLUDING SELECTION OF MARKET COMPARABLES, ESTIMATED FUTURE CASH FLOWS, AND DISCOUNT RATES.\nTHESE COMPONENTS ARE\nDISCUSSED BELOW.\n\u0095\nMARKET COMPARABLES\nWE SELECT COMPARABLE COMPANIES IN THE SPECIFIC REGIONS IN WHICH THESE REPORTING UNITS OPERATE BASED ON SIMILARITY OF TYPE OF BUSINESS, PRIMARILY THOSE INVOLVED IN ONLINE ADVERTISING, RELATIVE SIZE,\nFINANCIAL PROFILE, AND OTHER CHARACTERISTICS OF THOSE COMPANIES COMPARED TO THESE REPORTING UNITS. TRAILING AND FORWARD REVENUE AND EARNINGS MULTIPLES DERIVED FROM THESE COMPARABLE COMPANIES ARE APPLIED TO FINANCIAL METRICS OF THESE REPORTING UNITS\nTO DETERMINE THEIR ESTIMATED FAIR VALUES, ADJUSTED FOR AN ESTIMATED CONTROL PREMIUM.\n\u0095\nESTIMATED FUTURE CASH FLOWS\nWE BASE CASH FLOW PROJECTIONS FOR EACH REPORTING UNIT USING A FORECAST OF CASH FLOWS AND A TERMINAL VALUE BASED ON THE PERPETUITY GROWTH MODEL. THE FORECAST AND RELATED ASSUMPTIONS WERE DERIVED FROM THE\nMOST RECENT ANNUAL FINANCIAL FORECAST FOR WHICH THE PLANNING PROCESS COMMENCED IN OUR FOURTH QUARTER. KEY ASSUMPTIONS IN ESTIMATING FUTURE CASH FLOWS INCLUDE, AMONG OTHER ITEMS, REVENUE AND OPERATING EXPENSE GROWTH RATES, TERMINAL VALUE GROWTH RATE,\nAND CAPITAL EXPENDITURE AND WORKING CAPITAL LEVELS.\n\u0095\nDISCOUNT RATES\nWE EMPLOY A WEIGHTED AVERAGE COST OF CAPITAL (\u0093WACC\u0094) APPROACH TO DETERMINE THE DISCOUNT RATES USED IN OUR CASH FLOW PROJECTIONS. THE DETERMINATION OF THE DISCOUNT RATES FOR EACH REPORTING UNIT\nINCLUDES FACTORS SUCH AS THE RISK-FREE RATE OF RETURN AND THE RETURN AN OUTSIDE INVESTOR WOULD EXPECT TO EARN BASED ON THE OVERALL LEVEL OF INHERENT RISK. THE DETERMINATION OF EXPECTED RETURNS INCLUDES CONSIDERATION OF THE BETA (A MEASURE OF\nVOLATILITY) OF TRADED SECURITIES OF COMPARABLE COMPANIES AND RISK PREMIUMS OF REPORTING UNITS BASED ON INTERNATIONAL COST OF CAPITAL METHODS.\nTHE COMPONENTS ABOVE REQUIRE US TO MAKE ASSUMPTIONS ABOUT THE TIMING AND AMOUNT OF FUTURE CASH FLOWS, GROWTH RATES AND DISCOUNT RATES. SIGNIFICANT\nMANAGEMENT JUDGMENT IS INVOLVED IN DETERMINING THESE ESTIMATES AND ASSUMPTIONS, AND ACTUAL RESULTS MAY DIFFER FROM THOSE USED IN VALUATIONS. CHANGES IN THESE ESTIMATES AND ASSUMPTIONS COULD MATERIALLY AFFECT THE DETERMINATION OF FAIR VALUE FOR EACH\nREPORTING UNIT WHICH COULD TRIGGER FUTURE IMPAIRMENT. TO FACILITATE A BETTER UNDERSTANDING OF HOW THESE VALUATIONS ARE DETERMINED, A DISCUSSION OF OUR SIGNIFICANT ASSUMPTIONS IS PROVIDED BELOW.\nDISCOUNT RATE ASSUMPTIONS FOR THESE REPORTING UNITS TAKE INTO ACCOUNT OUR ASSESSMENT OF THE RISKS INHERENT IN THE FUTURE CASH FLOWS OF THE RESPECTIVE\nREPORTING UNIT AND OUR WEIGHTED-AVERAGE COST OF CAPITAL. WE ALSO REVIEW MARKETPLACE DATA TO ASSESS THE REASONABLENESS OF OUR COMPUTATION OF OUR OVERALL WEIGHTED AVERAGE COST OF CAPITAL AND, WHEN AVAILABLE, THE DISCOUNT RATES UTILIZED FOR EACH OF\nTHESE REPORTING UNITS.\nIN DETERMINING THE FAIR VALUE OF (1) THE EUROPE REPORTING UNIT, (2) THE INDIA & SOUTHEAST ASIA\nREPORTING UNIT, AND (3) THE MIDDLE EAST REPORTING UNIT, WE USED THE FOLLOWING ASSUMPTIONS.\n\u0095\nEXPECTED CASH FLOWS UNDERLYING OUR BUSINESS PLANS FOR THE PERIODS 2014 THROUGH 2024.\n\u0095\nCASH FLOWS BEYOND 2024 ARE PROJECTED TO GROW AT A PERPETUAL GROWTH RATE.\n\u0095\nIN ORDER TO RISK ADJUST THE CASH FLOW PROJECTIONS IN DETERMINING FAIR VALUE, WE UTILIZED DISCOUNT RATES OF APPROXIMATELY 11 PERCENT TO 15 PERCENT FOR\nEACH OF THESE REPORTING UNITS.\n67\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nBASED ON OUR QUANTITATIVE ASSESSMENT, WE DETERMINED THE ESTIMATED FAIR VALUE EXCEEDED THE CARRYING VALUE FOR\nTHE EUROPE REPORTING UNIT AND THE INDIA & SOUTHEAST ASIA REPORTING UNIT. THEREFORE, NO GOODWILL IMPAIRMENT CHARGE WAS REQUIRED FOR 2013.\nFOR THE QUANTITATIVE ANALYSIS PERFORMED FOR THE MIDDLE EAST REPORTING UNIT, THE CARRYING VALUE EXCEEDED THE ESTIMATED FAIR VALUE. THE SECOND STEP OF THE GOODWILL IMPAIRMENT TEST REQUIRED US TO FAIR VALUE\nALL ASSETS AND LIABILITIES OF OUR MIDDLE EAST REPORTING UNIT TO DETERMINE THE IMPLIED FAIR VALUE OF THIS REPORTING UNIT\u0092S GOODWILL. WE COMPARED THE IMPLIED FAIR VALUE OF THE REPORTING UNIT\u0092S GOODWILL TO ITS CARRYING VALUE. THIS TEST\nRESULTED IN A NON-CASH GOODWILL IMPAIRMENT CHARGE OF $64 MILLION FOR THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2013.\nSEE\nNOTE 5\u0097\u0093GOODWILL\u0094 IN THE NOTES TO OUR CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR ADDITIONAL INFORMATION.\nLONG-LIVED\nASSETS.\nWE AMORTIZE LONG-LIVED ASSETS OVER THEIR ESTIMATED USEFUL LIVES. IDENTIFIABLE LONG-LIVED ASSETS ARE REVIEWED FOR IMPAIRMENT WHENEVER EVENTS OR CHANGES IN CIRCUMSTANCES INDICATE THAT THE CARRYING VALUE MAY NOT BE RECOVERABLE.\nDETERMINATION OF RECOVERABILITY IS BASED ON THE LOWEST LEVEL OF IDENTIFIABLE ESTIMATED UNDISCOUNTED FUTURE CASH FLOWS RESULTING FROM USE OF THE ASSET AND ITS EVENTUAL DISPOSITION. MEASUREMENT OF ANY IMPAIRMENT LOSS IS BASED ON THE EXCESS OF THE\nCARRYING VALUE OF THE ASSET OVER ITS FAIR VALUE. FAIR VALUE IS DETERMINED BASED ON THE LOWEST LEVEL OF IDENTIFIABLE ESTIMATED FUTURE CASH FLOWS USING DISCOUNT RATES DETERMINED BY OUR MANAGEMENT TO BE COMMENSURATE WITH THE RISK INHERENT IN OUR\nBUSINESS MODEL. OUR ESTIMATES OF FUTURE CASH FLOWS ATTRIBUTABLE TO OUR LONG-LIVED ASSETS REQUIRE SIGNIFICANT JUDGMENT BASED ON OUR HISTORICAL AND ANTICIPATED RESULTS AND ARE SUBJECT TO MANY FACTORS. DIFFERENT ASSUMPTIONS AND JUDGMENTS COULD\nMATERIALLY AFFECT ESTIMATED FUTURE CASH FLOWS RELATING TO OUR LONG-LIVED ASSETS WHICH COULD TRIGGER IMPAIRMENT. NO IMPAIRMENTS OF LONG-LIVED ASSETS WERE IDENTIFIED DURING ANY OF THE PERIODS PRESENTED.\nINVESTMENTS IN EQUITY INTERESTS.\nWE ACCOUNT FOR INVESTMENTS IN THE COMMON STOCK OF ENTITIES IN WHICH WE HAVE THE ABILITY TO EXERCISE SIGNIFICANT\nINFLUENCE BUT DO NOT OWN A MAJORITY EQUITY INTEREST OR OTHERWISE CONTROL USING THE EQUITY METHOD. IN ACCOUNTING FOR THESE INVESTMENTS WE RECORD OUR PROPORTIONATE SHARE OF THE ENTITIES\u0092 NET INCOME OR LOSS, ONE QUARTER IN ARREARS.\nWE REVIEW OUR INVESTMENTS IN EQUITY INTERESTS FOR IMPAIRMENT WHENEVER EVENTS OR CHANGES IN BUSINESS CIRCUMSTANCES INDICATE THAT THE CARRYING VALUE OF THE\nINVESTMENT MAY NOT BE FULLY RECOVERABLE. INVESTMENTS IDENTIFIED AS HAVING AN INDICATION OF IMPAIRMENT ARE SUBJECT TO FURTHER ANALYSIS TO DETERMINE IF THE IMPAIRMENT IS OTHER-THAN-TEMPORARY AND THIS ANALYSIS REQUIRES ESTIMATING THE FAIR VALUE OF THE\nINVESTMENT. THE DETERMINATION OF FAIR VALUE OF THE INVESTMENT INVOLVES CONSIDERING FACTORS SUCH AS THE STOCK PRICES OF PUBLIC COMPANIES IN WHICH WE HAVE AN EQUITY INVESTMENT, CURRENT ECONOMIC AND MARKET CONDITIONS, THE OPERATING PERFORMANCE OF THE\nCOMPANIES, INCLUDING CURRENT EARNINGS TRENDS AND FORECASTED CASH FLOWS, AND OTHER COMPANY AND INDUSTRY SPECIFIC INFORMATION. THE FAIR VALUE DETERMINATION, PARTICULARLY FOR INVESTMENTS IN PRIVATELY-HELD COMPANIES, REQUIRES SIGNIFICANT JUDGMENT TO\nDETERMINE APPROPRIATE ESTIMATES AND ASSUMPTIONS. CHANGES IN THESE ESTIMATES AND ASSUMPTIONS COULD AFFECT THE CALCULATION OF THE FAIR VALUE OF THE INVESTMENTS AND THE DETERMINATION OF WHETHER ANY IDENTIFIED IMPAIRMENT IS OTHER-THAN-TEMPORARY.\nSTOCK-BASED COMPENSATION EXPENSE.\nWE RECOGNIZE STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION EXPENSE NET OF AN ESTIMATED FORFEITURE RATE AND THEREFORE ONLY\nRECOGNIZE COMPENSATION EXPENSE FOR THOSE SHARES EXPECTED TO VEST OVER THE SERVICE PERIOD OF THE AWARD. CALCULATING STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION EXPENSE REQUIRES THE INPUT OF HIGHLY SUBJECTIVE ASSUMPTIONS, INCLUDING THE EXPECTED TERM OF THE STOCK-BASED\nOPTIONS, STOCK PRICE VOLATILITY, AND THE PRE-VESTING AWARD FORFEITURE RATE. WE ESTIMATE THE EXPECTED LIFE OF OPTIONS GRANTED BASED ON HISTORICAL EXERCISE PATTERNS, WHICH WE BELIEVE ARE REPRESENTATIVE OF FUTURE BEHAVIOR. WE ESTIMATE THE VOLATILITY OF\nOUR COMMON STOCK ON THE DATE OF GRANT BASED ON THE IMPLIED VOLATILITY OF PUBLICLY TRADED OPTIONS ON OUR COMMON STOCK, WITH A TERM OF ONE YEAR OR GREATER. WE BELIEVE THAT IMPLIED VOLATILITY CALCULATED BASED ON ACTIVELY TRADED OPTIONS ON OUR COMMON\nSTOCK IS A BETTER INDICATOR OF EXPECTED VOLATILITY AND FUTURE STOCK PRICE TRENDS THAN HISTORICAL VOLATILITY.\n68\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nTHEREFORE, EXPECTED VOLATILITY FOR THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2013 WAS BASED ON A MARKET-BASED IMPLIED\nVOLATILITY. THE ASSUMPTIONS USED IN CALCULATING THE FAIR VALUE OF STOCK-BASED AWARDS REPRESENT OUR BEST ESTIMATES, BUT THESE ESTIMATES INVOLVE INHERENT UNCERTAINTIES AND THE APPLICATION OF MANAGEMENT JUDGMENT. AS A RESULT, IF FACTORS CHANGE AND WE\nUSE DIFFERENT ASSUMPTIONS, OUR STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION EXPENSE COULD BE MATERIALLY DIFFERENT IN THE FUTURE. IN ADDITION, WE ARE REQUIRED TO ESTIMATE THE EXPECTED PRE-VESTING AWARD FORFEITURE RATE, AS WELL AS THE PROBABILITY THAT PERFORMANCE\nCONDITIONS THAT AFFECT THE VESTING OF CERTAIN AWARDS WILL BE ACHIEVED, AND RECOGNIZE EXPENSE ONLY FOR THOSE SHARES EXPECTED TO VEST. PERFORMANCE CONDITIONS ARE ESTIMATED AND MONITORED THROUGHOUT THE YEAR. WE ESTIMATE THIS FORFEITURE RATE BASED ON\nHISTORICAL EXPERIENCE OF OUR STOCK-BASED AWARDS THAT ARE GRANTED AND CANCELLED BEFORE VESTING. IF OUR ACTUAL FORFEITURE RATE IS MATERIALLY DIFFERENT FROM OUR ORIGINAL ESTIMATES, THE STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION EXPENSE COULD BE SIGNIFICANTLY DIFFERENT\nFROM WHAT WE HAVE RECORDED IN THE CURRENT PERIOD. CHANGES IN THE ESTIMATED FORFEITURE RATE CAN HAVE A SIGNIFICANT EFFECT ON REPORTED STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION EXPENSE, AS THE EFFECT OF ADJUSTING THE FORFEITURE RATE FOR ALL CURRENT AND PREVIOUSLY\nRECOGNIZED EXPENSE FOR UNVESTED AWARDS IS RECOGNIZED IN THE PERIOD THE FORFEITURE ESTIMATE IS CHANGED. IF THE ACTUAL FORFEITURE RATE IS HIGHER THAN THE ESTIMATED FORFEITURE RATE, THEN AN ADJUSTMENT WILL BE MADE TO INCREASE THE ESTIMATED FORFEITURE\nRATE, WHICH WILL RESULT IN A DECREASE TO THE EXPENSE RECOGNIZED IN OUR CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS. IF THE ACTUAL FORFEITURE RATE IS LOWER THAN THE ESTIMATED FORFEITURE RATE, THEN AN ADJUSTMENT WILL BE MADE TO LOWER THE ESTIMATED FORFEITURE\nRATE, WHICH WILL RESULT IN AN INCREASE TO THE EXPENSE RECOGNIZED IN OUR CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.

OUR PRODUCTS AND SERVICES ARE THE BUILDING BLOCKS OF OUR OWN CLOUD SERVICES, OUR PARTNERS\u0092 CLOUD SERVICES AND OUR CUSTOMERS\u0092 CLOUD IT ENVIRONMENTS. AN\nIMPORTANT ELEMENT OF OUR CORPORATE STRATEGY IS TO DELIVER RELIABLE, SECURE AND SCALABLE PRODUCTS AND SERVICES THAT ARE BUILT UPON INDUSTRY STANDARDS AND ARE ENGINEERED TO WORK BOTH TOGETHER OR INDEPENDENTLY, REGARDLESS OF THE DEPLOYMENT MODEL\nSELECTED.\nWE BELIEVE THAT OUR INVESTMENTS IN, AND CONTINUED INNOVATION WITH RESPECT TO, OUR SOFTWARE AND CLOUD, HARDWARE, AND SERVICES\nBUSINESSES ARE THE FOUNDATION OF OUR LONG-TERM STRATEGIC PLANS. IN FISCAL 2014, 2013, AND 2012 WE INVESTED $5.2 BILLION, $4.9 BILLION AND $4.5 BILLION, RESPECTIVELY, IN RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT TO ENHANCE OUR EXISTING PORTFOLIO OF PRODUCTS AND\nSERVICES AND TO DEVELOP NEW PRODUCTS AND SERVICES. WE HAVE EXPANDED OUR ENTERPRISE-GRADE CLOUD COMPUTING OFFERINGS THROUGH OUR CONTINUED INVESTMENTS IN RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT AND THROUGH TARGETED ACQUISITIONS IN ORDER TO BROADEN OUR ORACLE CLOUD\nOFFERINGS. FOR EXAMPLE, OUR ORACLE CLOUD SOFTWARE-AS-A-SERVICE OFFERINGS, INCLUDING OUR SALES, MARKETING, CUSTOMER SERVICE, FINANCIALS, PROJECT MANAGEMENT, HUMAN CAPITAL AND TALENT MANAGEMENT CLOUD SOLUTIONS, AMONG OTHERS, ENABLE US TO PROVIDE IT\nFUNCTIONALITY THAT CUSTOMERS CAN USE TO MANAGE CRITICAL BUSINESS FUNCTIONS IN A RAPIDLY DEPLOYABLE DELIVERY MODEL WITH LOWER UPFRONT CUSTOMER INVESTMENT. CERTAIN OF OUR ENTERPRISE-GRADE CLOUD COMPUTING OFFERINGS INCLUDE INFRASTRUCTURE BASED UPON OUR\nORACLE ENGINEERED SYSTEMS, INCLUDING OUR ORACLE EXADATA DATABASE MACHINE, ORACLE EXALOGIC ELASTIC CLOUD AND ORACLE SUPERCLUSTER PRODUCTS, AMONG OTHERS. WE DESIGNED OUR ORACLE ENGINEERED SYSTEMS TO COMBINE CERTAIN OF OUR HARDWARE AND SOFTWARE\nOFFERINGS TO INCREASE COMPUTING PERFORMANCE RELATIVE TO OUR COMPETITORS\u0092 PRODUCTS, CREATING COST EFFICIENCIES, TIME SAVINGS AND OPERATIONAL COST ADVANTAGES FOR OUR CUSTOMERS. OUR ORACLE ENGINEERED SYSTEMS PROVIDE THE CORE INFRASTRUCTURE FOR OUR\nOWN ON-PREMISE IT DATA CENTERS AND THOSE OF OUR CUSTOMERS, AND FOR CLOUD IT ENVIRONMENTS, INCLUDING OUR OWN ORACLE CLOUD SERVICES, OUR PARTNERS\u0092 CLOUD SERVICES AND OUR CUSTOMERS\u0092 CLOUD ENVIRONMENTS. WE ALSO CONTINUE TO DEMONSTRATE OUR\nCOMMITMENT TO CUSTOMER CHOICE THROUGH ONGOING ENHANCEMENTS TO OUR ORACLE E-BUSINESS SUITE, SIEBEL, PEOPLESOFT AND JD EDWARDS APPLICATION SOFTWARE PRODUCTS AND SERVICES, AMONGST OTHERS.\nWE BELIEVE THAT AN ACTIVE ACQUISITION PROGRAM IS ANOTHER IMPORTANT ELEMENT OF OUR CORPORATE STRATEGY AS IT ENHANCES THE PRODUCTS AND SERVICES THAT WE CAN OFFER TO CUSTOMERS, EXPANDS OUR CUSTOMER BASE,\nPROVIDES GREATER SCALE TO ACCELERATE INNOVATION, GROWS OUR REVENUES AND EARNINGS AND INCREASES STOCKHOLDER VALUE. IN RECENT YEARS, WE HAVE INVESTED BILLIONS OF DOLLARS TO ACQUIRE A NUMBER OF COMPANIES, PRODUCTS, SERVICES AND TECHNOLOGIES THAT ADD\nTO, ARE COMPLEMENTARY TO, OR HAVE OTHERWISE ENHANCED OUR EXISTING OFFERINGS. WE EXPECT TO CONTINUE TO ACQUIRE COMPANIES, PRODUCTS, SERVICES AND TECHNOLOGIES TO FURTHER OUR CORPORATE STRATEGY.\n35\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nWE ARE ORGANIZED INTO THREE BUSINESSES\u0097SOFTWARE AND CLOUD, HARDWARE SYSTEMS AND SERVICES\u0097WHICH ARE\nFURTHER DIVIDED INTO CERTAIN OPERATING SEGMENTS. EACH OF OUR BUSINESSES AND OPERATING SEGMENTS HAS UNIQUE CHARACTERISTICS AND FACES DIFFERENT OPPORTUNITIES AND CHALLENGES. ALTHOUGH WE REPORT OUR ACTUAL RESULTS IN U.S. DOLLARS, WE CONDUCT A\nSIGNIFICANT NUMBER OF TRANSACTIONS IN CURRENCIES OTHER THAN U.S. DOLLARS. THEREFORE, WE PRESENT CONSTANT CURRENCY INFORMATION TO PROVIDE A FRAMEWORK FOR ASSESSING HOW OUR UNDERLYING BUSINESSES PERFORMED EXCLUDING THE EFFECTS OF FOREIGN CURRENCY RATE\nFLUCTUATIONS. OUR CLOUD INFRASTRUCTURE-AS-A-SERVICE SEGMENT WAS ESTABLISHED DURING OUR FISCAL QUARTER ENDED MAY 31, 2014. OUR FISCAL 2014 RESULTS, AND HISTORICAL RESULTS FOR FISCAL 2013 AND 2012, REFLECT THIS NEW SEGMENT STRUCTURE AND WILL\nCONTINUE PROSPECTIVELY IN OUR FUTURE FILINGS. SEE NOTE 16 OF NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS, INCLUDED ELSEWHERE IN THIS ANNUAL REPORT, FOR ADDITIONAL INFORMATION RELATED TO OUR OPERATING SEGMENTS. AN OVERVIEW OF OUR THREE BUSINESSES AND\nRELATED OPERATING SEGMENTS FOLLOWS.\nSOFTWARE AND CLOUD BUSINESS\nOUR SOFTWARE AND CLOUD BUSINESS, WHICH REPRESENTED 76%, 75% AND 72% OF OUR TOTAL REVENUES IN FISCAL 2014, 2013 AND 2012, RESPECTIVELY, IS COMPRISED OF THREE OPERATING SEGMENTS: (1) NEW SOFTWARE\nLICENSES AND CLOUD SOFTWARE SUBSCRIPTIONS, (2) CLOUD INFRASTRUCTURE-AS-A-SERVICE AND (3) SOFTWARE LICENSE UPDATES AND PRODUCT SUPPORT. ON A CONSTANT CURRENCY BASIS, WE EXPECT THAT OUR SOFTWARE AND CLOUD BUSINESS\u0092 TOTAL REVENUES\nGENERALLY WILL CONTINUE TO INCREASE DUE TO CONTINUED DEMAND FOR OUR SOFTWARE PRODUCTS AND SUBSCRIPTION OFFERINGS, OUR SOFTWARE LICENSE UPDATES AND PRODUCT SUPPORT OFFERINGS, INCLUDING THE HIGH PERCENTAGE OF CUSTOMERS THAT RENEW THEIR SOFTWARE\nLICENSE UPDATES AND PRODUCT SUPPORT CONTRACTS, AND OUR ACQUISITIONS, WHICH SHOULD ALLOW US TO GROW OUR PROFITS AND CONTINUE TO MAKE INVESTMENTS IN RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT.\nNEW SOFTWARE LICENSES AND CLOUD SOFTWARE SUBSCRIPTIONS.\nWE LICENSE OUR DATABASE AND MIDDLEWARE, AS WELL AS OUR APPLICATION SOFTWARE, AND PROVIDE ACCESS TO A BROAD\nRANGE OF OUR SOFTWARE THROUGH ORACLE CLOUD SOFTWARE-AS-A-SERVICE (SAAS) AND ORACLE CLOUD PLATFORM-AS-A-SERVICE (PAAS) OFFERINGS (SAAS AND PAAS COLLECTIVELY ARE REFERRED TO AS CLOUD SOFTWARE SUBSCRIPTIONS). OUR SOFTWARE OFFERINGS ARE SUBSTANTIALLY\nBUILT ON A STANDARDS-BASED, INTEGRATED ARCHITECTURE THAT IS DESIGNED TO HELP CUSTOMERS REDUCE THE COST AND COMPLEXITY OF THEIR IT INFRASTRUCTURE. OUR SOFTWARE OFFERINGS ARE SUBSTANTIALLY DESIGNED TO OPERATE ON BOTH SINGLE SERVER AND CLUSTERED SERVER\nCONFIGURATIONS FOR CLOUD OR ON-PREMISE IT ENVIRONMENTS, AND TO SUPPORT A CHOICE OF OPERATING SYSTEMS INCLUDING ORACLE SOLARIS, ORACLE LINUX, MICROSOFT WINDOWS AND THIRD PARTY UNIX PRODUCTS, AMONG OTHERS. OUR CUSTOMERS INCLUDE BUSINESSES OF MANY\nSIZES, GOVERNMENT AGENCIES, EDUCATIONAL INSTITUTIONS AND RESELLERS. WE MARKET AND SELL OUR SOFTWARE PRODUCTS AND SERVICES TO THESE CUSTOMERS WITH A SALES FORCE POSITIONED TO OFFER THE COMBINATIONS THAT BEST FIT THEIR NEEDS. WE ENABLE CUSTOMERS TO\nEVOLVE AND TRANSFORM TO SUBSTANTIALLY ANY IT ENVIRONMENT AT WHATEVER PACE IS MOST APPROPRIATE FOR THEM.\nTHE GROWTH IN OUR NEW SOFTWARE\nLICENSES AND OUR SAAS AND PAAS REVENUES THAT WE REPORT IS AFFECTED BY THE STRENGTH OF GENERAL ECONOMIC AND BUSINESS CONDITIONS, GOVERNMENTAL BUDGETARY CONSTRAINTS, THE COMPETITIVE POSITION OF OUR SOFTWARE OFFERINGS, OUR ACQUISITIONS AND FOREIGN\nCURRENCY FLUCTUATIONS. THE SUBSTANTIAL MAJORITY OF OUR NEW SOFTWARE LICENSES TRANSACTIONS ARE CHARACTERIZED BY LONG SALES CYCLES AND THE TIMING OF A FEW LARGE SOFTWARE LICENSE TRANSACTIONS CAN SUBSTANTIALLY AFFECT OUR QUARTERLY NEW SOFTWARE LICENSES\nREVENUES. NEW SOFTWARE LICENSES AND CLOUD SOFTWARE SUBSCRIPTIONS REVENUES REPRESENTED 28% OF OUR TOTAL REVENUES IN EACH OF FISCAL 2014 AND 2013 AND 27% IN FISCAL 2012. OUR CLOUD SOFTWARE SUBSCRIPTIONS CONTRACTS, WHICH CONSIST OF SAAS AND PAAS\nARRANGEMENTS, ARE GENERALLY ONE TO THREE YEARS IN DURATION AND WE STRIVE TO RENEW THESE CONTRACTS WHEN THEY ARE ELIGIBLE FOR RENEWAL. OUR NEW SOFTWARE LICENSES AND CLOUD SOFTWARE SUBSCRIPTIONS SEGMENT\u0092S MARGIN HAS HISTORICALLY TRENDED UPWARD\nOVER THE COURSE OF THE FOUR QUARTERS WITHIN A PARTICULAR FISCAL YEAR DUE TO THE HISTORICAL UPWARD TREND OF OUR NEW SOFTWARE LICENSES REVENUES OVER THOSE QUARTERLY PERIODS AND BECAUSE THE MAJORITY OF OUR COSTS FOR THIS SEGMENT ARE PREDOMINANTLY FIXED\nIN THE SHORT-TERM. HOWEVER, OUR NEW SOFTWARE LICENSES AND CLOUD SOFTWARE SUBSCRIPTIONS SEGMENT\u0092S MARGIN HAS BEEN AND WILL CONTINUE TO BE AFFECTED BY THE FAIR VALUE ADJUSTMENTS RELATING TO THE CLOUD SOFTWARE SUBSCRIPTIONS OBLIGATIONS THAT WE\nASSUMED IN OUR BUSINESS COMBINATIONS (DESCRIBED FURTHER BELOW) AND BY THE AMORTIZATION OF INTANGIBLE ASSETS ASSOCIATED WITH COMPANIES AND TECHNOLOGIES THAT WE HAVE ACQUIRED.\nFOR CERTAIN OF OUR ACQUIRED BUSINESSES, WE RECORDED ADJUSTMENTS TO REDUCE THE CLOUD SAAS AND PAAS OBLIGATIONS TO THEIR ESTIMATED FAIR VALUES AT THE ACQUISITION DATES. AS A RESULT, AS REQUIRED BY BUSINESS\nCOMBINATION ACCOUNTING RULES, WE DID NOT RECOGNIZE CLOUD SAAS AND PAAS REVENUES RELATED TO ACQUIRED CONTRACTS THAT WOULD HAVE BEEN OTHERWISE RECORDED BY THE ACQUIRED BUSINESSES AS INDEPENDENT ENTITIES IN THE AMOUNTS OF $17 MILLION, $45 MILLION\n36\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nAND $22 MILLION IN FISCAL 2014, 2013 AND 2012, RESPECTIVELY. TO THE EXTENT UNDERLYING CLOUD SAAS AND PAAS CONTRACTS ARE RENEWED WITH US FOLLOWING AN ACQUISITION, WE WILL RECOGNIZE THE REVENUES\nFOR THE FULL VALUES OF THESE CONTRACTS OVER THEIR RESPECTIVE CONTRACTUAL PERIODS.\nCLOUD\nINFRASTRUCTURE-AS-A-SERVICE.\nOUR CLOUD INFRASTRUCTURE-AS-A-SERVICE OFFERINGS (IAAS), WHICH REPRESENTED 1% OF OUR TOTAL REVENUES IN EACH OF FISCAL 2014 AND 2013 AND 2% IN FISCAL 2012, PROVIDE DEPLOYMENT AND MANAGEMENT\nOFFERINGS FOR OUR SOFTWARE AND HARDWARE AND RELATED IT INFRASTRUCTURE INCLUDING VIRTUAL MACHINE INSTANCES THAT ARE SUBSCRIPTION-BASED AND DESIGNED FOR COMPUTING AND RELIABLE AND SECURE OBJECT STORAGE; ORACLE ENGINEERED SYSTEMS HARDWARE AND RELATED\nSUPPORT THAT ARE DEPLOYED IN OUR CUSTOMERS\u0092 DATA CENTERS FOR A MONTHLY FEE; AND COMPREHENSIVE SOFTWARE AND HARDWARE MANAGEMENT AND MAINTENANCE SERVICES ARRANGEMENTS FOR CUSTOMER IT INFRASTRUCTURE FOR A STATED TERM THAT IS HOSTED AT OUR DATA\nCENTER FACILITIES, SELECT PARTNER DATA CENTERS OR PHYSICALLY ON-PREMISE AT CUSTOMER FACILITIES.\nSOFTWARE LICENSE UPDATES AND PRODUCT\nSUPPORT.\nCUSTOMERS THAT PURCHASE SOFTWARE LICENSE UPDATES AND PRODUCT SUPPORT ARE GRANTED RIGHTS TO UNSPECIFIED PRODUCT UPGRADES AND MAINTENANCE RELEASES AND PATCHES RELEASED DURING THE TERM OF THE SUPPORT PERIOD, AS\nWELL AS TECHNICAL SUPPORT ASSISTANCE. OUR SOFTWARE LICENSE UPDATES AND PRODUCT SUPPORT CONTRACTS ARE GENERALLY ONE YEAR IN DURATION AND SUBSTANTIALLY ALL OF OUR CUSTOMERS RENEW THEIR SOFTWARE LICENSE UPDATES AND PRODUCT SUPPORT CONTRACTS ANNUALLY.\nTHE GROWTH OF SOFTWARE LICENSE UPDATES AND PRODUCT SUPPORT REVENUES IS PRIMARILY INFLUENCED BY THREE FACTORS: (1) THE PERCENTAGE OF OUR SOFTWARE SUPPORT CONTRACT CUSTOMER BASE THAT RENEWS ITS SOFTWARE SUPPORT CONTRACTS, (2) THE AMOUNT OF\nNEW SOFTWARE SUPPORT CONTRACTS SOLD IN CONNECTION WITH THE SALE OF NEW SOFTWARE LICENSES AND (3) THE AMOUNT OF SOFTWARE SUPPORT CONTRACTS ASSUMED FROM COMPANIES WE HAVE ACQUIRED.\nSOFTWARE LICENSE UPDATES AND PRODUCT SUPPORT REVENUES, WHICH REPRESENTED 47%, 46% AND 43% OF OUR TOTAL REVENUES IN FISCAL 2014, 2013 AND 2012, RESPECTIVELY, IS OUR HIGHEST MARGIN BUSINESS UNIT. OUR\nSOFTWARE SUPPORT MARGINS DURING FISCAL 2014 WERE 89% AND ACCOUNTED FOR 77% OF OUR TOTAL MARGINS OVER THE SAME PERIOD. OUR SOFTWARE LICENSE UPDATES AND PRODUCT SUPPORT MARGINS HAVE BEEN AFFECTED BY FAIR VALUE ADJUSTMENTS RELATING TO SOFTWARE SUPPORT\nOBLIGATIONS ASSUMED IN BUSINESS COMBINATIONS (DESCRIBED FURTHER BELOW) AND BY AMORTIZATION OF INTANGIBLE ASSETS. HOWEVER, OVER THE LONGER TERM, WE BELIEVE THAT SOFTWARE LICENSE UPDATES AND PRODUCT SUPPORT REVENUES AND MARGINS WILL GROW FOR THE\nFOLLOWING REASONS.\n\u0095\nSUBSTANTIALLY ALL OF OUR CUSTOMERS, INCLUDING CUSTOMERS FROM ACQUIRED COMPANIES, RENEW THEIR SOFTWARE SUPPORT CONTRACTS WHEN ELIGIBLE FOR RENEWAL;\n\u0095\nSUBSTANTIALLY ALL OF OUR CUSTOMERS PURCHASE SOFTWARE LICENSE UPDATES AND PRODUCT SUPPORT CONTRACTS WHEN THEY BUY NEW SOFTWARE LICENSES, RESULTING IN A\nFURTHER INCREASE IN OUR SOFTWARE SUPPORT CONTRACT BASE. EVEN IF NEW SOFTWARE LICENSES REVENUES GROWTH WAS FLAT, SOFTWARE LICENSE UPDATES AND PRODUCT SUPPORT REVENUES WOULD CONTINUE TO GROW IN COMPARISON TO THE CORRESPONDING PRIOR YEAR PERIODS\nASSUMING CONTRACT RENEWAL AND CANCELLATION RATES AND FOREIGN CURRENCY RATES REMAINED RELATIVELY CONSTANT SINCE SUBSTANTIALLY ALL NEW SOFTWARE LICENSES TRANSACTIONS RESULT IN THE SALE OF SOFTWARE LICENSE UPDATES AND PRODUCT SUPPORT CONTRACTS, WHICH\nADD TO OUR SOFTWARE SUPPORT CONTRACT BASE; AND\n\u0095\nOUR ACQUISITIONS HAVE INCREASED OUR SOFTWARE SUPPORT CONTRACT BASE, AS WELL AS THE PORTFOLIO OF PRODUCTS AVAILABLE TO BE LICENSED AND SUPPORTED.\nWE RECORDED ADJUSTMENTS TO REDUCE SOFTWARE SUPPORT OBLIGATIONS ASSUMED IN BUSINESS COMBINATIONS TO THEIR ESTIMATED FAIR\nVALUES AT THE ACQUISITION DATES. AS A RESULT, AS REQUIRED BY BUSINESS COMBINATION ACCOUNTING RULES, WE DID NOT RECOGNIZE SOFTWARE LICENSE UPDATES AND PRODUCT SUPPORT REVENUES RELATED TO SOFTWARE SUPPORT CONTRACTS THAT WOULD HAVE BEEN OTHERWISE\nRECORDED BY THE ACQUIRED BUSINESSES AS INDEPENDENT ENTITIES IN THE AMOUNTS OF $3 MILLION, $14 MILLION AND $48 MILLION IN FISCAL 2014, 2013 AND 2012, RESPECTIVELY. TO THE EXTENT UNDERLYING SOFTWARE SUPPORT CONTRACTS ARE RENEWED WITH US FOLLOWING\nAN ACQUISITION, WE WILL RECOGNIZE THE REVENUES FOR THE FULL VALUES OF THE SOFTWARE SUPPORT CONTRACTS OVER THE RESPECTIVE SUPPORT PERIODS, THE MAJORITY OF WHICH ARE ONE YEAR.\nHARDWARE SYSTEMS BUSINESS\nOUR HARDWARE SYSTEMS BUSINESS IS COMPRISED OF TWO\nOPERATING SEGMENTS: (1) HARDWARE SYSTEMS PRODUCTS AND (2) HARDWARE SYSTEMS SUPPORT. OUR HARDWARE BUSINESS REPRESENTED 14% OF OUR TOTAL REVENUES IN EACH OF FISCAL 2014 AND 2013 AND 17% IN FISCAL 2012. WE EXPECT OUR HARDWARE BUSINESS TO HAVE\nLOWER OPERATING MARGINS AS A\n37\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nPERCENTAGE OF REVENUES THAN OUR SOFTWARE AND CLOUD BUSINESS DUE TO THE INCREMENTAL COSTS WE INCUR TO PRODUCE AND DISTRIBUTE THESE PRODUCTS AND TO PROVIDE SUPPORT SERVICES, INCLUDING DIRECT\nMATERIALS AND LABOR COSTS. WE EXPECT TO MAKE INVESTMENTS IN RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT TO IMPROVE EXISTING HARDWARE PRODUCTS AND SERVICES AND TO DEVELOP NEW HARDWARE PRODUCTS AND SERVICES.\nHARDWARE SYSTEMS PRODUCTS.\nWE PROVIDE A BROAD SELECTION OF HARDWARE SYSTEMS AND RELATED SERVICES INCLUDING SERVERS, STORAGE, NETWORKING, VIRTUALIZATION SOFTWARE,\nOPERATING SYSTEMS, AND MANAGEMENT SOFTWARE TO SUPPORT DIVERSE IT ENVIRONMENTS, INCLUDING CLOUD COMPUTING ENVIRONMENTS. WE ENGINEER OUR HARDWARE SYSTEMS WITH VIRTUALIZATION AND MANAGEMENT CAPABILITIES TO ENABLE THE RAPID DEPLOYMENT AND EFFICIENT\nMANAGEMENT OF CLOUD AND ON-PREMISE IT INFRASTRUCTURES. OUR HARDWARE PRODUCTS SUPPORT MANY OF THE WORLD\u0092S LARGEST CLOUD INFRASTRUCTURES, INCLUDING THE ORACLE CLOUD.\nOUR HARDWARE PRODUCTS AND SERVICES ARE DESIGNED TO WORK IN CUSTOMER ENVIRONMENTS THAT MAY INCLUDE OTHER ORACLE OR NON-ORACLE HARDWARE OR SOFTWARE COMPONENTS. THIS FLEXIBLE AND OPEN APPROACH PROVIDES\nORACLE\u0092S CUSTOMERS WITH A BROAD RANGE OF CHOICES IN DEPLOYING HARDWARE SYSTEMS, WHICH WE BELIEVE IS A PRIORITY FOR OUR CUSTOMERS. OUR HARDWARE PRODUCTS AND SERVICES ALSO HELP TO MEET CUSTOMERS\u0092 DEMANDS TO MANAGE GROWING AMOUNTS OF DATA AND\nBUSINESS REQUIREMENTS TO MEET INCREASING COMPLIANCE AND REGULATORY DEMANDS AND TO REDUCE ENERGY, SPACE AND OPERATIONAL COSTS. WE HAVE ALSO ENGINEERED OUR HARDWARE SYSTEMS PRODUCTS TO CREATE PERFORMANCE AND OPERATIONAL COST ADVANTAGES FOR CUSTOMERS\nWHEN OUR HARDWARE AND SOFTWARE PRODUCTS ARE COMBINED AS ORACLE ENGINEERED SYSTEMS.\nWE OFFER A WIDE RANGE OF SERVER SYSTEMS USING OUR SPARC\nMICROPROCESSOR. OUR SPARC SERVERS RUN THE ORACLE SOLARIS OPERATING SYSTEM AND ARE DESIGNED TO BE DIFFERENTIATED BY THEIR RELIABILITY, SECURITY, AND SCALABILITY. OUR MID-SIZE AND LARGE SERVERS ARE DESIGNED TO OFFER GREATER PERFORMANCE AND LOWER TOTAL\nCOST OF OWNERSHIP THAN MAINFRAME SYSTEMS FOR BUSINESS CRITICAL APPLICATIONS, FOR CUSTOMERS HAVING MORE COMPUTATIONALLY INTENSIVE NEEDS, AND AS PLATFORMS FOR BUILDING CLOUD COMPUTING IT ENVIRONMENTS. OUR SPARC SERVERS ARE ALSO A CORE COMPONENT OF THE\nORACLE SUPERCLUSTER, ONE OF OUR ORACLE ENGINEERED SYSTEMS.\nWE ALSO OFFER ENTERPRISE X86 SERVERS. THESE X86 SERVERS ARE BASED ON MICROPROCESSOR\nPLATFORMS FROM INTEL CORPORATION AND ARE COMPATIBLE WITH ORACLE SOLARIS, ORACLE LINUX, MICROSOFT WINDOWS AND OTHER OPERATING SYSTEMS. OUR X86 SERVERS ARE ALSO A CORE COMPONENT OF MANY OF OUR ORACLE ENGINEERED SYSTEMS INCLUDING ORACLE EXADATA\nDATABASE MACHINE, ORACLE EXALOGIC ELASTIC CLOUD, ORACLE EXALYTICS IN-MEMORY MACHINE AND THE ORACLE BIG DATA APPLIANCE.\nOUR STORAGE PRODUCTS\nARE DESIGNED TO SECURELY MANAGE, PROTECT, ARCHIVE AND RESTORE CUSTOMERS\u0092 MISSION CRITICAL DATA ASSETS AND CONSIST OF TAPE, DISK, FLASH AND HARDWARE-RELATED SOFTWARE INCLUDING FILE SYSTEMS SOFTWARE, BACK-UP AND ARCHIVE SOFTWARE AND STORAGE\nMANAGEMENT SOFTWARE AND NETWORKING FOR MAINFRAME AND OPEN SYSTEMS ENVIRONMENTS.\nOUR NETWORKING AND DATA CENTER FABRIC PRODUCTS, INCLUDING\nORACLE VIRTUAL NETWORKING, AND ORACLE INFINIBAND AND ETHERNET TECHNOLOGIES, ARE USED WITH OUR SERVER AND STORAGE PRODUCTS AND ARE INTEGRATED INTO OUR MANAGEMENT TOOLS TO HELP ENTERPRISE CUSTOMERS IMPROVE INFRASTRUCTURE PERFORMANCE, REDUCE COST AND\nCOMPLEXITY AND SIMPLIFY STORAGE AND SERVER CONNECTIVITY. WE ALSO OFFER HARDWARE AND SOFTWARE PRODUCTS AND SERVICES FOR COMMUNICATIONS NETWORKS INCLUDING NETWORK SIGNALING, POLICY CONTROL AND SUBSCRIBER DATA MANAGEMENT SOLUTIONS, AND SESSION BORDER\nCONTROL TECHNOLOGY, AMONGST OTHERS.\nTHE MAJORITY OF OUR HARDWARE SYSTEMS PRODUCTS ARE SOLD THROUGH INDIRECT CHANNELS, INCLUDING INDEPENDENT\nDISTRIBUTORS AND VALUE ADDED RESELLERS.\nTO PRODUCE OUR HARDWARE PRODUCTS, WE RELY ON BOTH OUR INTERNAL MANUFACTURING OPERATIONS AS WELL AS\nTHIRD PARTY MANUFACTURING PARTNERS. OUR INTERNAL MANUFACTURING OPERATIONS CONSIST PRIMARILY OF MATERIALS PROCUREMENT, ASSEMBLY, TESTING AND QUALITY CONTROL OF OUR ORACLE ENGINEERED SYSTEMS AND CERTAIN OF OUR ENTERPRISE AND DATA CENTER SERVERS AND\nSTORAGE SYSTEMS. FOR ALL OTHER MANUFACTURING, WE GENERALLY RELY ON THIRD PARTY MANUFACTURING PARTNERS TO PRODUCE OUR HARDWARE RELATED COMPONENTS AND HARDWARE PRODUCTS AND WE MAY INVOLVE OUR INTERNAL MANUFACTURING OPERATIONS IN THE FINAL ASSEMBLY,\nTESTING AND QUALITY CONTROL PROCESSES FOR THESE COMPONENTS AND PRODUCTS. WE DISTRIBUTE MOST OF OUR HARDWARE PRODUCTS EITHER FROM OUR FACILITIES OR PARTNER FACILITIES. WE STRIVE TO REDUCE COSTS BY SIMPLIFYING OUR MANUFACTURING PROCESSES THROUGH\nINCREASED STANDARDIZATION OF COMPONENTS ACROSS PRODUCT TYPES AND A \u0093BUILD-TO-ORDER\u0094 MANUFACTURING PROCESS IN WHICH PRODUCTS GENERALLY ARE BUILT ONLY AFTER CUSTOMERS HAVE PLACED FIRM ORDERS.\n38\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nOUR HARDWARE SYSTEMS PRODUCTS REVENUES, COST OF HARDWARE SYSTEMS PRODUCTS AND HARDWARE SYSTEMS OPERATING\nMARGINS THAT WE REPORT ARE AFFECTED BY OUR STRATEGY FOR AND THE COMPETITIVE POSITION OF OUR HARDWARE SYSTEMS PRODUCTS, THE STRENGTH OF GENERAL ECONOMIC AND BUSINESS CONDITIONS, GOVERNMENTAL BUDGETARY CONSTRAINTS, CERTAIN OF OUR ACQUISITIONS AND\nFOREIGN CURRENCY RATE FLUCTUATIONS. IN ADDITION, OUR OPERATING MARGINS FOR OUR HARDWARE SYSTEMS PRODUCTS SEGMENT HAVE BEEN AND WILL BE AFFECTED BY THE AMORTIZATION OF INTANGIBLE ASSETS.\nOUR QUARTERLY HARDWARE SYSTEMS PRODUCTS REVENUES ARE DIFFICULT TO PREDICT. THE TIMING OF CUSTOMER ORDERS AND DELAYS IN OUR ABILITY TO TIMELY MANUFACTURE OR DELIVER A FEW LARGE HARDWARE TRANSACTIONS COULD\nSUBSTANTIALLY AFFECT THE AMOUNT OF HARDWARE SYSTEMS PRODUCTS REVENUES, EXPENSES AND OPERATING MARGINS THAT WE REPORT.\nHARDWARE SYSTEMS\nSUPPORT.\nOUR HARDWARE SYSTEMS SUPPORT OFFERINGS PROVIDE CUSTOMERS WITH SOFTWARE UPDATES FOR SOFTWARE COMPONENTS THAT ARE ESSENTIAL TO THE FUNCTIONALITY OF OUR SERVER, STORAGE AND NETWORKING PRODUCTS, SUCH AS ORACLE\nSOLARIS AND CERTAIN OTHER SOFTWARE PRODUCTS, AND CAN INCLUDE PRODUCT REPAIRS, MAINTENANCE SERVICES AND TECHNICAL SUPPORT SERVICES. TYPICALLY, OUR HARDWARE SYSTEMS SUPPORT CONTRACT ARRANGEMENTS ARE INVOICED TO THE CUSTOMER AT THE BEGINNING OF THE\nSUPPORT PERIOD AND ARE ONE YEAR IN DURATION. WE CONTINUE TO EVOLVE HARDWARE SYSTEMS SUPPORT PROCESSES THAT ARE INTENDED TO PROACTIVELY IDENTIFY AND SOLVE QUALITY ISSUES AND TO INCREASE THE AMOUNT OF NEW AND RENEWED HARDWARE SYSTEMS SUPPORT CONTRACTS\nSOLD IN CONNECTION WITH THE SALES OF OUR HARDWARE SYSTEMS PRODUCTS. OUR HARDWARE SYSTEMS SUPPORT REVENUES THAT WE REPORT ARE INFLUENCED BY A NUMBER OF FACTORS, INCLUDING THE VOLUME OF PURCHASES OF HARDWARE PRODUCTS, THE MIX OF HARDWARE PRODUCTS\nPURCHASED, WHETHER CUSTOMERS DECIDE TO PURCHASE HARDWARE SYSTEMS SUPPORT CONTRACTS AT OR IN CLOSE PROXIMITY TO THE TIME OF HARDWARE PRODUCT SALE, THE PERCENTAGE OF OUR HARDWARE SYSTEMS SUPPORT CONTRACT CUSTOMER BASE THAT RENEWS ITS SUPPORT CONTRACTS\nAND OUR ACQUISITIONS. SUBSTANTIALLY ALL OF THESE FACTORS ARE HEAVILY INFLUENCED BY OUR CUSTOMERS\u0092 DECISIONS TO EITHER MAINTAIN OR UPGRADE THEIR EXISTING HARDWARE SYSTEMS\u0092 INFRASTRUCTURE TO NEWLY DEVELOPED TECHNOLOGIES THAT ARE AVAILABLE.\nOUR HARDWARE SYSTEMS SUPPORT MARGINS HAVE BEEN AND WILL BE AFFECTED BY CERTAIN OF OUR ACQUISITIONS AND RELATED ACCOUNTING, INCLUDING FAIR\nVALUE ADJUSTMENTS RELATING TO HARDWARE SYSTEMS SUPPORT OBLIGATIONS ASSUMED, AND BY THE AMORTIZATION OF INTANGIBLE ASSETS. AS REQUIRED BY BUSINESS COMBINATION ACCOUNTING RULES, WE RECORDED ADJUSTMENTS TO REDUCE OUR HARDWARE SYSTEMS SUPPORT REVENUES\nFOR CONTRACTS ASSUMED FROM OUR ACQUISITIONS TO THEIR ESTIMATED FAIR VALUES. THESE AMOUNTS WOULD HAVE BEEN RECORDED AS HARDWARE SYSTEMS SUPPORT REVENUES BY THE ACQUIRED BUSINESSES AS INDEPENDENT ENTITIES IN THE AMOUNTS OF $11 MILLION, $14 MILLION AND\n$30 MILLION FOR FISCAL 2014, 2013 AND 2012, RESPECTIVELY. TO THE EXTENT UNDERLYING HARDWARE SYSTEMS SUPPORT CONTRACTS ARE RENEWED WITH US FOLLOWING AN ACQUISITION, WE WILL RECOGNIZE THE REVENUES FOR THE FULL VALUES OF THE HARDWARE SYSTEMS SUPPORT\nCONTRACTS OVER THE RESPECTIVE SUPPORT PERIODS.\nSERVICES BUSINESS\nOUR SERVICES BUSINESS, WHICH REPRESENTED 10% OF OUR TOTAL REVENUES IN FISCAL 2014 AND 11% IN EACH OF FISCAL 2013 AND 2012, IS COMPRISED OF THE REMAINDER\nOF OUR OPERATING SEGMENTS. OUR SERVICES BUSINESS HAS LOWER MARGINS THAN OUR SOFTWARE AND CLOUD AND HARDWARE BUSINESSES. OUR SERVICES REVENUES ARE IMPACTED BY CERTAIN OF OUR ACQUISITIONS, GENERAL ECONOMIC CONDITIONS, GOVERNMENTAL BUDGETARY\nCONSTRAINTS, PERSONNEL REDUCTIONS IN OUR CUSTOMERS\u0092 IT DEPARTMENTS, TIGHTER CONTROLS OVER DISCRETIONARY SPENDING AND THE GROWTH IN OUR SOFTWARE AND HARDWARE SYSTEMS PRODUCTS REVENUES. OUR SERVICES BUSINESS\u0092 OFFERINGS INCLUDE.\n\u0095\nCONSULTING SERVICES THAT ARE DESIGNED TO HELP OUR CUSTOMERS AND GLOBAL SYSTEM INTEGRATOR PARTNERS MORE SUCCESSFULLY ARCHITECT AND DEPLOY OUR PRODUCTS\nINCLUDING IT STRATEGY ALIGNMENT, ENTERPRISE ARCHITECTURE PLANNING AND DESIGN, INITIAL PRODUCT IMPLEMENTATION AND INTEGRATION, AND ONGOING PRODUCT ENHANCEMENTS AND UPGRADES. WE UTILIZE A GLOBAL, BLENDED DELIVERY MODEL TO OPTIMIZE VALUE FOR OUR\nCUSTOMERS AND PARTNERS, CONSISTING OF ON-PREMISE CONSULTANTS FROM LOCAL GEOGRAPHIES, INDUSTRY SPECIALISTS AND CONSULTANTS FROM OUR GLOBAL DELIVERY AND SOLUTION CENTERS;\n\u0095\nADVANCED CUSTOMER SUPPORT SERVICES, WHICH ARE PROVIDED ON-PREMISE AND REMOTELY TO OUR CUSTOMERS TO ENABLE INCREASED PERFORMANCE AND HIGHER AVAILABILITY\nOF THEIR ORACLE PRODUCTS AND SERVICES; AND\n\u0095\nEDUCATION SERVICES FOR ORACLE PRODUCTS AND SERVICES, INCLUDING TRAINING AND CERTIFICATION PROGRAMS THAT ARE OFFERED TO CUSTOMERS, PARTNERS AND\nEMPLOYEES THROUGH A VARIETY OF FORMATS, INCLUDING INSTRUCTOR-LED CLASSES AT OUR EDUCATION CENTERS, LIVE VIRTUAL TRAINING, SELF-PACED ONLINE TRAINING, PRIVATE EVENTS AND CUSTOM TRAINING.\n39\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nACQUISITIONS\nAN ACTIVE ACQUISITION PROGRAM IS ANOTHER IMPORTANT ELEMENT OF OUR CORPORATE STRATEGY. IN RECENT YEARS, WE HAVE INVESTED BILLIONS OF DOLLARS TO ACQUIRE A NUMBER OF COMPLEMENTARY COMPANIES, PRODUCTS,\nSERVICES AND TECHNOLOGIES INCLUDING RESPONSYS, INC. (RESPONSYS) AND TEKELEC GLOBAL, INC. (TEKELEC) IN FISCAL 2014, AND ACME PACKET, INC. (ACME PACKET) IN FISCAL 2013, AMONGST OTHERS.\nON JUNE 22, 2014, WE ENTERED INTO AN AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER (MERGER AGREEMENT) WITH MICROS SYSTEMS, INC. (MICROS), A PROVIDER OF INTEGRATED SOFTWARE, HARDWARE AND SERVICES SOLUTIONS TO THE\nHOSPITALITY AND RETAIL INDUSTRIES. PURSUANT TO THE MERGER AGREEMENT, WE WILL COMMENCE A TENDER OFFER FOR THE OUTSTANDING SHARES AND SHARES GENERALLY REPRESENTING VESTED EQUITY INCENTIVE AWARDS OF MICROS (COLLECTIVELY, MICROS SHARES). MICROS\nSHAREHOLDERS WILL HAVE THE RIGHT TO TENDER THEIR MICROS SHARES TO ORACLE IN EXCHANGE FOR $68.00 PER SHARE IN CASH UPON CONSUMMATION OF THE TENDER OFFER. THE TENDER OFFER WILL COMMENCE NO LATER THAN TEN BUSINESS DAYS FROM JUNE 22, 2014. AFTER\nCOMPLETION OF THE TENDER OFFER AND SUBJECT TO CERTAIN LIMITED CONDITIONS, MICROS WILL MERGE WITH AND INTO A WHOLLY-OWNED SUBSIDIARY OF ORACLE. IN ADDITION, UNVESTED EQUITY AWARDS TO ACQUIRE MICROS COMMON STOCK THAT ARE OUTSTANDING IMMEDIATELY PRIOR\nTO THE CONCLUSION OF THE MERGER WILL GENERALLY BE CONVERTED INTO EQUITY AWARDS DENOMINATED IN SHARES OF OUR COMMON STOCK BASED ON FORMULAS CONTAINED IN THE MERGER AGREEMENT. THE ESTIMATED TOTAL PURCHASE PRICE FOR MICROS IS APPROXIMATELY\n$5.3 BILLION. THIS TRANSACTION IS CONDITIONED UPON (I) AT LEAST A MAJORITY OF THE MICROS SHARES BEING VALIDLY TENDERED TO ORACLE, (II) REGULATORY CLEARANCE UNDER THE HART-SCOTT-RODINO ANTITRUST IMPROVEMENTS ACT OF 1976,\n(III) THE APPLICABLE MERGER CONTROL LAWS OF THE EUROPEAN COMMISSION AND OTHER JURISDICTIONS, AND (IV) CERTAIN OTHER CUSTOMARY CLOSING CONDITIONS.\nWE BELIEVE OUR ACQUISITION PROGRAM STRENGTHENS OUR COMPETITIVE POSITION, ENHANCES THE PRODUCTS AND SERVICES THAT WE CAN OFFER TO CUSTOMERS, EXPANDS OUR CUSTOMER BASE, PROVIDES GREATER SCALE TO ACCELERATE\nINNOVATION, GROWS OUR REVENUES AND EARNINGS AND INCREASES STOCKHOLDER VALUE. WE EXPECT TO CONTINUE TO ACQUIRE COMPANIES, PRODUCTS, SERVICES AND TECHNOLOGIES IN FURTHERANCE OF OUR CORPORATE STRATEGY. NOTE 2 OF NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL\nSTATEMENTS INCLUDED ELSEWHERE IN THIS ANNUAL REPORT PROVIDES ADDITIONAL INFORMATION RELATED TO OUR PENDING AND RECENT ACQUISITIONS.\nWE BELIEVE\nWE CAN FUND OUR PENDING AND FUTURE ACQUISITIONS WITH OUR INTERNALLY AVAILABLE CASH, CASH EQUIVALENTS AND MARKETABLE SECURITIES, CASH GENERATED FROM OPERATIONS, ADDITIONAL BORROWINGS OR FROM THE ISSUANCE OF ADDITIONAL SECURITIES. WE ESTIMATE THE\nFINANCIAL IMPACT OF ANY POTENTIAL ACQUISITION WITH REGARD TO EARNINGS, OPERATING MARGIN, CASH FLOW AND RETURN ON INVESTED CAPITAL TARGETS BEFORE DECIDING TO MOVE FORWARD WITH AN ACQUISITION.\nCRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES\nOUR CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS ARE\nPREPARED IN ACCORDANCE WITH U.S. GENERALLY ACCEPTED ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES (GAAP) AS SET FORTH IN THE FINANCIAL ACCOUNTING STANDARDS BOARD\u0092S (FASB) ACCOUNTING STANDARDS CODIFICATION (ASC) AND CONSIDER THE VARIOUS STAFF ACCOUNTING BULLETINS AND\nOTHER APPLICABLE GUIDANCE ISSUED BY THE UNITED STATES SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION (SEC). GAAP, AS SET FORTH WITHIN THE ASC, REQUIRES US TO MAKE CERTAIN ESTIMATES, JUDGMENTS AND ASSUMPTIONS. WE BELIEVE THAT THE ESTIMATES, JUDGMENTS AND\nASSUMPTIONS UPON WHICH WE RELY ARE REASONABLE BASED UPON INFORMATION AVAILABLE TO US AT THE TIME THAT THESE ESTIMATES, JUDGMENTS AND ASSUMPTIONS ARE MADE. THESE ESTIMATES, JUDGMENTS AND ASSUMPTIONS CAN AFFECT THE REPORTED AMOUNTS OF ASSETS AND\nLIABILITIES AS OF THE DATE OF THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AS WELL AS THE REPORTED AMOUNTS OF REVENUES AND EXPENSES DURING THE PERIODS PRESENTED. TO THE EXTENT THERE ARE DIFFERENCES BETWEEN THESE ESTIMATES, JUDGMENTS OR ASSUMPTIONS AND ACTUAL RESULTS,\nOUR FINANCIAL STATEMENTS WILL BE AFFECTED. THE ACCOUNTING POLICIES THAT REFLECT OUR MORE SIGNIFICANT ESTIMATES, JUDGMENTS AND ASSUMPTIONS AND WHICH WE BELIEVE ARE THE MOST CRITICAL TO AID IN FULLY UNDERSTANDING AND EVALUATING OUR REPORTED FINANCIAL\nRESULTS INCLUDE THE FOLLOWING.\n\u0095\nREVENUE RECOGNITION\n\u0095\nBUSINESS COMBINATIONS\n\u0095\nGOODWILL AND INTANGIBLE ASSETS\u0097IMPAIRMENT ASSESSMENTS\n\u0095\nACCOUNTING FOR INCOME TAXES\n\u0095\nLEGAL AND OTHER CONTINGENCIES\n\u0095\nSTOCK-BASED COMPENSATION\n40\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nIN MANY CASES, THE ACCOUNTING TREATMENT OF A PARTICULAR TRANSACTION IS SPECIFICALLY DICTATED BY GAAP AND\nDOES NOT REQUIRE MANAGEMENT\u0092S JUDGMENT IN ITS APPLICATION. THERE ARE ALSO AREAS IN WHICH MANAGEMENT\u0092S JUDGMENT IN SELECTING AMONG AVAILABLE ALTERNATIVES WOULD NOT PRODUCE A MATERIALLY DIFFERENT RESULT. OUR SENIOR MANAGEMENT HAS REVIEWED\nOUR CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND RELATED DISCLOSURES WITH THE FINANCE AND AUDIT COMMITTEE OF THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS.\nREVENUE\nRECOGNITION\nOUR SOURCES OF REVENUES INCLUDE: (1) SOFTWARE AND CLOUD REVENUES, INCLUDING NEW SOFTWARE LICENSES REVENUES EARNED\nFROM GRANTING LICENSES TO USE OUR SOFTWARE PRODUCTS; CLOUD SAAS AND PAAS REVENUES GENERATED FROM FEES FOR GRANTING CUSTOMERS ACCESS TO A BROAD RANGE OF OUR SOFTWARE AND RELATED SUPPORT OFFERINGS ON A SUBSCRIPTION BASIS IN A SECURE, STANDARDS-BASED\nCLOUD COMPUTING ENVIRONMENT; CLOUD IAAS REVENUES GENERATED FROM FEES FOR DEPLOYMENT AND MANAGEMENT OFFERINGS FOR OUR SOFTWARE AND HARDWARE AND RELATED IT INFRASTRUCTURE GENERALLY ON A SUBSCRIPTION BASIS; AND SOFTWARE LICENSE UPDATES AND PRODUCT\nSUPPORT REVENUES; (2) HARDWARE SYSTEMS REVENUES, WHICH INCLUDE THE SALE OF HARDWARE SYSTEMS PRODUCTS INCLUDING COMPUTER SERVERS, STORAGE PRODUCTS, NETWORKING AND DATA CENTER FABRIC PRODUCTS, AND HARDWARE SYSTEMS SUPPORT REVENUES; AND\n(3) SERVICES, WHICH INCLUDES SOFTWARE AND HARDWARE RELATED SERVICES INCLUDING CONSULTING, ADVANCED CUSTOMER SUPPORT AND EDUCATION REVENUES. REVENUES GENERALLY ARE RECOGNIZED NET OF ANY TAXES COLLECTED FROM CUSTOMERS AND SUBSEQUENTLY REMITTED TO\nGOVERNMENTAL AUTHORITIES.\nREVENUE RECOGNITION FOR SOFTWARE PRODUCTS AND SOFTWARE RELATED SERVICES (SOFTWARE ELEMENTS)\nNEW SOFTWARE LICENSES REVENUES PRIMARILY REPRESENT FEES EARNED FROM GRANTING CUSTOMERS LICENSES TO USE OUR DATABASE, MIDDLEWARE AND APPLICATION SOFTWARE\nAND EXCLUDE CLOUD SAAS AND PAAS REVENUES AND REVENUES DERIVED FROM SOFTWARE LICENSE UPDATES, WHICH ARE INCLUDED IN SOFTWARE LICENSE UPDATES AND PRODUCT SUPPORT REVENUES. THE BASIS FOR OUR NEW SOFTWARE LICENSES REVENUE RECOGNITION IS SUBSTANTIALLY\nGOVERNED BY THE ACCOUNTING GUIDANCE CONTAINED IN ASC 985-605,\nSOFTWARE-REVENUE RECOGNITION.\nWE EXERCISE JUDGMENT AND USE ESTIMATES IN CONNECTION WITH THE DETERMINATION OF THE AMOUNT OF SOFTWARE AND SOFTWARE RELATED SERVICES REVENUES TO BE\nRECOGNIZED IN EACH ACCOUNTING PERIOD.\nFOR SOFTWARE LICENSE ARRANGEMENTS THAT DO NOT REQUIRE SIGNIFICANT MODIFICATION OR CUSTOMIZATION OF THE\nUNDERLYING SOFTWARE, WE RECOGNIZE NEW SOFTWARE LICENSES REVENUES WHEN: (1) WE ENTER INTO A LEGALLY BINDING ARRANGEMENT WITH A CUSTOMER FOR THE LICENSE OF SOFTWARE; (2) WE DELIVER THE PRODUCTS; (3) THE SALE PRICE IS FIXED OR\nDETERMINABLE AND FREE OF CONTINGENCIES OR SIGNIFICANT UNCERTAINTIES; AND (4) COLLECTION IS PROBABLE. REVENUES THAT ARE NOT RECOGNIZED AT THE TIME OF SALE BECAUSE THE FOREGOING CONDITIONS ARE NOT MET, ARE RECOGNIZED WHEN THOSE CONDITIONS ARE\nSUBSEQUENTLY MET.\nSUBSTANTIALLY ALL OF OUR SOFTWARE LICENSE ARRANGEMENTS DO NOT INCLUDE ACCEPTANCE PROVISIONS. HOWEVER, IF ACCEPTANCE\nPROVISIONS EXIST AS PART OF PUBLIC POLICY, FOR EXAMPLE, IN AGREEMENTS WITH GOVERNMENT ENTITIES WHERE ACCEPTANCE PERIODS ARE REQUIRED BY LAW, OR WITHIN PREVIOUSLY EXECUTED TERMS AND CONDITIONS THAT ARE REFERENCED IN THE CURRENT AGREEMENT AND ARE\nSHORT-TERM IN NATURE, WE GENERALLY RECOGNIZE REVENUES UPON DELIVERY PROVIDED THE ACCEPTANCE TERMS ARE PERFUNCTORY AND ALL OTHER REVENUE RECOGNITION CRITERIA HAVE BEEN MET. IF ACCEPTANCE PROVISIONS ARE NOT PERFUNCTORY (FOR EXAMPLE, ACCEPTANCE\nPROVISIONS THAT ARE LONG-TERM IN NATURE OR ARE NOT INCLUDED AS STANDARD TERMS OF AN ARRANGEMENT), REVENUES ARE RECOGNIZED UPON THE EARLIER OF RECEIPT OF WRITTEN CUSTOMER ACCEPTANCE OR EXPIRATION OF THE ACCEPTANCE PERIOD.\nTHE VAST MAJORITY OF OUR SOFTWARE LICENSE ARRANGEMENTS INCLUDE SOFTWARE LICENSE UPDATES AND PRODUCT SUPPORT CONTRACTS, WHICH ARE ENTERED INTO AT THE\nCUSTOMER\u0092S OPTION AND ARE RECOGNIZED RATABLY OVER THE TERM OF THE ARRANGEMENT, TYPICALLY ONE YEAR.

SUCH SOFTWARE RELATED MULTIPLE-ELEMENT ARRANGEMENTS INCLUDE THE SALE OF OUR SOFTWARE PRODUCTS, SOFTWARE LICENSE UPDATES AND PRODUCT SUPPORT CONTRACTS AND OTHER SOFTWARE RELATED SERVICES WHEREBY\nSOFTWARE LICENSE DELIVERY IS FOLLOWED BY THE SUBSEQUENT OR CONTEMPORANEOUS DELIVERY OF THE OTHER ELEMENTS. FOR THOSE SOFTWARE RELATED MULTIPLE-ELEMENT ARRANGEMENTS, WE HAVE APPLIED THE RESIDUAL METHOD TO\n41\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nDETERMINE THE AMOUNT OF NEW SOFTWARE LICENSE REVENUES TO BE RECOGNIZED PURSUANT TO ASC 985-605. UNDER THE RESIDUAL METHOD, IF FAIR VALUE EXISTS FOR UNDELIVERED ELEMENTS IN A MULTIPLE-ELEMENT\nARRANGEMENT, SUCH FAIR VALUE OF THE UNDELIVERED ELEMENTS IS DEFERRED WITH THE REMAINING PORTION OF THE ARRANGEMENT CONSIDERATION GENERALLY RECOGNIZED UPON DELIVERY OF THE SOFTWARE LICENSE. WE ALLOCATE THE FAIR VALUE OF EACH ELEMENT OF A SOFTWARE\nRELATED MULTIPLE-ELEMENT ARRANGEMENT BASED UPON ITS FAIR VALUE AS DETERMINED BY OUR VENDOR SPECIFIC OBJECTIVE EVIDENCE (VSOE\u0097DESCRIBED FURTHER BELOW), WITH ANY REMAINING AMOUNT ALLOCATED TO THE SOFTWARE LICENSE.\nREVENUE RECOGNITION FOR CLOUD SAAS, PAAS AND IAAS OFFERINGS, HARDWARE SYSTEMS PRODUCTS, HARDWARE SYSTEMS SUPPORT AND RELATED SERVICES (NONSOFTWARE\nELEMENTS)\nOUR REVENUE RECOGNITION POLICY FOR NONSOFTWARE DELIVERABLES INCLUDING CLOUD SAAS, PAAS AND IAAS OFFERINGS, HARDWARE SYSTEMS\nPRODUCTS AND HARDWARE SYSTEMS RELATED SERVICES IS BASED UPON THE ACCOUNTING GUIDANCE CONTAINED IN ASC 605-25,\nREVENUE RECOGNITION\n,\nMULTIPLE-ELEMENT ARRANGEMENTS,\nAND WE EXERCISE JUDGMENT AND USE ESTIMATES IN CONNECTION WITH THE\nDETERMINATION OF THE AMOUNT OF CLOUD SAAS, PAAS AND IAAS REVENUES, HARDWARE SYSTEMS PRODUCTS REVENUES AND HARDWARE RELATED SERVICES REVENUES TO BE RECOGNIZED IN EACH ACCOUNTING PERIOD.\nREVENUES FROM THE SALES OF OUR NONSOFTWARE ELEMENTS ARE RECOGNIZED WHEN: (1) PERSUASIVE EVIDENCE OF AN ARRANGEMENT EXISTS; (2) WE DELIVER THE PRODUCTS AND PASSAGE OF THE TITLE TO THE BUYER\nOCCURS; (3) THE SALE PRICE IS FIXED OR DETERMINABLE; AND (4) COLLECTION IS REASONABLY ASSURED. REVENUES THAT ARE NOT RECOGNIZED AT THE TIME OF SALE BECAUSE THE FOREGOING CONDITIONS ARE NOT MET ARE RECOGNIZED WHEN THOSE CONDITIONS ARE\nSUBSEQUENTLY MET. WHEN APPLICABLE, WE REDUCE REVENUES FOR ESTIMATED RETURNS OR CERTAIN OTHER INCENTIVE PROGRAMS WHERE WE HAVE THE ABILITY TO SUFFICIENTLY ESTIMATE THE EFFECTS OF THESE ITEMS. WHERE AN ARRANGEMENT IS SUBJECT TO ACCEPTANCE CRITERIA AND\nTHE ACCEPTANCE PROVISIONS ARE NOT PERFUNCTORY (FOR EXAMPLE, ACCEPTANCE PROVISIONS THAT ARE LONG-TERM IN NATURE OR ARE NOT INCLUDED AS STANDARD TERMS OF AN ARRANGEMENT), REVENUES ARE RECOGNIZED UPON THE EARLIER OF RECEIPT OF WRITTEN CUSTOMER\nACCEPTANCE OR EXPIRATION OF THE ACCEPTANCE PERIOD.\nOUR CLOUD SAAS AND PAAS OFFERINGS GENERALLY PROVIDE CUSTOMERS ACCESS TO CERTAIN OF OUR\nSOFTWARE WITHIN A CLOUD-BASED IT ENVIRONMENT THAT WE MANAGE AND OFFER TO CUSTOMERS ON A SUBSCRIPTION BASIS.

OUR CLOUD\nIAAS OFFERINGS ALSO INCLUDE OUR ORACLE ENGINEERED SYSTEMS HARDWARE AND RELATED SUPPORT THAT ARE DEPLOYED ON-PREMISE IN OUR CUSTOMERS\u0092 DATA CENTERS FOR A MONTHLY FEE AND PROVIDE FOR THE PURCHASE OF ADDITIONAL CAPACITY ON DEMAND. OUR REVENUE\nRECOGNITION POLICY FOR THESE ON-PREMISE OFFERINGS IS IN ACCORDANCE WITH ASC 605 AND ASC 840,\nLEASES\n, AND SUBSTANTIALLY ALL OF THESE OFFERINGS ARE ACCOUNTED FOR AS OPERATING LEASES AS OUR CONTRACTS ARE STRUCTURED SO THAT THE TERM OF THE\nARRANGEMENT IS LESS THAN 75% OF THE ECONOMIC LIFE OF THE EQUIPMENT AND THE PRESENT VALUE OF THE MINIMUM FIXED PAYMENTS ARE LESS THAN 90% OF THE FAIR MARKET VALUE OF THE EQUIPMENT AT THE INCEPTION OF THE ARRANGEMENT. OUR EVALUATION OF USEFUL LIFE IS\nBASED ON OUR HISTORICAL PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT CYCLES AND OUR HISTORICAL CUSTOMER HARDWARE UPGRADE CYCLES. CAPACITY ON DEMAND IS A CONTINGENT PAYMENT AND IS THEREFORE EXCLUDED FROM OUR ASSESSMENT OF THE NET PRESENT VALUE OF FIXED PAYMENTS. REVENUE FOR\nCAPACITY ON DEMAND IS RECOGNIZED IN THE PERIOD OUR CUSTOMERS ACCESS ADDITIONAL CAPACITY PROVIDED ALL OTHER REVENUE RECOGNITION CRITERIA HAVE BEEN MET.\nREVENUES FROM THE SALE OF HARDWARE SYSTEMS PRODUCTS REPRESENT AMOUNTS EARNED PRIMARILY FROM THE SALE OF COMPUTER SERVERS, STORAGE, AND NETWORKING PRODUCTS, INCLUDING THE SALES OF OUR ORACLE ENGINEERED\nSYSTEMS.\nOUR HARDWARE SYSTEMS SUPPORT OFFERINGS GENERALLY PROVIDE CUSTOMERS WITH SOFTWARE UPDATES FOR THE SOFTWARE COMPONENTS THAT ARE\nESSENTIAL TO THE FUNCTIONALITY OF OUR SERVER AND STORAGE PRODUCTS AND CAN ALSO INCLUDE PRODUCT REPAIRS, MAINTENANCE SERVICES AND TECHNICAL SUPPORT SERVICES. HARDWARE SYSTEMS SUPPORT CONTRACTS ARE GENERALLY PRICED AS A PERCENTAGE OF THE NET HARDWARE\nSYSTEMS PRODUCTS FEES. HARDWARE SYSTEMS SUPPORT CONTRACTS ARE ENTERED\n42\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nINTO AT THE CUSTOMER\u0092S OPTION AND ARE RECOGNIZED RATABLY OVER THE CONTRACTUAL TERM OF THE ARRANGEMENTS, WHICH ARE TYPICALLY ONE YEAR.\nREVENUE RECOGNITION FOR MULTIPLE-ELEMENT ARRANGEMENTS\u0097CLOUD SAAS, PAAS AND IAAS OFFERINGS, HARDWARE SYSTEMS PRODUCTS, HARDWARE SYSTEMS SUPPORT\nAND RELATED SERVICES (NONSOFTWARE ARRANGEMENTS)\nWE ENTER INTO ARRANGEMENTS WITH CUSTOMERS THAT PURCHASE BOTH NONSOFTWARE RELATED PRODUCTS\nAND SERVICES FROM US AT THE SAME TIME, OR WITHIN CLOSE PROXIMITY OF ONE ANOTHER (REFERRED TO AS NONSOFTWARE MULTIPLE-ELEMENT ARRANGEMENTS). EACH ELEMENT WITHIN A NONSOFTWARE MULTIPLE-ELEMENT ARRANGEMENT IS ACCOUNTED FOR AS A SEPARATE UNIT OF\nACCOUNTING PROVIDED THE FOLLOWING CRITERIA ARE MET: THE DELIVERED PRODUCTS OR SERVICES HAVE VALUE TO THE CUSTOMER ON A STANDALONE BASIS; AND FOR AN ARRANGEMENT THAT INCLUDES A GENERAL RIGHT OF RETURN RELATIVE TO THE DELIVERED PRODUCTS OR SERVICES,\nDELIVERY OR PERFORMANCE OF THE UNDELIVERED PRODUCT OR SERVICE IS CONSIDERED PROBABLE AND IS SUBSTANTIALLY CONTROLLED BY US. WE CONSIDER A DELIVERABLE TO HAVE STANDALONE VALUE IF THE PRODUCT OR SERVICE IS SOLD SEPARATELY BY US OR ANOTHER VENDOR OR\nCOULD BE RESOLD BY THE CUSTOMER. FURTHER, OUR REVENUE ARRANGEMENTS GENERALLY DO NOT INCLUDE A GENERAL RIGHT OF RETURN RELATIVE TO THE DELIVERED PRODUCTS. WHERE THE AFOREMENTIONED CRITERIA FOR A SEPARATE UNIT OF ACCOUNTING ARE NOT MET, THE\nDELIVERABLE IS COMBINED WITH THE UNDELIVERED ELEMENT(S) AND TREATED AS A SINGLE UNIT OF ACCOUNTING FOR THE PURPOSES OF ALLOCATION OF THE ARRANGEMENT CONSIDERATION AND REVENUE RECOGNITION. FOR THOSE UNITS OF ACCOUNTING THAT INCLUDE MORE THAN ONE\nDELIVERABLE BUT ARE TREATED AS A SINGLE UNIT OF ACCOUNTING, WE GENERALLY RECOGNIZE REVENUES OVER THE DELIVERY PERIOD OR IN THE CASE OF OUR CLOUD OFFERINGS, GENERALLY OVER THE ESTIMATED CUSTOMER RELATIONSHIP PERIOD. FOR THE PURPOSES OF REVENUE\nCLASSIFICATION OF THE ELEMENTS THAT ARE ACCOUNTED FOR AS A SINGLE UNIT OF ACCOUNTING, WE ALLOCATE REVENUE TO THE RESPECTIVE REVENUE LINE ITEMS WITHIN OUR CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF OPERATIONS BASED ON A RATIONAL AND CONSISTENT METHODOLOGY UTILIZING\nOUR BEST ESTIMATE OF RELATIVE SELLING PRICES OF SUCH ELEMENTS.\nFOR OUR NONSOFTWARE MULTIPLE-ELEMENT ARRANGEMENTS, WE ALLOCATE REVENUE TO EACH\nELEMENT BASED ON A SELLING PRICE HIERARCHY AT THE ARRANGEMENT\u0092S INCEPTION. THE SELLING PRICE FOR EACH ELEMENT IS BASED UPON THE FOLLOWING SELLING PRICE HIERARCHY: VSOE IF AVAILABLE, THIRD PARTY EVIDENCE (TPE) IF VSOE IS NOT AVAILABLE, OR\nESTIMATED SELLING PRICE (ESP) IF NEITHER VSOE NOR TPE ARE AVAILABLE (A DESCRIPTION AS TO HOW WE DETERMINE VSOE, TPE AND ESP IS PROVIDED BELOW). IF A TANGIBLE HARDWARE SYSTEMS PRODUCT INCLUDES SOFTWARE, WE DETERMINE WHETHER THE TANGIBLE HARDWARE\nSYSTEMS PRODUCT AND THE SOFTWARE WORK TOGETHER TO DELIVER THE PRODUCT\u0092S ESSENTIAL FUNCTIONALITY AND, IF SO, THE ENTIRE PRODUCT IS TREATED AS A NONSOFTWARE DELIVERABLE. THE TOTAL ARRANGEMENT CONSIDERATION IS ALLOCATED TO EACH SEPARATE UNIT OF\nACCOUNTING FOR EACH OF THE NONSOFTWARE DELIVERABLES USING THE RELATIVE SELLING PRICES OF EACH UNIT BASED ON THE AFOREMENTIONED SELLING PRICE HIERARCHY. WE LIMIT THE AMOUNT OF REVENUE RECOGNIZED FOR DELIVERED ELEMENTS TO AN AMOUNT THAT IS NOT\nCONTINGENT UPON FUTURE DELIVERY OF ADDITIONAL PRODUCTS OR SERVICES OR MEETING OF ANY SPECIFIED PERFORMANCE CONDITIONS.\nWHEN POSSIBLE, WE\nESTABLISH VSOE OF SELLING PRICE FOR DELIVERABLES IN SOFTWARE AND NONSOFTWARE MULTIPLE-ELEMENT ARRANGEMENTS USING THE PRICE CHARGED FOR A DELIVERABLE WHEN SOLD SEPARATELY AND FOR SOFTWARE LICENSE UPDATES AND PRODUCT SUPPORT AND HARDWARE SYSTEMS\nSUPPORT, BASED ON THE RENEWAL RATES OFFERED TO CUSTOMERS. TPE IS ESTABLISHED BY EVALUATING SIMILAR AND INTERCHANGEABLE COMPETITOR PRODUCTS OR SERVICES IN STANDALONE ARRANGEMENTS WITH SIMILARLY SITUATED CUSTOMERS. IF WE ARE UNABLE TO DETERMINE THE\nSELLING PRICE BECAUSE VSOE OR TPE DOES NOT EXIST, WE DETERMINE ESP FOR THE PURPOSES OF ALLOCATING THE ARRANGEMENT BY REVIEWING HISTORICAL TRANSACTIONS, INCLUDING TRANSACTIONS WHEREBY THE DELIVERABLE WAS SOLD ON A STANDALONE BASIS AND CONSIDERING\nSEVERAL OTHER EXTERNAL AND INTERNAL FACTORS INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, PRICING PRACTICES INCLUDING DISCOUNTING, MARGIN OBJECTIVES, COMPETITION, CONTRACTUALLY STATED PRICES, THE GEOGRAPHIES IN WHICH WE OFFER OUR PRODUCTS AND SERVICES, THE TYPE OF\nCUSTOMER (I.E., DISTRIBUTOR, VALUE ADDED RESELLER, GOVERNMENT AGENCY AND DIRECT END USER, AMONG OTHERS) AND THE STAGE OF THE PRODUCT LIFECYCLE. THE DETERMINATION OF ESP IS MADE THROUGH CONSULTATION WITH AND APPROVAL BY OUR MANAGEMENT, TAKING INTO\nCONSIDERATION OUR PRICING MODEL AND GO-TO-MARKET STRATEGY. AS OUR, OR OUR COMPETITORS\u0092, PRICING AND GO-TO-MARKET STRATEGIES EVOLVE, WE MAY MODIFY OUR PRICING PRACTICES IN THE FUTURE, WHICH COULD RESULT IN CHANGES TO OUR DETERMINATION OF VSOE,\nTPE AND ESP. AS A RESULT, OUR FUTURE REVENUE RECOGNITION FOR MULTIPLE-ELEMENT ARRANGEMENTS COULD DIFFER MATERIALLY FROM OUR RESULTS IN THE CURRENT PERIOD. SELLING PRICES ARE ANALYZED ON AN ANNUAL BASIS OR MORE FREQUENTLY IF WE EXPERIENCE SIGNIFICANT\nCHANGES IN OUR SELLING PRICES.\n43\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nREVENUE RECOGNITION POLICIES APPLICABLE TO BOTH SOFTWARE AND NONSOFTWARE ELEMENTS\nREVENUE RECOGNITION FOR MULTIPLE-ELEMENT ARRANGEMENTS\n\u0097\nARRANGEMENTS WITH SOFTWARE AND NONSOFTWARE ELEMENTS\nWE ALSO ENTER INTO MULTIPLE-ELEMENT ARRANGEMENTS THAT MAY INCLUDE A COMBINATION OF OUR VARIOUS SOFTWARE RELATED AND NONSOFTWARE RELATED PRODUCTS AND\nSERVICES OFFERINGS INCLUDING NEW SOFTWARE LICENSES, SOFTWARE LICENSE UPDATES AND PRODUCT SUPPORT, CLOUD SAAS, PAAS AND IAAS OFFERINGS, HARDWARE SYSTEMS PRODUCTS, HARDWARE SYSTEMS SUPPORT, CONSULTING, ADVANCED CUSTOMER SUPPORT SERVICES AND EDUCATION.\nIN SUCH ARRANGEMENTS, WE FIRST ALLOCATE THE TOTAL ARRANGEMENT CONSIDERATION BASED ON THE RELATIVE SELLING PRICES OF THE SOFTWARE GROUP OF ELEMENTS AS A WHOLE AND TO THE NONSOFTWARE ELEMENTS. WE THEN FURTHER ALLOCATE CONSIDERATION WITHIN THE SOFTWARE\nGROUP TO THE RESPECTIVE ELEMENTS WITHIN THAT GROUP FOLLOWING THE GUIDANCE IN ASC 985-605 AND OUR POLICIES AS DESCRIBED ABOVE. AFTER THE ARRANGEMENT CONSIDERATION HAS BEEN ALLOCATED TO THE ELEMENTS, WE ACCOUNT FOR EACH RESPECTIVE ELEMENT IN THE\nARRANGEMENT AS DESCRIBED ABOVE.\nOTHER REVENUE RECOGNITION POLICIES APPLICABLE TO SOFTWARE AND NONSOFTWARE ELEMENTS\nMANY OF OUR SOFTWARE ARRANGEMENTS INCLUDE CONSULTING IMPLEMENTATION SERVICES SOLD SEPARATELY UNDER CONSULTING ENGAGEMENT CONTRACTS AND ARE INCLUDED AS A\nPART OF OUR SERVICES BUSINESS. CONSULTING REVENUES FROM THESE ARRANGEMENTS ARE GENERALLY ACCOUNTED FOR SEPARATELY FROM NEW SOFTWARE LICENSES REVENUES BECAUSE THE ARRANGEMENTS QUALIFY AS SERVICES TRANSACTIONS AS DEFINED IN ASC 985-605. THE MORE\nSIGNIFICANT FACTORS CONSIDERED IN DETERMINING WHETHER THE REVENUES SHOULD BE ACCOUNTED FOR SEPARATELY INCLUDE THE NATURE OF SERVICES (I.E., CONSIDERATION OF WHETHER THE SERVICES ARE ESSENTIAL TO THE FUNCTIONALITY OF THE LICENSED PRODUCT), DEGREE OF\nRISK, AVAILABILITY OF SERVICES FROM OTHER VENDORS, TIMING OF PAYMENTS AND IMPACT OF MILESTONES OR ACCEPTANCE CRITERIA ON THE REALIZABILITY OF THE SOFTWARE LICENSE FEE. REVENUES FOR CONSULTING SERVICES ARE GENERALLY RECOGNIZED AS THE SERVICES ARE\nPERFORMED. IF THERE IS A SIGNIFICANT UNCERTAINTY ABOUT THE PROJECT COMPLETION OR RECEIPT OF PAYMENT FOR THE CONSULTING SERVICES, REVENUES ARE DEFERRED UNTIL THE UNCERTAINTY IS SUFFICIENTLY RESOLVED. WE ESTIMATE THE PROPORTIONAL PERFORMANCE ON\nCONTRACTS WITH FIXED OR \u0093NOT TO EXCEED\u0094 FEES ON A MONTHLY BASIS UTILIZING HOURS INCURRED TO DATE AS A PERCENTAGE OF TOTAL ESTIMATED HOURS TO COMPLETE THE PROJECT. IF WE DO NOT HAVE A SUFFICIENT BASIS TO MEASURE PROGRESS TOWARDS COMPLETION,\nREVENUES ARE RECOGNIZED WHEN WE RECEIVE FINAL ACCEPTANCE FROM THE CUSTOMER THAT THE SERVICES HAVE BEEN COMPLETED. WHEN TOTAL COST ESTIMATES EXCEED REVENUES, WE ACCRUE FOR THE ESTIMATED LOSSES IMMEDIATELY USING COST ESTIMATES THAT ARE BASED UPON AN\nAVERAGE FULLY BURDENED DAILY RATE APPLICABLE TO THE CONSULTING ORGANIZATION DELIVERING THE SERVICES. THE COMPLEXITY OF THE ESTIMATION PROCESS AND FACTORS RELATING TO THE ASSUMPTIONS, RISKS AND UNCERTAINTIES INHERENT WITH THE APPLICATION OF THE\nPROPORTIONAL PERFORMANCE METHOD OF ACCOUNTING AFFECTS THE AMOUNTS OF REVENUES AND RELATED EXPENSES REPORTED IN OUR CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS. A NUMBER OF INTERNAL AND EXTERNAL FACTORS CAN AFFECT OUR ESTIMATES, INCLUDING LABOR RATES,\nUTILIZATION AND EFFICIENCY VARIANCES AND SPECIFICATION AND TESTING REQUIREMENT CHANGES.\nOUR ADVANCED CUSTOMER SUPPORT SERVICES ARE OFFERED AS\nSTANDALONE ARRANGEMENTS OR AS A PART OF ARRANGEMENTS TO CUSTOMERS BUYING OTHER SOFTWARE AND NON-SOFTWARE PRODUCTS AND SERVICES. WE OFFER THESE ADVANCED SUPPORT SERVICES, BOTH ON-PREMISE AND REMOTE, TO ORACLE CUSTOMERS TO ENABLE INCREASED PERFORMANCE\nAND HIGHER AVAILABILITY OF THEIR PRODUCTS AND SERVICES. DEPENDING UPON THE NATURE OF THE ARRANGEMENT, REVENUES FROM THESE SERVICES ARE RECOGNIZED AS THE SERVICES ARE PERFORMED OR RATABLY OVER THE TERM OF THE SERVICE PERIOD, WHICH IS GENERALLY ONE\nYEAR OR LESS.\nEDUCATION REVENUES ARE ALSO A PART OF OUR SERVICES BUSINESS AND INCLUDE INSTRUCTOR-LED, MEDIA-BASED AND INTERNET-BASED TRAINING\nIN THE USE OF OUR SOFTWARE AND HARDWARE PRODUCTS. EDUCATION REVENUES ARE RECOGNIZED AS THE CLASSES OR OTHER EDUCATION OFFERINGS ARE DELIVERED.\nIF AN ARRANGEMENT CONTAINS MULTIPLE ELEMENTS AND DOES NOT QUALIFY FOR SEPARATE ACCOUNTING FOR THE PRODUCT AND SERVICE TRANSACTIONS, THEN NEW SOFTWARE\nLICENSES REVENUES AND\/OR HARDWARE SYSTEMS PRODUCTS REVENUES, INCLUDING THE COSTS OF HARDWARE SYSTEMS PRODUCTS, ARE GENERALLY RECOGNIZED TOGETHER WITH THE SERVICES BASED ON CONTRACT ACCOUNTING USING EITHER THE PERCENTAGE-OF-COMPLETION OR\nCOMPLETED-CONTRACT METHOD. CONTRACT ACCOUNTING IS APPLIED TO ANY BUNDLED SOFTWARE AND CLOUD, HARDWARE SYSTEMS AND SERVICES ARRANGEMENTS: (1) THAT INCLUDE MILESTONES OR CUSTOMER SPECIFIC ACCEPTANCE CRITERIA THAT MAY AFFECT COLLECTION OF THE\nSOFTWARE LICENSE OR HARDWARE SYSTEMS PRODUCT FEES; (2) WHERE CONSULTING SERVICES INCLUDE SIGNIFICANT MODIFICATION OR CUSTOMIZATION OF THE SOFTWARE OR HARDWARE SYSTEMS PRODUCT OR ARE OF A SPECIALIZED NATURE AND GENERALLY PERFORMED ONLY BY\nORACLE;\n44\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\n(3) WHERE SIGNIFICANT CONSULTING SERVICES ARE PROVIDED FOR IN THE SOFTWARE LICENSE CONTRACT OR HARDWARE SYSTEMS PRODUCT CONTRACT WITHOUT ADDITIONAL CHARGE OR ARE SUBSTANTIALLY DISCOUNTED; OR\n(4) WHERE THE SOFTWARE LICENSE OR HARDWARE SYSTEMS PRODUCT PAYMENT IS TIED TO THE PERFORMANCE OF CONSULTING SERVICES. FOR THE PURPOSES OF REVENUE CLASSIFICATION OF THE ELEMENTS THAT ARE ACCOUNTED FOR AS A SINGLE UNIT OF ACCOUNTING, WE ALLOCATE\nREVENUES TO SOFTWARE AND NONSOFTWARE ELEMENTS BASED ON A RATIONAL AND CONSISTENT METHODOLOGY UTILIZING OUR BEST ESTIMATE OF THE RELATIVE SELLING PRICE OF SUCH ELEMENTS.\nWE ALSO EVALUATE ARRANGEMENTS WITH GOVERNMENTAL ENTITIES CONTAINING \u0093FISCAL FUNDING\u0094 OR \u0093TERMINATION FOR CONVENIENCE\u0094 PROVISIONS, WHEN SUCH PROVISIONS ARE REQUIRED BY LAW, TO DETERMINE\nTHE PROBABILITY OF POSSIBLE CANCELLATION. WE CONSIDER MULTIPLE FACTORS, INCLUDING THE HISTORY WITH THE CUSTOMER IN SIMILAR TRANSACTIONS, THE \u0093ESSENTIAL USE\u0094 OF THE SOFTWARE OR HARDWARE SYSTEMS PRODUCTS AND THE PLANNING, BUDGETING AND\nAPPROVAL PROCESSES UNDERTAKEN BY THE GOVERNMENTAL ENTITY. IF WE DETERMINE UPON EXECUTION OF THESE ARRANGEMENTS THAT THE LIKELIHOOD OF CANCELLATION IS REMOTE, WE THEN RECOGNIZE REVENUES ONCE ALL OF THE CRITERIA DESCRIBED ABOVE HAVE BEEN MET. IF SUCH\nA DETERMINATION CANNOT BE MADE, REVENUES ARE RECOGNIZED UPON THE EARLIER OF CASH RECEIPT OR APPROVAL OF THE APPLICABLE FUNDING PROVISION BY THE GOVERNMENTAL ENTITY.\nWE ASSESS WHETHER FEES ARE FIXED OR DETERMINABLE AT THE TIME OF SALE AND RECOGNIZE REVENUES IF ALL OTHER REVENUE RECOGNITION REQUIREMENTS ARE MET. OUR STANDARD PAYMENT TERMS ARE NET 30 DAYS. HOWEVER,\nPAYMENT TERMS MAY VARY BASED ON THE COUNTRY IN WHICH THE AGREEMENT IS EXECUTED. PAYMENTS THAT ARE DUE WITHIN SIX MONTHS ARE GENERALLY DEEMED TO BE FIXED OR DETERMINABLE BASED ON OUR SUCCESSFUL COLLECTION HISTORY ON SUCH ARRANGEMENTS, AND THEREBY\nSATISFY THE REQUIRED CRITERIA FOR REVENUE RECOGNITION.\nWHILE MOST OF OUR ARRANGEMENTS FOR SALES WITHIN OUR BUSINESSES INCLUDE SHORT-TERM\nPAYMENT TERMS, WE HAVE A STANDARD PRACTICE OF PROVIDING LONG-TERM FINANCING TO CREDITWORTHY CUSTOMERS PRIMARILY THROUGH OUR FINANCING DIVISION. SINCE FISCAL 1989, WHEN OUR FINANCING DIVISION WAS FORMED, WE HAVE ESTABLISHED A HISTORY OF COLLECTION,\nWITHOUT CONCESSIONS, ON THESE RECEIVABLES WITH PAYMENT TERMS THAT GENERALLY EXTEND UP TO FIVE YEARS FROM THE CONTRACT DATE. PROVIDED ALL OTHER REVENUE RECOGNITION CRITERIA HAVE BEEN MET, WE RECOGNIZE NEW SOFTWARE LICENSES REVENUES AND HARDWARE\nSYSTEMS PRODUCTS REVENUES FOR THESE ARRANGEMENTS UPON DELIVERY, NET OF ANY PAYMENT DISCOUNTS FROM FINANCING TRANSACTIONS. WE HAVE GENERALLY SOLD RECEIVABLES FINANCED THROUGH OUR FINANCING DIVISION ON A NON-RECOURSE BASIS TO THIRD PARTY FINANCING\nINSTITUTIONS WITHIN 90 DAYS OF THE CONTRACTS\u0092 DATES OF EXECUTION AND WE CLASSIFY THE PROCEEDS FROM THESE SALES AS CASH FLOWS FROM OPERATING ACTIVITIES IN OUR CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF CASH FLOWS. WE ACCOUNT FOR THE SALES OF THESE RECEIVABLES\nAS \u0093TRUE SALES\u0094 AS DEFINED IN ASC 860,\nTRANSFERS AND SERVICING\n, AS WE ARE CONSIDERED TO HAVE SURRENDERED CONTROL OF THESE FINANCING RECEIVABLES.\nIN ADDITION, WE ENTER INTO ARRANGEMENTS WITH LEASING COMPANIES FOR THE SALE OF OUR HARDWARE SYSTEMS PRODUCTS. THESE LEASING COMPANIES, IN TURN, LEASE OUR PRODUCTS TO END-USERS. THE LEASING COMPANIES\nGENERALLY HAVE NO RECOURSE TO US IN THE EVENT OF DEFAULT BY THE END-USER AND WE RECOGNIZE REVENUE UPON DELIVERY, IF ALL OTHER REVENUE RECOGNITION CRITERIA HAVE BEEN MET.\nOUR CUSTOMERS INCLUDE SEVERAL OF OUR SUPPLIERS AND OCCASIONALLY, WE HAVE PURCHASED GOODS OR SERVICES FOR OUR OPERATIONS FROM THESE VENDORS AT OR ABOUT THE SAME TIME THAT WE HAVE SOLD OUR PRODUCTS TO THESE\nSAME COMPANIES (CONCURRENT TRANSACTIONS). SOFTWARE LICENSE AGREEMENTS OR SALES OF HARDWARE SYSTEMS THAT OCCUR WITHIN A THREE-MONTH TIME PERIOD FROM THE DATE WE HAVE PURCHASED GOODS OR SERVICES FROM THAT SAME CUSTOMER ARE REVIEWED FOR APPROPRIATE\nACCOUNTING TREATMENT AND DISCLOSURE. WHEN WE ACQUIRE GOODS OR SERVICES FROM A CUSTOMER, WE NEGOTIATE THE PURCHASE SEPARATELY FROM ANY SALES TRANSACTION, AT TERMS WE CONSIDER TO BE AT ARM\u0092S LENGTH AND SETTLE THE PURCHASE IN CASH. WE RECOGNIZE\nREVENUES FROM CONCURRENT TRANSACTIONS IF ALL OF OUR REVENUE RECOGNITION CRITERIA ARE MET AND THE GOODS AND SERVICES ACQUIRED ARE NECESSARY FOR OUR CURRENT OPERATIONS.\nBUSINESS COMBINATIONS\nWE APPLY THE PROVISIONS OF ASC 805,\nBUSINESS\nCOMBINATIONS\n, IN THE ACCOUNTING FOR OUR ACQUISITIONS. IT REQUIRES US TO RECOGNIZE SEPARATELY FROM GOODWILL THE ASSETS ACQUIRED AND THE LIABILITIES ASSUMED AT THEIR ACQUISITION DATE FAIR VALUES. GOODWILL AS OF THE ACQUISITION DATE IS MEASURED AS\nTHE EXCESS OF CONSIDERATION TRANSFERRED OVER THE NET OF THE ACQUISITION DATE FAIR VALUES OF THE ASSETS ACQUIRED AND THE LIABILITIES ASSUMED. WHILE WE USE OUR BEST ESTIMATES AND ASSUMPTIONS TO ACCURATELY VALUE ASSETS ACQUIRED AND LIABILITIES ASSUMED\nAT THE ACQUISITION DATE AS WELL AS CONTINGENT CONSIDERATION, WHERE APPLICABLE, OUR ESTIMATES ARE INHERENTLY UNCERTAIN AND SUBJECT TO REFINEMENT. AS A RESULT, DURING THE MEASUREMENT PERIOD, WHICH MAY BE UP TO ONE YEAR FROM THE ACQUISITION DATE, WE\nRECORD ADJUSTMENTS TO THE ASSETS\n45\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nACQUIRED AND LIABILITIES ASSUMED WITH THE CORRESPONDING OFFSET TO GOODWILL. UPON THE CONCLUSION OF THE MEASUREMENT PERIOD OR FINAL DETERMINATION OF THE VALUES OF ASSETS ACQUIRED OR LIABILITIES\nASSUMED, WHICHEVER COMES FIRST, ANY SUBSEQUENT ADJUSTMENTS ARE RECORDED TO OUR CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF OPERATIONS.\nACCOUNTING FOR BUSINESS\nCOMBINATIONS REQUIRES OUR MANAGEMENT TO MAKE SIGNIFICANT ESTIMATES AND ASSUMPTIONS, ESPECIALLY AT THE ACQUISITION DATE INCLUDING OUR ESTIMATES FOR INTANGIBLE ASSETS, CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS ASSUMED, RESTRUCTURING LIABILITIES, PRE-ACQUISITION\nCONTINGENCIES AND CONTINGENT CONSIDERATION, WHERE APPLICABLE. ALTHOUGH WE BELIEVE THE ASSUMPTIONS AND ESTIMATES WE HAVE MADE IN THE PAST HAVE BEEN REASONABLE AND APPROPRIATE, THEY ARE BASED IN PART ON HISTORICAL EXPERIENCE AND INFORMATION OBTAINED\nFROM THE MANAGEMENT OF THE ACQUIRED COMPANIES AND ARE INHERENTLY UNCERTAIN.\nEXAMPLES OF CRITICAL ESTIMATES IN VALUING CERTAIN OF THE\nINTANGIBLE ASSETS WE HAVE ACQUIRED INCLUDE BUT ARE NOT LIMITED TO.\n\u0095\nFUTURE EXPECTED CASH FLOWS FROM SOFTWARE LICENSE SALES, CLOUD SAAS AND PAAS CONTRACTS, HARDWARE SYSTEMS PRODUCT SALES, SUPPORT AGREEMENTS, CONSULTING\nCONTRACTS, OTHER CUSTOMER CONTRACTS, ACQUIRED DEVELOPED TECHNOLOGIES AND PATENTS;\n\u0095\nEXPECTED COSTS TO DEVELOP THE IN-PROCESS RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT INTO COMMERCIALLY VIABLE PRODUCTS AND ESTIMATED CASH FLOWS FROM THE PROJECTS WHEN\nCOMPLETED;\n\u0095\nTHE ACQUIRED COMPANY\u0092S BRAND AND COMPETITIVE POSITION, AS WELL AS ASSUMPTIONS ABOUT THE PERIOD OF TIME THE ACQUIRED BRAND WILL CONTINUE TO BE USED\nIN THE COMBINED COMPANY\u0092S PRODUCT PORTFOLIO; AND\n\u0095\nDISCOUNT RATES.\nUNANTICIPATED EVENTS AND CIRCUMSTANCES MAY OCCUR THAT MAY AFFECT THE ACCURACY OR VALIDITY OF SUCH ASSUMPTIONS, ESTIMATES OR ACTUAL RESULTS.\nWE ESTIMATE THE FAIR VALUES OF OUR CLOUD SAAS AND PAAS (COLLECTIVELY, CLOUD SOFTWARE SUBSCRIPTIONS), SOFTWARE LICENSE UPDATES AND PRODUCT SUPPORT, AND\nHARDWARE SYSTEMS SUPPORT OBLIGATIONS ASSUMED. THE ESTIMATED FAIR VALUES OF THESE PERFORMANCE OBLIGATIONS ARE DETERMINED UTILIZING A COST BUILD-UP APPROACH. THE COST BUILD-UP APPROACH DETERMINES FAIR VALUE BY ESTIMATING THE COSTS RELATED TO\nFULFILLING THE OBLIGATIONS PLUS A NORMAL PROFIT MARGIN. THE ESTIMATED COSTS TO FULFILL THE OBLIGATIONS ARE BASED ON THE HISTORICAL DIRECT COSTS RELATED TO PROVIDING THE SERVICES INCLUDING THE CORRECTION OF ANY ERRORS IN THE PRODUCTS ACQUIRED. THE\nSUM OF THESE COSTS AND OPERATING PROFIT APPROXIMATES, IN THEORY, THE AMOUNT THAT WE WOULD BE REQUIRED TO PAY A THIRD PARTY TO ASSUME THE PERFORMANCE OBLIGATIONS. WE DO NOT INCLUDE ANY COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH SELLING EFFORTS OR RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT\nOR THE RELATED FULFILLMENT MARGINS ON THESE COSTS. PROFIT ASSOCIATED WITH ANY SELLING EFFORTS IS EXCLUDED BECAUSE THE ACQUIRED ENTITIES WOULD HAVE CONCLUDED THOSE SELLING EFFORTS ON THE PERFORMANCE OBLIGATIONS PRIOR TO THE ACQUISITION DATE. WE ALSO\nDO NOT INCLUDE THE ESTIMATED RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT COSTS IN OUR FAIR VALUE DETERMINATIONS, AS THESE COSTS ARE NOT DEEMED TO REPRESENT A LEGAL OBLIGATION AT THE TIME OF ACQUISITION. AS A RESULT, WE DID NOT RECOGNIZE CLOUD SAAS AND PAAS REVENUES\nRELATED TO CLOUD SAAS AND PAAS CONTRACTS IN THE AMOUNTS OF $17 MILLION, $45 MILLION AND $22 MILLION THAT WOULD HAVE BEEN OTHERWISE RECORDED BY THE ACQUIRED BUSINESSES AS INDEPENDENT ENTITIES IN FISCAL 2014, 2013 AND 2012, RESPECTIVELY. WE DID NOT\nRECOGNIZE SOFTWARE LICENSE UPDATES AND PRODUCT SUPPORT REVENUES RELATED TO SUPPORT CONTRACTS IN THE AMOUNTS OF $3 MILLION, $14 MILLION AND $48 MILLION THAT WOULD HAVE BEEN OTHERWISE RECORDED BY THE ACQUIRED BUSINESSES AS INDEPENDENT ENTITIES IN\nFISCAL 2014, 2013 AND 2012, RESPECTIVELY. IN ADDITION, WE DID NOT RECOGNIZE HARDWARE SYSTEMS SUPPORT REVENUES RELATED TO HARDWARE SYSTEMS SUPPORT CONTRACTS THAT WOULD HAVE OTHERWISE BEEN RECORDED BY THE ACQUIRED BUSINESSES AS INDEPENDENT ENTITIES IN\nTHE AMOUNTS OF $11 MILLION, $14 MILLION AND $30 MILLION FOR FISCAL 2014, 2013 AND 2012, RESPECTIVELY. HISTORICALLY, SUBSTANTIALLY ALL OF OUR CUSTOMERS, INCLUDING CUSTOMERS FROM ACQUIRED COMPANIES, RENEW THEIR SOFTWARE LICENSE UPDATES AND PRODUCT\nSUPPORT CONTRACTS WHEN THE CONTRACTS ARE ELIGIBLE FOR RENEWAL AND WE STRIVE TO RENEW CLOUD SAAS AND PAAS AND HARDWARE SYSTEMS SUPPORT CONTRACTS. TO THE EXTENT CLOUD SAAS AND PAAS, SOFTWARE SUPPORT OR HARDWARE SYSTEMS SUPPORT CONTRACTS ARE RENEWED,\nWE WILL RECOGNIZE THE REVENUES FOR THE FULL VALUES OF THE CONTRACTS OVER THE CONTRACTS\u0092 PERIODS, WHICH ARE GENERALLY ONE YEAR IN DURATION.\nIN CONNECTION WITH A BUSINESS COMBINATION OR OTHER STRATEGIC INITIATIVE, WE MAY ESTIMATE COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH RESTRUCTURING PLANS COMMITTED TO BY OUR\nMANAGEMENT. RESTRUCTURING COSTS ARE TYPICALLY COMPRISED OF EMPLOYEE SEVERANCE COSTS, COSTS OF CONSOLIDATING DUPLICATE FACILITIES AND CONTRACT TERMINATION COSTS. RESTRUCTURING EXPENSES ARE BASED UPON PLANS THAT HAVE BEEN COMMITTED TO BY OUR\nMANAGEMENT, BUT MAY BE REFINED IN SUBSEQUENT PERIODS.\n46\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nWE ACCOUNT FOR COSTS TO EXIT OR RESTRUCTURE CERTAIN ACTIVITIES OF AN ACQUIRED COMPANY SEPARATELY FROM THE BUSINESS COMBINATION PURSUANT TO ASC 420,\nEXIT OR DISPOSAL COST OBLIGATIONS.\nA\nLIABILITY FOR COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH AN EXIT OR DISPOSAL ACTIVITY IS RECOGNIZED AND MEASURED AT ITS FAIR VALUE IN OUR CONSOLIDATED STATEMENT OF OPERATIONS IN THE PERIOD IN WHICH THE LIABILITY IS INCURRED. WHEN ESTIMATING THE FAIR VALUE OF FACILITY\nRESTRUCTURING ACTIVITIES, ASSUMPTIONS ARE APPLIED REGARDING ESTIMATED SUB-LEASE PAYMENTS TO BE RECEIVED, WHICH CAN DIFFER MATERIALLY FROM ACTUAL RESULTS. THIS MAY REQUIRE US TO REVISE OUR INITIAL ESTIMATES WHICH MAY MATERIALLY AFFECT OUR RESULTS OF\nOPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL POSITION IN THE PERIOD THE REVISION IS MADE.\nFOR A GIVEN ACQUISITION, WE MAY IDENTIFY CERTAIN PRE-ACQUISITION\nCONTINGENCIES AS OF THE ACQUISITION DATE AND MAY EXTEND OUR REVIEW AND EVALUATION OF THESE PRE-ACQUISITION CONTINGENCIES THROUGHOUT THE MEASUREMENT PERIOD IN ORDER TO OBTAIN SUFFICIENT INFORMATION TO ASSESS WHETHER WE INCLUDE THESE CONTINGENCIES AS\nA PART OF THE FAIR VALUE ESTIMATES OF ASSETS ACQUIRED AND LIABILITIES ASSUMED AND, IF SO, TO DETERMINE THEIR ESTIMATED AMOUNTS.\nIF WE CANNOT\nREASONABLY DETERMINE THE FAIR VALUE OF A PRE-ACQUISITION CONTINGENCY (NON-INCOME TAX RELATED) BY THE END OF THE MEASUREMENT PERIOD, WHICH IS GENERALLY THE CASE GIVEN THE NATURE OF SUCH MATTERS, WE WILL RECOGNIZE AN ASSET OR A LIABILITY FOR SUCH\nPRE-ACQUISITION CONTINGENCY IF: (I) IT IS PROBABLE THAT AN ASSET EXISTED OR A LIABILITY HAD BEEN INCURRED AT THE ACQUISITION DATE AND (II) THE AMOUNT OF THE ASSET OR LIABILITY CAN BE REASONABLY ESTIMATED. SUBSEQUENT TO THE MEASUREMENT\nPERIOD, CHANGES IN OUR ESTIMATES OF SUCH CONTINGENCIES WILL AFFECT EARNINGS AND COULD HAVE A MATERIAL EFFECT ON OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL POSITION.\nIN ADDITION, UNCERTAIN TAX POSITIONS AND TAX RELATED VALUATION ALLOWANCES ASSUMED IN CONNECTION WITH A BUSINESS COMBINATION ARE INITIALLY ESTIMATED AS OF THE ACQUISITION DATE. WE REEVALUATE THESE ITEMS\nQUARTERLY BASED UPON FACTS AND CIRCUMSTANCES THAT EXISTED AS OF THE ACQUISITION DATE WITH ANY ADJUSTMENTS TO OUR PRELIMINARY ESTIMATES BEING RECORDED TO GOODWILL IF IDENTIFIED WITHIN THE MEASUREMENT PERIOD. SUBSEQUENT TO THE MEASUREMENT PERIOD OR\nOUR FINAL DETERMINATION OF THE TAX ALLOWANCE\u0092S OR CONTINGENCY\u0092S ESTIMATED VALUE, WHICHEVER COMES FIRST, CHANGES TO THESE UNCERTAIN TAX POSITIONS AND TAX RELATED VALUATION ALLOWANCES WILL AFFECT OUR PROVISION FOR INCOME TAXES IN OUR\nCONSOLIDATED STATEMENT OF OPERATIONS AND COULD HAVE A MATERIAL IMPACT ON OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL POSITION.\nGOODWILL AND\nINTANGIBLE ASSETS\n\u0097\nIMPAIRMENT ASSESSMENTS\nWE REVIEW GOODWILL FOR IMPAIRMENT ANNUALLY AND WHENEVER EVENTS OR CHANGES\nIN CIRCUMSTANCES INDICATE ITS CARRYING VALUE MAY NOT BE RECOVERABLE IN ACCORDANCE WITH ASC 350,\nINTANGIBLES\u0097GOODWILL AND OTHER\n. ACCORDING TO ASC 350, WE CAN OPT TO PERFORM A QUALITATIVE ASSESSMENT TO TEST A REPORTING UNIT\u0092S GOODWILL\nFOR IMPAIRMENT OR WE CAN DIRECTLY PERFORM THE TWO STEP IMPAIRMENT TEST. BASED ON OUR QUALITATIVE ASSESSMENT, IF WE DETERMINE THAT THE FAIR VALUE OF A REPORTING UNIT IS MORE LIKELY THAN NOT (I.E., A LIKELIHOOD OF MORE THAN 50 PERCENT) TO BE LESS THAN\nITS CARRYING AMOUNT, THE TWO STEP IMPAIRMENT TEST WILL BE PERFORMED. IN THE FIRST STEP, WE COMPARE THE FAIR VALUE OF EACH REPORTING UNIT TO ITS CARRYING VALUE. IF THE FAIR VALUE OF THE REPORTING UNIT EXCEEDS THE CARRYING VALUE OF THE NET ASSETS\nASSIGNED TO THAT UNIT, GOODWILL IS NOT CONSIDERED IMPAIRED AND WE ARE NOT REQUIRED TO PERFORM FURTHER TESTING. IF THE CARRYING VALUE OF THE NET ASSETS ASSIGNED TO THE REPORTING UNIT EXCEEDS THE FAIR VALUE OF THE REPORTING UNIT, THEN WE MUST PERFORM\nTHE SECOND STEP OF THE IMPAIRMENT TEST IN ORDER TO DETERMINE THE IMPLIED FAIR VALUE OF THE REPORTING UNIT\u0092S GOODWILL. IF THE CARRYING VALUE OF A REPORTING UNIT\u0092S GOODWILL EXCEEDS ITS IMPLIED FAIR VALUE, THEN WE WOULD RECORD AN IMPAIRMENT\nLOSS EQUAL TO THE DIFFERENCE.\nDETERMINING THE FAIR VALUE OF A REPORTING UNIT INVOLVES THE USE OF SIGNIFICANT ESTIMATES AND ASSUMPTIONS. THESE\nESTIMATES AND ASSUMPTIONS INCLUDE REVENUE GROWTH RATES AND OPERATING MARGINS USED TO CALCULATE PROJECTED FUTURE CASH FLOWS, RISK-ADJUSTED DISCOUNT RATES, FUTURE ECONOMIC AND MARKET CONDITIONS AND DETERMINATION OF APPROPRIATE MARKET COMPARABLES. WE\nBASE OUR FAIR VALUE ESTIMATES ON ASSUMPTIONS WE BELIEVE TO BE REASONABLE BUT THAT ARE UNPREDICTABLE AND INHERENTLY UNCERTAIN. ACTUAL FUTURE RESULTS MAY DIFFER FROM THOSE ESTIMATES. IN ADDITION, WE MAKE CERTAIN JUDGMENTS AND ASSUMPTIONS IN ALLOCATING\nSHARED ASSETS AND LIABILITIES TO DETERMINE THE CARRYING VALUES FOR EACH OF OUR REPORTING UNITS. OUR MOST RECENT ANNUAL GOODWILL IMPAIRMENT ANALYSIS, WHICH WAS PERFORMED ON MARCH 1, 2014, DID NOT RESULT IN A GOODWILL IMPAIRMENT CHARGE, NOR DID\nWE RECORD ANY GOODWILL IMPAIRMENT IN FISCAL 2013 OR 2012. OUR CONSULTING AND HARDWARE SYSTEMS PRODUCTS REPORTING UNITS HAVE EXPERIENCED REVENUES AND OPERATING MARGIN DECLINES IN FISCAL 2014 AS COMPARED TO PRIOR YEARS. AS A RESULT, OUR CONSULTING AND\nHARDWARE SYSTEMS PRODUCTS REPORTING UNITS MAY BE AT GREATER RISK FOR GOODWILL IMPAIRMENT THAN OUR OTHER REPORTING UNITS IF OUR ACTUAL RESULTS FOR THESE REPORTING UNITS DIFFER FROM OUR PROJECTIONS.\n47\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nWE MAKE JUDGMENTS ABOUT THE RECOVERABILITY OF PURCHASED FINITE LIVED INTANGIBLE ASSETS WHENEVER EVENTS OR\nCHANGES IN CIRCUMSTANCES INDICATE THAT AN IMPAIRMENT MAY EXIST. EACH PERIOD WE EVALUATE THE ESTIMATED REMAINING USEFUL LIVES OF PURCHASED INTANGIBLE ASSETS AND WHETHER EVENTS OR CHANGES IN CIRCUMSTANCES WARRANT A REVISION TO THE REMAINING PERIODS OF\nAMORTIZATION. RECOVERABILITY OF FINITE LIVED INTANGIBLE ASSETS IS MEASURED BY COMPARISON OF THE CARRYING AMOUNT OF THE ASSET TO THE FUTURE UNDISCOUNTED CASH FLOWS THE ASSET IS EXPECTED TO GENERATE. WE REVIEW INDEFINITE LIVED INTANGIBLE ASSETS FOR\nIMPAIRMENT ANNUALLY AND WHENEVER EVENTS OR CHANGES IN CIRCUMSTANCES INDICATE THE CARRYING VALUE MAY NOT BE RECOVERABLE. RECOVERABILITY OF INDEFINITE LIVED INTANGIBLE ASSETS IS MEASURED BY COMPARISON OF THE CARRYING AMOUNT OF THE ASSET TO ITS FAIR\nVALUE. IF THE ASSET IS CONSIDERED TO BE IMPAIRED, THE AMOUNT OF ANY IMPAIRMENT IS MEASURED AS THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE CARRYING VALUE AND THE FAIR VALUE OF THE IMPAIRED ASSET.\nASSUMPTIONS AND ESTIMATES ABOUT FUTURE VALUES AND REMAINING USEFUL LIVES OF OUR INTANGIBLE AND OTHER LONG-LIVED ASSETS ARE COMPLEX AND SUBJECTIVE. THEY CAN BE AFFECTED BY A VARIETY OF FACTORS, INCLUDING\nEXTERNAL FACTORS SUCH AS INDUSTRY AND ECONOMIC TRENDS AND INTERNAL FACTORS SUCH AS CHANGES IN OUR BUSINESS STRATEGY AND OUR INTERNAL FORECASTS. ALTHOUGH WE BELIEVE THE HISTORICAL ASSUMPTIONS AND ESTIMATES WE HAVE MADE ARE REASONABLE AND APPROPRIATE,\nDIFFERENT ASSUMPTIONS AND ESTIMATES COULD MATERIALLY IMPACT OUR REPORTED FINANCIAL RESULTS. WE DID NOT RECOGNIZE ANY INTANGIBLE ASSET IMPAIRMENT CHARGES IN FISCAL 2014, 2013 OR 2012.\nACCOUNTING FOR INCOME TAXES\nSIGNIFICANT JUDGMENT IS REQUIRED IN DETERMINING OUR\nWORLDWIDE INCOME TAX PROVISION. IN THE ORDINARY COURSE OF A GLOBAL BUSINESS, THERE ARE MANY TRANSACTIONS AND CALCULATIONS WHERE THE ULTIMATE TAX OUTCOME IS UNCERTAIN. SOME OF THESE UNCERTAINTIES ARISE AS A CONSEQUENCE OF REVENUE SHARING AND COST\nREIMBURSEMENT ARRANGEMENTS AMONG RELATED ENTITIES, THE PROCESS OF IDENTIFYING ITEMS OF REVENUES AND EXPENSES THAT QUALIFY FOR PREFERENTIAL TAX TREATMENT AND SEGREGATION OF FOREIGN AND DOMESTIC EARNINGS AND EXPENSES TO AVOID DOUBLE TAXATION. ALTHOUGH\nWE BELIEVE THAT OUR ESTIMATES ARE REASONABLE, THE FINAL TAX OUTCOME OF THESE MATTERS COULD BE DIFFERENT FROM THAT WHICH IS REFLECTED IN OUR HISTORICAL INCOME TAX PROVISIONS AND ACCRUALS. SUCH DIFFERENCES COULD HAVE A MATERIAL EFFECT ON OUR INCOME\nTAX PROVISION AND NET INCOME IN THE PERIOD IN WHICH SUCH DETERMINATION IS MADE.\nOUR EFFECTIVE TAX RATE INCLUDES THE IMPACT OF CERTAIN\nUNDISTRIBUTED FOREIGN EARNINGS FOR WHICH NO U.S. TAXES HAVE BEEN PROVIDED BECAUSE SUCH EARNINGS ARE PLANNED TO BE INDEFINITELY REINVESTED OUTSIDE THE UNITED STATES. REMITTANCES OF FOREIGN EARNINGS TO THE UNITED STATES ARE PLANNED BASED ON PROJECTED\nCASH FLOW, WORKING CAPITAL AND INVESTMENT NEEDS OF OUR FOREIGN AND DOMESTIC OPERATIONS. BASED ON THESE ASSUMPTIONS, WE ESTIMATE THE AMOUNT THAT WILL BE DISTRIBUTED TO THE UNITED STATES AND PROVIDE U.S. FEDERAL TAXES ON THESE AMOUNTS. MATERIAL\nCHANGES IN OUR ESTIMATES AS TO HOW MUCH OF OUR FOREIGN EARNINGS WILL BE DISTRIBUTED TO THE UNITED STATES OR TAX LEGISLATION THAT LIMITS OR RESTRICTS THE AMOUNT OF UNDISTRIBUTED FOREIGN EARNINGS THAT WE CONSIDER INDEFINITELY REINVESTED OUTSIDE THE\nUNITED STATES COULD MATERIALLY IMPACT OUR INCOME TAX PROVISION AND EFFECTIVE TAX RATE.\nWE RECORD A VALUATION ALLOWANCE TO REDUCE OUR DEFERRED\nTAX ASSETS TO THE AMOUNT THAT IS MORE LIKELY THAN NOT TO BE REALIZED. IN ORDER FOR US TO REALIZE OUR DEFERRED TAX ASSETS, WE MUST BE ABLE TO GENERATE SUFFICIENT TAXABLE INCOME IN THOSE JURISDICTIONS WHERE THE DEFERRED TAX ASSETS ARE LOCATED. WE\nCONSIDER FUTURE GROWTH, FORECASTED EARNINGS, FUTURE TAXABLE INCOME, THE MIX OF EARNINGS IN THE JURISDICTIONS IN WHICH WE OPERATE, HISTORICAL EARNINGS, TAXABLE INCOME IN PRIOR YEARS, IF CARRYBACK IS PERMITTED UNDER THE LAW AND PRUDENT AND FEASIBLE\nTAX PLANNING STRATEGIES IN DETERMINING THE NEED FOR A VALUATION ALLOWANCE. IN THE EVENT WE WERE TO DETERMINE THAT WE WOULD NOT BE ABLE TO REALIZE ALL OR PART OF OUR NET DEFERRED TAX ASSETS IN THE FUTURE, AN ADJUSTMENT TO THE DEFERRED TAX ASSETS\nVALUATION ALLOWANCE WOULD BE CHARGED TO EARNINGS IN THE PERIOD IN WHICH WE MAKE SUCH A DETERMINATION, OR GOODWILL WOULD BE ADJUSTED AT OUR FINAL DETERMINATION OF THE VALUATION ALLOWANCE RELATED TO AN ACQUISITION WITHIN THE MEASUREMENT PERIOD. IF WE\nLATER DETERMINE THAT IT IS MORE LIKELY THAN NOT THAT THE NET DEFERRED TAX ASSETS WOULD BE REALIZED, WE WOULD REVERSE THE APPLICABLE PORTION OF THE PREVIOUSLY PROVIDED VALUATION ALLOWANCE AS AN ADJUSTMENT TO EARNINGS AT SUCH TIME.\nWE CALCULATE OUR CURRENT AND DEFERRED TAX PROVISION BASED ON ESTIMATES AND ASSUMPTIONS THAT COULD DIFFER FROM THE ACTUAL RESULTS REFLECTED IN INCOME TAX\nRETURNS FILED DURING THE SUBSEQUENT YEAR. ADJUSTMENTS BASED ON FILED RETURNS ARE GENERALLY RECORDED IN THE PERIOD WHEN THE TAX RETURNS ARE FILED AND THE GLOBAL TAX IMPLICATIONS ARE KNOWN, WHICH CAN MATERIALLY IMPACT OUR EFFECTIVE TAX RATE.\nTHE AMOUNT OF INCOME TAX WE PAY IS SUBJECT TO ONGOING AUDITS BY FEDERAL, STATE AND FOREIGN TAX AUTHORITIES, WHICH OFTEN RESULT IN PROPOSED\nASSESSMENTS. OUR ESTIMATE OF THE POTENTIAL OUTCOME FOR ANY UNCERTAIN TAX ISSUE IS HIGHLY\n48\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nJUDGMENTAL. A DESCRIPTION OF OUR ACCOUNTING POLICIES ASSOCIATED WITH TAX RELATED CONTINGENCIES ASSUMED AS A PART OF A BUSINESS COMBINATION IS PROVIDED UNDER \u0093BUSINESS COMBINATIONS\u0094\nABOVE. FOR THOSE TAX RELATED CONTINGENCIES THAT ARE NOT A PART OF A BUSINESS COMBINATION, WE ACCOUNT FOR THESE UNCERTAIN TAX ISSUES PURSUANT TO ASC 740,\nINCOME TAXES\n, WHICH CONTAINS A TWO-STEP APPROACH TO RECOGNIZING AND MEASURING UNCERTAIN\nTAX POSITIONS TAKEN OR EXPECTED TO BE TAKEN IN A TAX RETURN. THE FIRST STEP IS TO DETERMINE IF THE WEIGHT OF AVAILABLE EVIDENCE INDICATES THAT IT IS MORE LIKELY THAN NOT THAT THE TAX POSITION WILL BE SUSTAINED IN AN AUDIT, INCLUDING RESOLUTION OF\nANY RELATED APPEALS OR LITIGATION PROCESSES. THE SECOND STEP IS TO MEASURE THE TAX BENEFIT AS THE LARGEST AMOUNT THAT IS MORE THAN 50% LIKELY TO BE REALIZED UPON ULTIMATE SETTLEMENT. ALTHOUGH WE BELIEVE WE HAVE ADEQUATELY RESERVED FOR OUR UNCERTAIN\nTAX POSITIONS, NO ASSURANCE CAN BE GIVEN WITH RESPECT TO THE FINAL OUTCOME OF THESE MATTERS. WE ADJUST RESERVES FOR OUR UNCERTAIN TAX POSITIONS DUE TO CHANGING FACTS AND CIRCUMSTANCES, SUCH AS THE CLOSING OF A TAX AUDIT, JUDICIAL RULINGS, AND\nREFINEMENT OF ESTIMATES OR REALIZATION OF EARNINGS OR DEDUCTIONS THAT DIFFER FROM OUR ESTIMATES. TO THE EXTENT THAT THE FINAL OUTCOME OF THESE MATTERS IS DIFFERENT THAN THE AMOUNTS RECORDED, SUCH DIFFERENCES GENERALLY WILL IMPACT OUR PROVISION FOR\nINCOME TAXES IN THE PERIOD IN WHICH SUCH A DETERMINATION IS MADE. OUR PROVISIONS FOR INCOME TAXES INCLUDE THE IMPACT OF RESERVE PROVISIONS AND CHANGES TO RESERVES THAT ARE CONSIDERED APPROPRIATE AND ALSO INCLUDE THE RELATED INTEREST AND PENALTIES.\nIN ADDITION, AS A PART OF OUR ACCOUNTING FOR BUSINESS COMBINATIONS, INTANGIBLE ASSETS ARE RECOGNIZED AT FAIR VALUES AND GOODWILL IS MEASURED\nAS THE EXCESS OF CONSIDERATION TRANSFERRED OVER THE NET ESTIMATED FAIR VALUES OF ASSETS ACQUIRED. IMPAIRMENT CHARGES ASSOCIATED WITH GOODWILL ARE GENERALLY NOT TAX DEDUCTIBLE AND WILL RESULT IN AN INCREASED EFFECTIVE INCOME TAX RATE IN THE PERIOD\nTHAT ANY IMPAIRMENT IS RECORDED. AMORTIZATION EXPENSES ASSOCIATED WITH ACQUIRED INTANGIBLE ASSETS ARE GENERALLY NOT TAX DEDUCTIBLE PURSUANT TO OUR EXISTING TAX STRUCTURE; HOWEVER, DEFERRED TAXES HAVE BEEN RECORDED FOR NON-DEDUCTIBLE AMORTIZATION\nEXPENSES AS A PART OF THE ACCOUNTING FOR BUSINESS COMBINATIONS. WE HAVE TAKEN INTO ACCOUNT THE ALLOCATION OF THESE IDENTIFIED INTANGIBLES AMONG DIFFERENT TAXING JURISDICTIONS, INCLUDING THOSE WITH NOMINAL OR ZERO PERCENT TAX RATES, IN ESTABLISHING\nTHE RELATED DEFERRED TAX LIABILITIES.\nLEGAL AND OTHER CONTINGENCIES\nWE ARE CURRENTLY INVOLVED IN VARIOUS CLAIMS AND LEGAL PROCEEDINGS. QUARTERLY, WE REVIEW THE STATUS OF EACH SIGNIFICANT MATTER AND ASSESS OUR POTENTIAL FINANCIAL EXPOSURE. A DESCRIPTION OF OUR ACCOUNTING\nPOLICIES ASSOCIATED WITH CONTINGENCIES ASSUMED AS A PART OF A BUSINESS COMBINATION IS PROVIDED UNDER \u0093BUSINESS COMBINATIONS\u0094 ABOVE. FOR LEGAL AND OTHER CONTINGENCIES THAT ARE NOT A PART OF A BUSINESS COMBINATION, WE ACCRUE A LIABILITY FOR\nAN ESTIMATED LOSS IF THE POTENTIAL LOSS FROM ANY CLAIM OR LEGAL PROCEEDING IS CONSIDERED PROBABLE AND THE AMOUNT CAN BE REASONABLY ESTIMATED. SIGNIFICANT JUDGMENT IS REQUIRED IN BOTH THE DETERMINATION OF PROBABILITY AND THE DETERMINATION AS TO\nWHETHER THE AMOUNT OF AN EXPOSURE IS REASONABLY ESTIMABLE. BECAUSE OF UNCERTAINTIES RELATED TO THESE MATTERS, ACCRUALS ARE BASED ONLY ON THE BEST INFORMATION AVAILABLE AT THE TIME THE ACCRUALS ARE MADE. AS ADDITIONAL INFORMATION BECOMES AVAILABLE,\nWE REASSESS THE POTENTIAL LIABILITY RELATED TO OUR PENDING CLAIMS AND LITIGATION AND MAY REVISE OUR ESTIMATES. SUCH REVISIONS IN THE ESTIMATES OF THE POTENTIAL LIABILITIES COULD HAVE A MATERIAL IMPACT ON OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL\nPOSITION.\nSTOCK-BASED COMPENSATION\nWE ACCOUNT FOR SHARE-BASED PAYMENTS TO EMPLOYEES, INCLUDING GRANTS OF EMPLOYEE STOCK OPTIONS, RESTRICTED STOCK-BASED AWARDS AND PURCHASES UNDER EMPLOYEE STOCK PURCHASE PLANS, IN ACCORDANCE WITH ASC 718,\nCOMPENSATION\u0097STOCK COMPENSATION,\nWHICH REQUIRES THAT SHARE-BASED PAYMENTS (TO THE EXTENT THEY ARE COMPENSATORY) BE RECOGNIZED IN OUR CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF OPERATIONS BASED ON THEIR FAIR VALUES. WE RECOGNIZE STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION\nEXPENSE ON A STRAIGHT-LINE BASIS OVER THE SERVICE PERIOD OF THE AWARD, WHICH IS GENERALLY FOUR YEARS.\nWE ARE REQUIRED TO ESTIMATE THE STOCK\nAWARDS THAT WE ULTIMATELY EXPECT TO VEST AND TO REDUCE STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION EXPENSE FOR THE EFFECTS OF ESTIMATED FORFEITURES OF AWARDS OVER THE EXPENSE RECOGNITION PERIOD. ALTHOUGH WE ESTIMATE THE RATE OF FUTURE FORFEITURES BASED UPON HISTORICAL\nEXPERIENCE, ACTUAL FORFEITURES IN THE FUTURE MAY DIFFER. TO THE EXTENT OUR ACTUAL FORFEITURES ARE DIFFERENT THAN OUR ESTIMATES, WE RECORD A TRUE-UP FOR THE DIFFERENCE IN THE PERIOD THAT THE AWARDS VEST AND SUCH TRUE-UPS COULD MATERIALLY AFFECT OUR\nOPERATING RESULTS. ADDITIONALLY, WE ALSO CONSIDER ON A QUARTERLY BASIS WHETHER THERE HAVE BEEN ANY SIGNIFICANT CHANGES IN FACTS AND CIRCUMSTANCES THAT WOULD AFFECT OUR EXPECTED FORFEITURE RATE.\n49\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nWE ESTIMATE THE FAIR VALUES OF EMPLOYEE STOCK OPTIONS USING A BLACK-SCHOLES-MERTON VALUATION MODEL. THE FAIR\nVALUE OF AN AWARD IS AFFECTED BY OUR STOCK PRICE ON THE DATE OF GRANT AS WELL AS OTHER ASSUMPTIONS INCLUDING THE ESTIMATED VOLATILITY OF OUR STOCK PRICE OVER THE TERM OF THE AWARDS AND THE ESTIMATED PERIOD OF TIME THAT WE EXPECT EMPLOYEES TO HOLD\nTHEIR STOCK OPTIONS. THE RISK-FREE INTEREST RATE ASSUMPTION WE USE IS BASED UPON U.S. TREASURY INTEREST RATES APPROPRIATE FOR THE EXPECTED LIFE OF THE AWARDS. WE USE THE IMPLIED VOLATILITY OF PUBLICLY TRADED OPTIONS IN OUR STOCK IN ORDER TO ESTIMATE\nFUTURE STOCK PRICE TRENDS AS WE BELIEVE THAT IMPLIED VOLATILITY IS MORE REPRESENTATIVE OF FUTURE STOCK PRICE TRENDS THAN HISTORICAL VOLATILITY. IN ORDER TO DETERMINE THE ESTIMATED PERIOD OF TIME THAT WE EXPECT EMPLOYEES TO HOLD THEIR STOCK OPTIONS,\nWE HAVE USED HISTORICAL RATES OF EMPLOYEE GROUPS BY SENIORITY OF JOB CLASSIFICATION. OUR EXPECTED DIVIDEND RATE IS BASED UPON AN ANNUALIZED DIVIDEND YIELD BASED ON THE PER SHARE DIVIDEND DECLARED BY OUR BOARD OF DIRECTORS. THE AFOREMENTIONED INPUTS\nENTERED INTO THE OPTION VALUATION MODEL WE USE TO FAIR VALUE OUR STOCK AWARDS ARE SUBJECTIVE ESTIMATES AND CHANGES TO THESE ESTIMATES WILL CAUSE THE FAIR VALUES OF OUR STOCK AWARDS AND RELATED STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION EXPENSE THAT WE RECORD TO VARY.\nWE RECORD DEFERRED TAX ASSETS FOR STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION AWARDS THAT RESULT IN DEDUCTIONS ON OUR INCOME TAX RETURNS, BASED ON THE AMOUNT OF\nSTOCK-BASED COMPENSATION RECOGNIZED AND THE FAIR VALUES ATTRIBUTABLE TO THE VESTED PORTION OF STOCK AWARDS ASSUMED IN CONNECTION WITH A BUSINESS COMBINATION, AT THE STATUTORY TAX RATE IN THE JURISDICTION IN WHICH WE WILL RECEIVE A TAX DEDUCTION.\nBECAUSE THE DEFERRED TAX ASSETS WE RECORD ARE BASED UPON THE STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION EXPENSES IN A PARTICULAR JURISDICTION, THE AFOREMENTIONED INPUTS THAT AFFECT THE FAIR VALUES OF OUR STOCK AWARDS MAY ALSO INDIRECTLY AFFECT OUR INCOME TAX EXPENSE.\nIN ADDITION, DIFFERENCES BETWEEN THE DEFERRED TAX ASSETS RECOGNIZED FOR FINANCIAL REPORTING PURPOSES AND THE ACTUAL TAX DEDUCTION REPORTED ON OUR INCOME TAX RETURNS ARE RECORDED IN ADDITIONAL PAID-IN CAPITAL. IF THE TAX DEDUCTION IS LESS THAN THE\nDEFERRED TAX ASSET, THE CALCULATED SHORTFALL REDUCES OUR POOL OF EXCESS TAX BENEFITS. IF THE POOL OF EXCESS TAX BENEFITS IS REDUCED TO ZERO, THEN SUBSEQUENT SHORTFALLS WOULD INCREASE OUR INCOME TAX EXPENSE.\nTO THE EXTENT WE CHANGE THE TERMS OF OUR EMPLOYEE STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION PROGRAMS, EXPERIENCE MARKET VOLATILITY IN THE PRICING OF OUR COMMON STOCK THAT\nINCREASES THE IMPLIED VOLATILITY CALCULATION OF PUBLICLY TRADED OPTIONS IN OUR STOCK, REFINE DIFFERENT ASSUMPTIONS IN FUTURE PERIODS SUCH AS FORFEITURE RATES THAT DIFFER FROM OUR CURRENT ESTIMATES, OR ASSUME STOCK AWARDS FROM ACQUIRED COMPANIES THAT\nARE DIFFERENT IN NATURE THAN OUR STOCK AWARD ARRANGEMENTS, AMONG OTHER POTENTIAL IMPACTS, THE STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION EXPENSE THAT WE RECORD IN FUTURE PERIODS AND THE TAX BENEFITS THAT WE REALIZE MAY DIFFER SIGNIFICANTLY FROM WHAT WE HAVE RECORDED\nIN PREVIOUS REPORTING PERIODS.\nRESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nIMPACT OF ACQUISITIONS\nTHE COMPARABILITY OF OUR OPERATING RESULTS IN FISCAL 2014\nCOMPARED TO FISCAL 2013 IS IMPACTED BY OUR ACQUISITIONS, PRIMARILY OUR ACQUISITIONS OF RESPONSYS IN THE THIRD QUARTER OF FISCAL 2014, TEKELEC IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF FISCAL 2014 AND ACME PACKET IN THE FOURTH QUARTER OF FISCAL 2013.\nTHE COMPARABILITY OF OUR OPERATING RESULTS IN FISCAL 2013 COMPARED TO FISCAL 2012 IS IMPACTED BY OUR ACQUISITIONS, PRIMARILY OUR ACQUISITIONS OF ACME\nPACKET IN THE FOURTH QUARTER OF FISCAL 2013, TALEO CORPORATION (TALEO) IN THE FOURTH QUARTER OF FISCAL 2012 AND RIGHTNOW TECHNOLOGIES, INC. (RIGHTNOW) DURING THE THIRD QUARTER OF FISCAL 2012.\nIN OUR DISCUSSION OF CHANGES IN OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS FROM FISCAL 2014 COMPARED TO FISCAL 2013 AND FISCAL 2013 COMPARED TO FISCAL 2012, WE MAY QUALITATIVELY DISCLOSE THE IMPACTS OF OUR ACQUIRED\nPRODUCTS (FOR THE ONE YEAR PERIOD SUBSEQUENT TO THE ACQUISITION DATE) TO THE GROWTH IN OUR NEW SOFTWARE LICENSES REVENUES, CLOUD SAAS AND PAAS REVENUES, SOFTWARE LICENSE UPDATES AND PRODUCT SUPPORT REVENUES, HARDWARE SYSTEMS PRODUCTS REVENUES AND\nHARDWARE SYSTEMS SUPPORT REVENUES WHERE SUCH QUALITATIVE DISCUSSIONS WOULD BE MEANINGFUL FOR AN UNDERSTANDING OF THE FACTORS THAT INFLUENCED THE CHANGES IN OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS. WHEN MATERIAL, WE MAY ALSO PROVIDE QUANTITATIVE DISCLOSURES\nRELATED TO SUCH ACQUIRED PRODUCTS. THE CONTRIBUTIONS OF OUR ACQUISITIONS TO OUR OTHER BUSINESSES AND OPERATING SEGMENTS\u0092 REVENUES AND TO THE EXPENSE CONTRIBUTIONS FOR SUBSTANTIALLY ALL OF OUR BUSINESSES AND OPERATING SEGMENTS IN EACH OF THE\nRESPECTIVE PERIOD COMPARISONS ARE NOT PROVIDED AS THEY EITHER WERE NOT SEPARATELY IDENTIFIABLE DUE TO THE INTEGRATION OF THESE BUSINESSES AND OPERATING SEGMENTS INTO OUR EXISTING OPERATIONS AND\/OR WERE INSIGNIFICANT TO OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nDURING THE PERIODS PRESENTED.\n50\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nWE CAUTION READERS THAT, WHILE PRE- AND POST-ACQUISITION COMPARISONS, AS WELL AS ANY QUANTIFIED AMOUNTS\nTHEMSELVES, MAY PROVIDE INDICATIONS OF GENERAL TRENDS, THE ACQUISITION INFORMATION THAT WE PROVIDE HAS INHERENT LIMITATIONS FOR THE FOLLOWING REASONS.\n\u0095\nANY QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE DISCLOSURES CANNOT SPECIFICALLY ADDRESS OR QUANTIFY THE SUBSTANTIAL EFFECTS ATTRIBUTABLE TO CHANGES IN BUSINESS\nSTRATEGIES, INCLUDING OUR SALES FORCE INTEGRATION EFFORTS. WE BELIEVE THAT IF OUR ACQUIRED COMPANIES HAD OPERATED INDEPENDENTLY AND SALES FORCES HAD NOT BEEN INTEGRATED, THE RELATIVE MIX OF PRODUCTS SOLD WOULD HAVE BEEN DIFFERENT; AND\n\u0095\nALTHOUGH SUBSTANTIALLY ALL OF OUR CUSTOMERS, INCLUDING CUSTOMERS FROM ACQUIRED COMPANIES, RENEW THEIR SOFTWARE LICENSE UPDATES AND PRODUCT SUPPORT\nCONTRACTS WHEN THE CONTRACTS ARE ELIGIBLE FOR RENEWAL AND WE STRIVE TO RENEW CLOUD SAAS AND PAAS CONTRACTS AND HARDWARE SYSTEMS SUPPORT CONTRACTS, THE AMOUNTS SHOWN AS CLOUD SOFTWARE-AS-A-SERVICE AND PLATFORM-AS-A-SERVICE DEFERRED REVENUES, SOFTWARE\nLICENSE UPDATES AND PRODUCT SUPPORT DEFERRED REVENUES, AND HARDWARE SYSTEMS SUPPORT DEFERRED REVENUES IN OUR SUPPLEMENTAL DISCLOSURE RELATED TO CERTAIN CHARGES (PRESENTED BELOW) ARE NOT NECESSARILY INDICATIVE OF REVENUE IMPROVEMENTS WE WILL ACHIEVE\nUPON CONTRACT RENEWALS TO THE EXTENT CUSTOMERS DO NOT RENEW.\nCONSTANT CURRENCY PRESENTATION\nOUR INTERNATIONAL OPERATIONS HAVE PROVIDED AND WILL CONTINUE TO PROVIDE A SIGNIFICANT PORTION OF OUR TOTAL REVENUES AND EXPENSES. AS A RESULT, TOTAL\nREVENUES AND EXPENSES WILL CONTINUE TO BE AFFECTED BY CHANGES IN THE U.S. DOLLAR AGAINST MAJOR INTERNATIONAL CURRENCIES. IN ORDER TO PROVIDE A FRAMEWORK FOR ASSESSING HOW OUR UNDERLYING BUSINESSES PERFORMED EXCLUDING THE EFFECT OF FOREIGN\nCURRENCY FLUCTUATIONS, WE COMPARE THE PERCENT CHANGE IN THE RESULTS FROM ONE PERIOD TO ANOTHER PERIOD IN THIS ANNUAL REPORT USING CONSTANT CURRENCY DISCLOSURE. TO PRESENT THIS INFORMATION, CURRENT AND COMPARATIVE PRIOR PERIOD RESULTS FOR ENTITIES\nREPORTING IN CURRENCIES OTHER THAN U.S. DOLLARS ARE CONVERTED INTO U.S. DOLLARS AT CONSTANT EXCHANGE RATES (I.E., THE RATES IN EFFECT ON MAY 31, 2013, WHICH WAS THE LAST DAY OF OUR PRIOR FISCAL YEAR) RATHER THAN THE ACTUAL EXCHANGE RATES IN\nEFFECT DURING THE RESPECTIVE PERIODS. FOR EXAMPLE, IF AN ENTITY REPORTING IN EUROS HAD REVENUES OF 1.0 MILLION EUROS FROM PRODUCTS SOLD ON MAY 31, 2014 AND 2013, OUR FINANCIAL STATEMENTS WOULD REFLECT REPORTED REVENUES OF $1.36 MILLION IN\nFISCAL 2014 (USING 1.36 AS THE MONTH-END AVERAGE EXCHANGE RATE FOR THE PERIOD) AND $1.29 MILLION IN FISCAL 2013 (USING 1.29 AS THE MONTH-END AVERAGE EXCHANGE RATE FOR THE PERIOD). THE CONSTANT CURRENCY PRESENTATION WOULD TRANSLATE THE FISCAL 2014\nRESULTS USING THE FISCAL 2013 EXCHANGE RATE AND INDICATE, IN THIS EXAMPLE, NO CHANGE IN REVENUES DURING THE PERIOD. IN EACH OF THE TABLES BELOW, WE PRESENT THE PERCENT CHANGE BASED ON ACTUAL, UNROUNDED RESULTS IN REPORTED CURRENCY AND IN CONSTANT\nCURRENCY.\n51\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nTOTAL REVENUES AND OPERATING EXPENSES\nYEAR ENDED MAY 31,\nPERCENT CHANGE\nPERCENT CHANGE\n(DOLLARS IN MILLIONS)\n2014\nACTUAL\nCONSTANT\n2013\nACTUAL\nCONSTANT\n2012\nTOTAL REVENUES BY GEOGRAPHY.\nAMERICAS\n$20,323\n3%\n4%\n$19,719\n3%\n3%\n$19,236\nEMEA\n(1)\n11,946\n7%\n4%\n11,158\n-3%\n0%\n11,561\nASIA PACIFIC\n(2)\n6,006\n-5%\n2%\n6,303\n0%\n3%\n6,324\nTOTAL REVENUES\n38,275\n3%\n4%\n37,180\n0%\n2%\n37,121\nTOTAL OPERATING EXPENSES\n23,516\n5%\n6%\n22,496\n-4%\n-2%\n23,415\nTOTAL OPERATING MARGIN\n$14,759\n1%\n1%\n$14,684\n7%\n10%\n$13,706\nTOTAL OPERATING MARGIN %\n39%\n39%\n37%% REVENUES BY GEOGRAPHY.\nAMERICAS\n53%\n53%\n52%\nEMEA\n31%\n30%\n31%\nASIA PACIFIC\n16%\n17%\n17%\nTOTAL REVENUES BY BUSINESS.\nSOFTWARE AND CLOUD\n$29,199\n5%\n5%\n$27,920\n5%\n7%\n$26,560\nHARDWARE SYSTEMS\n5,372\n0%\n2%\n5,346\n-15%\n-13%\n6,302\nSERVICES\n3,704\n-5%\n-4%\n3,914\n-8%\n-6%\n4,259\nTOTAL REVENUES\n$38,275\n3%\n4%\n$37,180\n0%\n2%\n$37,121% REVENUES BY BUSINESS.\nSOFTWARE AND CLOUD\n76%\n75%\n72%\nHARDWARE SYSTEMS\n14%\n14%\n17%\nSERVICES\n10%\n11%\n11%\n(1)\nCOMPRISED OF EUROPE, THE MIDDLE EAST AND AFRICA\n(2)\nASIA PACIFIC INCLUDES JAPAN\nFISCAL 2014 COMPARED TO FISCAL 2013.\nON A CONSTANT CURRENCY BASIS, OUR TOTAL REVENUES INCREASED IN FISCAL 2014 BY 4\nPERCENTAGE POINTS DUE TO INCREASES IN OUR SOFTWARE AND CLOUD BUSINESS REVENUES AND OUR HARDWARE BUSINESS REVENUES, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY A DECREASE IN OUR SERVICES BUSINESS REVENUES. THE CONSTANT CURRENCY GROWTH IN OUR SOFTWARE AND CLOUD BUSINESS WAS\nSUBSTANTIALLY ATTRIBUTABLE TO GROWTH IN OUR SOFTWARE LICENSE UPDATES AND PRODUCT SUPPORT REVENUES AND, TO A LESSER EXTENT, OUR CLOUD SOFTWARE-AS-A-SERVICE (SAAS) AND PLATFORM-AS-A-SERVICE (PAAS) REVENUES DUE TO INCREMENTAL REVENUES FROM OUR\nACQUISITIONS. THE CONSTANT CURRENCY REVENUES GROWTH IN OUR HARDWARE BUSINESS WAS DUE TO AN INCREASE IN OUR HARDWARE SYSTEMS SUPPORT REVENUES DUE SUBSTANTIALLY TO INCREMENTAL REVENUES FROM OUR ACQUISITIONS AND DUE TO INCREASES IN OUR HARDWARE\nREVENUES ATTRIBUTABLE TO OUR ORACLE ENGINEERED SYSTEMS, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY REVENUE DECREASES ATTRIBUTABLE TO REDUCTIONS IN THE SALES VOLUMES OF CERTAIN OF OUR LEGACY HARDWARE PRODUCT LINES, INCLUDING LOWER MARGIN PRODUCTS. ON A CONSTANT CURRENCY\nBASIS, THE AMERICAS CONTRIBUTED 61%, EMEA CONTRIBUTED 30% AND ASIA PACIFIC CONTRIBUTED 9% TO OUR TOTAL REVENUES GROWTH DURING FISCAL 2014.\nTOTAL CONSTANT CURRENCY OPERATING EXPENSES INCREASED DURING FISCAL 2014 PRIMARILY DUE TO AN INCREASE IN SALES AND MARKETING AND RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT EXPENSES RESULTING FROM INCREASED HEADCOUNT, HIGHER\nSALES-BASED VARIABLE COMPENSATION EXPENSES DUE TO REVENUES GROWTH, AND AN INCREASE IN CLOUD SAAS AND PAAS COSTS RESULTING FROM ADDITIONAL EXPENSES INCURRED TO SUPPORT THE INCREASES IN OUR CLOUD SAAS AND PAAS REVENUES. THESE EXPENSE INCREASES IN\nFISCAL 2014 WERE PARTIALLY OFFSET BY LOWER CONSTANT CURRENCY EXPENSES FROM OUR HARDWARE SYSTEMS SUPPORT AND SERVICES SEGMENTS DUE TO DECREASED HEADCOUNT, LOWER RESTRUCTURING EXPENSES, AND LOWER INTANGIBLE ASSETS AMORTIZATION. IN FISCAL 2013, WE\nRECOGNIZED A $387 MILLION ACQUISITION RELATED BENEFIT (SEE NOTE 2 OF NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS INCLUDED ELSEWHERE IN THIS ANNUAL REPORT FOR ADDITIONAL INFORMATION) AND A $306 MILLION BENEFIT RELATING TO CERTAIN LITIGATION (SEE NOTE\n18 OF NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS INCLUDED ELSEWHERE IN THIS ANNUAL REPORT FOR ADDITIONAL INFORMATION), BOTH OF WHICH DECREASED OUR ACQUISITION RELATED AND OTHER EXPENSES DURING THIS PERIOD.\nEXCLUDING THE EFFECT OF FOREIGN CURRENCY RATE FLUCTUATIONS, OUR OPERATING MARGIN INCREASED DURING FISCAL 2014 DUE TO OUR REVENUES GROWTH, WHILE OUR\nOPERATING MARGIN AS A PERCENTAGE OF REVENUES WAS FLAT.\n52\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nFISCAL 2013 COMPARED TO FISCAL 2012.\nEXCLUDING THE EFFECT OF FOREIGN\nCURRENCY RATE FLUCTUATIONS, OUR TOTAL REVENUES INCREASED IN FISCAL 2013 DUE TO AN INCREASE IN OUR SOFTWARE AND CLOUD BUSINESS REVENUES. THIS CONSTANT CURRENCY INCREASE WAS PARTIALLY OFFSET BY REDUCTIONS IN OUR HARDWARE SYSTEMS AND SERVICES\nBUSINESS\u0092 REVENUES. ON A CONSTANT CURRENCY BASIS, THE AMERICAS REGION CONTRIBUTED 77% AND THE ASIA PACIFIC REGION CONTRIBUTED 23% TO OUR GROWTH IN TOTAL REVENUES DURING FISCAL 2013.\nEXCLUDING THE EFFECT OF FOREIGN CURRENCY RATE FLUCTUATIONS, TOTAL OPERATING EXPENSES DECREASED IN FISCAL 2013 PRIMARILY DUE TO A $387 MILLION ACQUISITION RELATED BENEFIT AND A $306 MILLION BENEFIT RELATED\nTO CERTAIN LITIGATION (BOTH AS NOTED ABOVE), LOWER HARDWARE SYSTEMS PRODUCTS COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH LOWER HARDWARE SYSTEMS PRODUCTS REVENUES, AND CERTAIN OTHER OPERATING EXPENSE DECREASES IN MOST OF OUR OTHER LINES OF BUSINESS PRIMARILY DUE TO LOWER\nVARIABLE COMPENSATION EXPENSES, LOWER EXTERNAL CONTRACTOR EXPENSES AND LOWER AMORTIZATION OF INTANGIBLE ASSETS. IN CONSTANT CURRENCY, THESE TOTAL EXPENSE DECREASES DURING FISCAL 2013 WERE PARTIALLY OFFSET BY HIGHER SALARY AND BENEFIT EXPENSES DUE\nPRIMARILY TO ADDITIONAL SALES AND MARKETING AND RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT HEADCOUNT ADDED DURING FISCAL 2013.\nEXCLUDING THE EFFECT OF FOREIGN\nCURRENCY RATE FLUCTUATIONS, OUR TOTAL OPERATING MARGIN AND OUR TOTAL OPERATING MARGIN AS A PERCENTAGE OF TOTAL REVENUES INCREASED DURING FISCAL 2013 DUE TO THE INCREASE IN OUR TOTAL REVENUES AND THE DECREASE IN OUR TOTAL OPERATING EXPENSES.\nSUPPLEMENTAL DISCLOSURE RELATED TO CERTAIN CHARGES\nTO SUPPLEMENT OUR CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL INFORMATION, WE BELIEVE THE FOLLOWING INFORMATION IS HELPFUL TO AN OVERALL UNDERSTANDING OF OUR PAST FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE AND PROSPECTS FOR THE FUTURE.

THIS INCREASE WAS PARTIALLY OFFSET BY CASH USED FOR REPURCHASES OF OUR COMMON STOCK (WE USED $11.0 BILLION OF\nCASH FOR COMMON STOCK REPURCHASES DURING FISCAL 2013), CASH USED TO PAY DIVIDENDS TO OUR STOCKHOLDERS, AND CASH USED FOR ACQUISITIONS.\nCASH, CASH EQUIVALENTS AND MARKETABLE SECURITIES.\nCASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS PRIMARILY CONSIST OF DEPOSITS HELD AT\nMAJOR BANKS, TIER-1 COMMERCIAL PAPER AND OTHER SECURITIES WITH ORIGINAL MATURITIES OF 90 DAYS OR LESS. MARKETABLE SECURITIES PRIMARILY CONSIST OF TIME DEPOSITS HELD AT MAJOR BANKS, TIER-1 COMMERCIAL PAPER, CORPORATE NOTES, AND CERTAIN OTHER\nSECURITIES. THE INCREASE IN CASH, CASH EQUIVALENTS AND MARKETABLE SECURITIES AT MAY 31, 2014 IN COMPARISON TO MAY 31, 2013 WAS DUE TO AN INCREASE IN CASH GENERATED FROM OUR OPERATING ACTIVITIES, OUR ISSUANCE OF \u00802.0 BILLION AND $3.0\nBILLION OF SENIOR NOTES IN JULY 2013, AND TO A LESSER EXTENT, CASH PROCEEDS FROM STOCK OPTION EXERCISES. THESE INCREASES WERE PARTIALLY OFFSET BY $9.8 BILLION OF REPURCHASES OF OUR COMMON STOCK, $3.5 BILLION OF NET CASH PAID FOR ACQUISITIONS AND\n$2.2 BILLION USED FOR THE PAYMENT OF CASH DIVIDENDS TO OUR STOCKHOLDERS. CASH, CASH EQUIVALENTS AND MARKETABLE SECURITIES INCLUDED $35.2 BILLION HELD BY OUR FOREIGN SUBSIDIARIES AS OF MAY 31, 2014. WE CONSIDER $32.4 BILLION OF OUR UNDISTRIBUTED\nEARNINGS AS INDEFINITELY REINVESTED IN OUR FOREIGN OPERATIONS OUTSIDE THE UNITED STATES. THESE UNDISTRIBUTED EARNINGS WOULD BE SUBJECT TO U.S. INCOME TAX IF REPATRIATED TO THE UNITED STATES. ASSUMING A FULL UTILIZATION OF THE FOREIGN TAX CREDITS,\nTHE POTENTIAL DEFERRED TAX LIABILITY ASSOCIATED WITH THESE UNDISTRIBUTED EARNINGS WOULD BE APPROXIMATELY $10.0 BILLION AS OF MAY 31, 2014 SHOULD THE AMOUNTS BE REPATRIATED TO THE UNITED STATES. THE AMOUNT OF CASH, CASH EQUIVALENTS AND\nMARKETABLE SECURITIES THAT WE REPORT IN U.S. DOLLARS FOR A SIGNIFICANT PORTION OF THE CASH HELD BY OUR FOREIGN SUBSIDIARIES IS SUBJECT TO TRANSLATION ADJUSTMENTS CAUSED BY CHANGES IN FOREIGN CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATES AS OF THE END OF EACH RESPECTIVE\nREPORTING PERIOD (THE OFFSET TO WHICH IS SUBSTANTIALLY RECORDED TO ACCUMULATED OTHER COMPREHENSIVE LOSS IN OUR CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS AND IS ALSO PRESENTED AS A LINE ITEM IN OUR CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF COMPREHENSIVE INCOME INCLUDED ELSEWHERE\nIN THIS ANNUAL REPORT). AS THE U.S. DOLLAR MODESTLY STRENGTHENED AGAINST CERTAIN MAJOR INTERNATIONAL CURRENCIES DURING FISCAL 2014, THE AMOUNT OF CASH, CASH EQUIVALENTS AND MARKETABLE SECURITIES THAT WE REPORTED IN U.S. DOLLARS FOR THESE\nSUBSIDIARIES DECREASED ON A NET BASIS AS OF MAY 31, 2014 RELATIVE TO WHAT WE WOULD HAVE REPORTED USING CONSTANT CURRENCY RATES FROM OUR MAY 31, 2013 BALANCE SHEET DATE.\nTHE INCREASE IN CASH, CASH EQUIVALENTS AND MARKETABLE SECURITIES AT MAY 31, 2013 IN COMPARISON TO MAY 31, 2012 WAS DUE TO AN INCREASE IN CASH GENERATED FROM OUR OPERATING ACTIVITIES, OUR\nISSUANCE OF $5.0 BILLION OF SENIOR NOTES IN OCTOBER 2012, AND TO A LESSER EXTENT, CASH PROCEEDS FROM FISCAL 2013 STOCK OPTION EXERCISES. THIS INCREASE WAS PARTIALLY OFFSET BY $11.0 BILLION OF REPURCHASES OF OUR COMMON STOCK, $3.3 BILLION OF NET CASH\nPAID FOR ACQUISITIONS, THE REPAYMENTS OF $1.7 BILLION OF SHORT-TERM BORROWINGS PURSUANT TO OUR EXPIRED REVOLVING CREDIT FACILITIES, THE REPAYMENT OF $1.25 BILLION OF SENIOR NOTES WHICH MATURED IN APRIL 2013, AND THE PAYMENT OF CASH DIVIDENDS TO OUR\nSTOCKHOLDERS. ADDITIONALLY, OUR REPORTED CASH, CASH EQUIVALENTS AND MARKETABLE SECURITIES BALANCES AS OF MAY 31, 2013 DECREASED IN COMPARISON TO MAY 31, 2012 DUE TO THE GENERAL STRENGTHENING OF THE U.S. DOLLAR IN COMPARISON TO CERTAIN\nMAJOR INTERNATIONAL CURRENCIES DURING FISCAL 2013.\nDAYS SALES OUTSTANDING, WHICH WAS CALCULATED BY DIVIDING PERIOD END ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE BY\nAVERAGE DAILY SALES FOR THE QUARTER, WAS 48 DAYS AT MAY 31, 2014 COMPARED WITH 50 DAYS AT MAY 31, 2013.

IN ADDITION, WE BELIEVE WE COULD FUND ANY FUTURE ACQUISITIONS, DIVIDEND PAYMENTS AND REPURCHASES OF COMMON STOCK OR DEBT WITH OUR INTERNALLY AVAILABLE CASH, CASH EQUIVALENTS AND MARKETABLE SECURITIES, CASH GENERATED FROM\nOPERATIONS, ADDITIONAL BORROWINGS OR FROM THE ISSUANCE OF ADDITIONAL SECURITIES.\nOFF-BALANCE SHEET\nARRANGEMENTS.\nWE DO NOT HAVE ANY OFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS THAT HAVE OR ARE REASONABLY LIKELY TO HAVE A CURRENT OR FUTURE EFFECT ON OUR FINANCIAL CONDITION, CHANGES IN FINANCIAL CONDITION, REVENUES OR EXPENSES,\nRESULTS OF OPERATIONS, LIQUIDITY, CAPITAL EXPENDITURES OR CAPITAL RESOURCES THAT ARE MATERIAL TO INVESTORS.\nSELECTED QUARTERLY FINANCIAL\nDATA\nQUARTERLY REVENUES, EXPENSES AND OPERATING INCOME HAVE HISTORICALLY BEEN AFFECTED BY A VARIETY OF SEASONAL FACTORS, INCLUDING SALES\nFORCE INCENTIVE COMPENSATION PLANS. IN ADDITION, OUR EUROPEAN OPERATIONS GENERALLY PROVIDE LOWER REVENUES IN OUR FIRST FISCAL QUARTER BECAUSE OF THE REDUCED ECONOMIC ACTIVITY IN EUROPE DURING THE SUMMER. THESE SEASONAL FACTORS ARE COMMON IN THE HIGH\nTECHNOLOGY INDUSTRY. THESE FACTORS HAVE CAUSED A DECREASE IN OUR FIRST QUARTER REVENUES AS COMPARED TO REVENUES IN THE IMMEDIATELY PRECEDING FOURTH QUARTER, WHICH HISTORICALLY HAS BEEN OUR HIGHEST REVENUE QUARTER WITHIN A PARTICULAR FISCAL YEAR.\nSIMILARLY, THE OPERATING INCOME OF OUR BUSINESS IS AFFECTED BY SEASONAL FACTORS IN A CONSISTENT MANNER AS OUR REVENUES (IN PARTICULAR, OUR NEW SOFTWARE LICENSES AND CLOUD SOFTWARE SUBSCRIPTIONS SEGMENT) AS CERTAIN EXPENSES WITHIN OUR COST STRUCTURE\nARE RELATIVELY FIXED IN THE SHORT-TERM.

MANAGEMENT\u0092S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nTHE FOLLOWING MANAGEMENT\u0092S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS (\u0093MD&A\u0094) IS INTENDED TO HELP THE READER UNDERSTAND THE RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nAND FINANCIAL CONDITION OF MICROSOFT CORPORATION. MD&A IS PROVIDED AS A SUPPLEMENT TO, AND SHOULD BE READ IN CONJUNCTION WITH, OUR CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND THE ACCOMPANYING NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.\nOVERVIEW\nMICROSOFT IS A\nTECHNOLOGY LEADER FOCUSED ON BEING THE PRODUCTIVITY AND PLATFORM COMPANY FOR THE MOBILE-FIRST AND CLOUD-FIRST WORLD. WE STRIVE TO REINVENT PRODUCTIVITY TO EMPOWER PEOPLE AND ORGANIZATIONS TO DO MORE AND ACHIEVE MORE. WE CREATE TECHNOLOGY THAT\nTRANSFORMS THE WAY PEOPLE WORK, PLAY, AND COMMUNICATE ACROSS A WIDE RANGE OF COMPUTING DEVICES.\nWE GENERATE REVENUE BY DEVELOPING,\nLICENSING, AND SUPPORTING A WIDE RANGE OF SOFTWARE PRODUCTS, BY OFFERING AN ARRAY OF SERVICES, INCLUDING CLOUD-BASED SERVICES TO CONSUMERS AND BUSINESSES, BY DESIGNING, MANUFACTURING, AND SELLING DEVICES THAT INTEGRATE WITH OUR CLOUD-BASED SERVICES,\nAND BY DELIVERING RELEVANT ONLINE ADVERTISING TO A GLOBAL AUDIENCE. OUR MOST SIGNIFICANT EXPENSES ARE RELATED TO COMPENSATING EMPLOYEES, DESIGNING, MANUFACTURING, MARKETING, AND SELLING OUR PRODUCTS AND SERVICES, DATACENTER COSTS IN SUPPORT OF OUR\nCLOUD-BASED SERVICES, AND INCOME TAXES.\nINDUSTRY TRENDS\nOUR INDUSTRY IS DYNAMIC AND HIGHLY COMPETITIVE, WITH FREQUENT CHANGES IN BOTH TECHNOLOGIES AND BUSINESS MODELS. EACH INDUSTRY SHIFT IS AN OPPORTUNITY TO CONCEIVE NEW PRODUCTS, NEW TECHNOLOGIES, OR NEW IDEAS THAT\nCAN FURTHER TRANSFORM THE INDUSTRY AND OUR BUSINESS. AT MICROSOFT, WE PUSH THE BOUNDARIES OF WHAT IS POSSIBLE THROUGH A BROAD RANGE OF RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT ACTIVITIES THAT SEEK TO IDENTIFY AND ADDRESS THE CHANGING DEMANDS OF CUSTOMERS, INDUSTRY\nTRENDS, AND COMPETITIVE FORCES.\nKEY OPPORTUNITIES AND INVESTMENTS\nWE SEE SIGNIFICANT OPPORTUNITIES FOR GROWTH BY INVESTING RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT RESOURCES IN THE FOLLOWING AREAS.\n\u0095\nDIGITAL WORK AND LIFE EXPERIENCES\n\u0095\nOUR CLOUD OPERATING SYSTEM\n\u0095\nOUR DEVICES OPERATING SYSTEM AND HARDWARE\n26\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nPART II\nITEM 7\nWITH INVESTMENTS IN THESE AREAS, WE WORK TO FULFILL THE EVOLVING NEEDS OF OUR CUSTOMERS IN A\nMOBILE-FIRST AND CLOUD-FIRST WORLD. WE VIEW MOBILITY BROADLY \u0096 NOT JUST BY DEVICES, BUT BY EXPERIENCES. TODAY, PEOPLE MOVE JUST AS QUICKLY INTO NEW CONTEXTS AS TO NEW LOCATIONS. MOBILITY GOES BEYOND DEVICES USERS CARRY WITH THEM AS THEY MOVE\nFROM PLACE TO PLACE, TO ENCOMPASS THE RICH COLLECTION OF DATA, APPLICATIONS, AND SERVICES THAT ACCOMPANY THEM AS THEY MOVE FROM SETTING TO SETTING IN THEIR LIVES. MANY OF OUR CUSTOMERS ARE \u0093DUAL USERS,\u0094 EMPLOYING TECHNOLOGY FOR WORK OR\nSCHOOL AND ALSO DEEPLY IN THEIR PERSONAL LIVES.\nDIGITAL WORK AND LIFE EXPERIENCES\nWE BELIEVE WE CAN SIGNIFICANTLY ENHANCE THE DIGITAL LIVES OF OUR CUSTOMERS USING OUR BROAD PORTFOLIO OF COMMUNICATION, PRODUCTIVITY, AND\nINFORMATION SERVICES. WE WORK TO DELIVER DIGITAL WORK AND LIFE EXPERIENCES THAT ARE REINVENTED FOR THE MOBILE-FIRST AND CLOUD-FIRST WORLD. PRODUCTIVITY WILL BE THE FIRST AND FOREMOST OBJECTIVE, TO ENABLE PEOPLE TO MEET AND COLLABORATE MORE EASILY,\nAND TO EFFECTIVELY EXPRESS IDEAS IN NEW WAYS. WE WILL DESIGN APPLICATIONS AS DUAL USE WITH THE INTELLIGENCE TO PARTITION DATA BETWEEN WORK AND LIFE WHILE RESPECTING EACH PERSON\u0092S PRIVACY CHOICES. THE FOUNDATION FOR THESE EFFORTS WILL REST ON\nADVANCING OUR LEADING PRODUCTIVITY, COLLABORATION, AND BUSINESS PROCESS TOOLS INCLUDING SKYPE, ONEDRIVE, ONENOTE, OUTLOOK, WORD, EXCEL, POWERPOINT, BING, AND DYNAMICS.\nWE SEE OPPORTUNITY IN COMBINING THESE SERVICES IN NEW WAYS THAT ARE MORE CONTEXTUAL AND PERSONAL, WHILE ENSURING PEOPLE, RATHER THAN THEIR DEVICES, REMAIN AT THE CENTER OF THE DIGITAL EXPERIENCE. WE WILL OFFER OUR\nSERVICES ACROSS ECOSYSTEMS AND DEVICES OUTSIDE OUR OWN. AS PEOPLE MOVE FROM DEVICE TO DEVICE, SO WILL THEIR CONTENT AND THE RICHNESS OF THEIR SERVICES. WE WILL ENGINEER APPLICATIONS SO USERS CAN FIND, TRY, AND BUY THEM IN FRICTION-FREE WAYS.\nCLOUD OPERATING SYSTEM\nTODAY,\nBUSINESSES FACE IMPORTANT OPPORTUNITIES AND CHALLENGES. ENTERPRISES ARE ASKED TO DEPLOY TECHNOLOGY THAT ADVANCES BUSINESS STRATEGY. THEY DECIDE WHAT SOLUTIONS WILL MAKE EMPLOYEES MORE PRODUCTIVE, COLLABORATIVE, AND SATISFIED, OR CONNECT WITH\nCUSTOMERS IN NEW AND COMPELLING WAYS. THEY WORK TO UNLOCK BUSINESS INSIGHTS FROM A WORLD OF DATA. THEY RELY ON OUR TECHNOLOGY TO MANAGE EMPLOYEE CORPORATE IDENTITY, AND TO MANAGE AND SECURE CORPORATE INFORMATION ACCESSED AND STORED ACROSS A GROWING\nNUMBER OF DEVICES. TO ACHIEVE THESE OBJECTIVES INCREASINGLY BUSINESSES LOOK TO LEVERAGE THE BENEFITS OF THE CLOUD. HELPING BUSINESSES MOVE TO THE CLOUD IS ONE OF OUR LARGEST OPPORTUNITIES, AND WE BELIEVE WE WORK FROM A POSITION OF STRENGTH.\nTHE SHIFT TO THE CLOUD IS DRIVEN BY THREE IMPORTANT ECONOMIES OF SCALE: LARGER DATACENTERS CAN DEPLOY COMPUTATIONAL RESOURCES AT\nSIGNIFICANTLY LOWER COST PER UNIT THAN SMALLER ONES; LARGER DATACENTERS CAN COORDINATE AND AGGREGATE DIVERSE CUSTOMER, GEOGRAPHIC, AND APPLICATION DEMAND PATTERNS IMPROVING THE UTILIZATION OF COMPUTING, STORAGE, AND NETWORK RESOURCES; AND\nMULTI-TENANCY LOWERS APPLICATION MAINTENANCE LABOR COSTS FOR LARGE PUBLIC CLOUDS. THE CLOUD CREATES THE OPPORTUNITY FOR BUSINESSES TO FOCUS ON INNOVATION WHILE LEAVING NON-DIFFERENTIATING ACTIVITIES TO RELIABLE AND COST-EFFECTIVE PROVIDERS.\nWITH AZURE, WE ARE ONE OF VERY FEW CLOUD VENDORS THAT RUN AT A SCALE THAT MEETS THE NEEDS OF BUSINESSES OF ALL SIZES AND COMPLEXITIES.\nWE BELIEVE THE COMBINATION OF AZURE AND WINDOWS SERVER MAKES US THE ONLY COMPANY WITH A PUBLIC, PRIVATE, AND HYBRID CLOUD PLATFORM THAT CAN POWER MODERN BUSINESS. WE ARE WORKING TO ENHANCE THE RETURN ON IT INVESTMENT BY ENABLING ENTERPRISES TO\nCOMBINE THEIR EXISTING DATACENTERS AND OUR PUBLIC CLOUD INTO A SINGLE COHESIVE INFRASTRUCTURE. BUSINESSES CAN DEPLOY APPLICATIONS IN THEIR OWN DATACENTER, A PARTNER\u0092S DATACENTER, OR IN OUR DATACENTERS WITH COMMON SECURITY, MANAGEMENT, AND\nADMINISTRATION ACROSS ALL ENVIRONMENTS, WITH THE FLEXIBILITY AND SCALE THEY DESIRE.\nOUR CLOUD WILL ALSO ENABLE RICHER EMPLOYEE\nEXPERIENCES. WE ENABLE ORGANIZATIONS TO SECURELY ADOPT SOFTWARE-AS-A-SERVICE APPLICATIONS (BOTH OUR OWN AND THIRD-PARTY) AND INTEGRATE THEM WITH THEIR EXISTING SECURITY AND MANAGEMENT INFRASTRUCTURE. WE WILL CONTINUE TO INNOVATE WITH HIGHER LEVEL\nSERVICES INCLUDING IDENTITY AND DIRECTORY SERVICES, RICH DATA STORAGE AND ANALYTICS SERVICES, MACHINE LEARNING SERVICES, MEDIA SERVICES, WEB, AND MOBILE BACKEND SERVICES, AND DEVELOPER PRODUCTIVITY SERVICES. TO FOSTER A RICH DEVELOPER ECOSYSTEM, OUR\nDIGITAL WORK\n27\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nPART II\nITEM 7\nAND LIFE EXPERIENCES WILL ALSO BE EXTENSIBLE, ENABLING CUSTOMERS AND PARTNERS TO FURTHER CUSTOMIZE AND ENHANCE OUR SOLUTIONS, ACHIEVING EVEN MORE VALUE. OUR STRATEGY REQUIRES CONTINUING\nINVESTMENT IN DATACENTERS AND OTHER INFRASTRUCTURE TO SUPPORT OUR DEVICES AND SERVICES, AND WILL BRING CONTINUED COMPETITION WITH GOOGLE, AMAZON, AND OTHER WELL-ESTABLISHED AND EMERGING COMPETITORS.\nDEVICE OPERATING SYSTEM AND HARDWARE\nWITH\nOUR WINDOWS DEVICE OPERATING SYSTEM AND FIRST-PARTY HARDWARE, WE STRIVE TO SET THE STANDARD FOR PRODUCTIVITY EXPERIENCES. WE AIM TO DELIVER THE RICHEST AND MOST CONSISTENT USER EXPERIENCE FOR DIGITAL WORK AND LIFE SCENARIOS ON SCREENS OF ALL SIZES\n\u0096 FROM PHONES, TABLETS, AND LAPTOPS TO TVS AND LARGE, MULTI-TOUCH DISPLAYS. WE ARE INVESTING TO MAKE WINDOWS THE MOST SECURE, MANAGEABLE, AND CAPABLE OPERATING SYSTEM FOR THE NEEDS OF A MODERN WORKFORCE. WE ARE WORKING TO CREATE A BROAD\nDEVELOPER OPPORTUNITY BY ENABLING UNIVERSAL WINDOWS APPLICATIONS TO RUN ACROSS ALL DEVICE TARGETS. WE ARE DEVELOPING NEW INPUT\/OUTPUT METHODS LIKE SPEECH, PEN, AND GESTURE TO POWER MORE PERSONAL COMPUTING EXPERIENCES.\nWE WORK WITH AN ECOSYSTEM OF PARTNERS TO DELIVER A BROAD SPECTRUM OF WINDOWS DEVICES. WE ALSO BUILD FIRST-PARTY HARDWARE TO SET THE STANDARD FOR\nPRODUCTIVITY EXPERIENCES AND STIMULATE MORE DEMAND FOR THE ENTIRE WINDOWS ECOSYSTEM, AS WE DO WITH SURFACE, AND WITH THE ACQUISITION OF SUBSTANTIALLY ALL NOKIA CORPORATION\u0092S (\u0093NOKIA\u0094) DEVICES AND SERVICES BUSINESS (\u0093NDS\u0094) ON\nAPRIL 25, 2014, PHONES. AS CONSUMER SERVICES AND HARDWARE ADVANCE, WE EXPECT THEY WILL CONTINUE TO BETTER COMPLEMENT ONE ANOTHER, CONNECTING THE DEVICES PEOPLE USE DAILY TO UNIQUE COMMUNICATIONS, PRODUCTIVITY, AND ENTERTAINMENT SERVICES FROM\nMICROSOFT AND OUR PARTNERS AND DEVELOPERS. WE ANTICIPATE MANY NEW MOBILE DEVICE CATEGORIES AND WE ANTICIPATE EXPERIENCES TO EMERGE THAT SPAN A VARIETY OF DEVICES OF ALL SCREEN SIZES. WE WILL INVEST TO BE ON THE FOREFRONT OF THIS INNOVATION FOCUSING\nON DUAL USERS AND THEIR NEEDS ACROSS WORK AND LIFE. WITH THE ACQUISITION OF NDS, WE EXPECT OUR EFFECTIVE TAX RATE TO INCREASE AS OUR BUSINESS MIX CHANGES.\nOUR FUTURE OPPORTUNITY\nTHERE ARE SEVERAL DISTINCT AREAS OF TECHNOLOGY THAT WE AIM TO DRIVE\nFORWARD. OUR GOAL IS TO LEAD THE INDUSTRY IN THESE AREAS OVER THE LONG TERM, WHICH WE EXPECT WILL TRANSLATE TO SUSTAINED GROWTH. WE ARE INVESTING SIGNIFICANT RESOURCES IN.\n\u0095\nDELIVERING NEW HIGH-VALUE DIGITAL WORK AND DIGITAL LIFE EXPERIENCES TO IMPROVE HOW PEOPLE LEARN, WORK, PLAY, AND INTERACT WITH ONE ANOTHER.\n\u0095\nESTABLISHING OUR WINDOWS PLATFORM ACROSS THE PC, TABLET, PHONE, SERVER, OTHER DEVICES, AND THE CLOUD TO DRIVE A THRIVING ECOSYSTEM OF DEVELOPERS, UNIFY THE\nCROSS-DEVICE USER EXPERIENCE, AND INCREASE AGILITY WHEN BRINGING NEW ADVANCES TO MARKET.\n\u0095\nBUILDING AND RUNNING CLOUD-BASED SERVICES IN WAYS THAT UNLEASH NEW EXPERIENCES AND OPPORTUNITIES FOR BUSINESSES AND INDIVIDUALS.\n\u0095\nDEVELOPING NEW DEVICES THAT HAVE INCREASINGLY NATURAL WAYS TO USE THEM, INCLUDING TOUCH, GESTURE, AND SPEECH.\n\u0095\nAPPLYING MACHINE LEARNING TO MAKE TECHNOLOGY MORE INTUITIVE AND ABLE TO ACT ON OUR BEHALF, INSTEAD OF AT OUR COMMAND.\nWE BELIEVE THE BREADTH OF OUR PRODUCTS AND SERVICES PORTFOLIO, OUR LARGE, GLOBAL PARTNER AND CUSTOMER BASE, OUR GROWING ECOSYSTEM, AND OUR ONGOING\nINVESTMENT IN INNOVATION POSITION US TO BE A LEADER IN THESE AREAS.\nECONOMIC CONDITIONS, CHALLENGES, AND RISKS\nTHE MARKET FOR SOFTWARE, DEVICES, AND CLOUD-BASED SERVICES IS DYNAMIC AND HIGHLY COMPETITIVE. OUR COMPETITORS ARE DEVELOPING NEW SOFTWARE AND\nDEVICES, WHILE ALSO DEPLOYING COMPETING CLOUD-BASED SERVICES FOR CONSUMERS AND BUSINESSES. THE DEVICES AND FORM FACTORS CUSTOMERS PREFER EVOLVE RAPIDLY, AND INFLUENCE HOW USERS ACCESS SERVICES IN THE CLOUD AND IN SOME CASES THE USER\u0092S CHOICE OF\nWHICH SUITE OF CLOUD-BASED SERVICES TO USE. WE MUST CONTINUE TO EVOLVE AND ADAPT OVER AN EXTENDED TIME IN PACE WITH THIS CHANGING ENVIRONMENT. TO SUPPORT OUR STRATEGY OF\n28\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nPART II\nITEM 7\nREINVENTING PRODUCTIVITY TO EMPOWER EVERY PERSON AND EVERY ORGANIZATION TO DO MORE AND ACHIEVE MORE, WE ANNOUNCED A RESTRUCTURING PLAN IN JULY 2014. THROUGH THIS RESTRUCTURING, WE STRIVE TO\nINCREASE AGILITY, STREAMLINE ENGINEERING PROCESSES, MOVE FASTER AND MORE EFFICIENTLY, AND SIMPLIFY OUR ORGANIZATION. EVEN IF WE ACHIEVE THESE GOALS, THE INVESTMENTS WE ARE MAKING IN DEVICES AND INFRASTRUCTURE WILL INCREASE OUR OPERATING COSTS AND\nMAY DECREASE OUR OPERATING MARGINS.\nWE PRIORITIZE OUR INVESTMENTS AMONG THE HIGHEST LONG-TERM GROWTH OPPORTUNITIES. THESE INVESTMENTS\nREQUIRE SIGNIFICANT RESOURCES AND ARE MULTI-YEAR IN NATURE. THE PRODUCTS AND SERVICES WE BRING TO MARKET MAY BE DEVELOPED INTERNALLY, AS PART OF A PARTNERSHIP OR ALLIANCE, OR THROUGH ACQUISITION.\nOUR SUCCESS IS HIGHLY DEPENDENT ON OUR ABILITY TO ATTRACT AND RETAIN QUALIFIED EMPLOYEES. WE HIRE A MIX OF UNIVERSITY AND INDUSTRY TALENT\nWORLDWIDE. MICROSOFT COMPETES FOR TALENTED INDIVIDUALS GLOBALLY BY OFFERING AN EXCEPTIONAL WORKING ENVIRONMENT, BROAD CUSTOMER REACH, SCALE IN RESOURCES, THE ABILITY TO GROW ONE\u0092S CAREER ACROSS MANY DIFFERENT PRODUCTS AND BUSINESSES, AND\nCOMPETITIVE COMPENSATION AND BENEFITS. AGGREGATE DEMAND FOR OUR SOFTWARE, SERVICES, AND DEVICES IS CORRELATED TO GLOBAL MACROECONOMIC AND GEOPOLITICAL FACTORS, WHICH REMAIN DYNAMIC. SEE A DISCUSSION OF THESE FACTORS AND OTHER RISKS UNDER RISK\nFACTORS (PART I, ITEM 1A OF THIS FORM 10-K).\nUNEARNED REVENUE\nQUARTERLY AND ANNUAL REVENUE MAY BE IMPACTED BY THE DEFERRAL OF REVENUE.

OPERATING EXPENSES ARE NOT ALLOCATED TO OUR SEGMENTS.\nDURING THE FIRST QUARTER OF FISCAL YEAR\n2014, WE CHANGED OUR ORGANIZATIONAL STRUCTURE AS PART OF OUR TRANSFORMATION TO A DEVICES AND SERVICES COMPANY. AS A RESULT, INFORMATION THAT OUR CHIEF OPERATING DECISION MAKER REGULARLY REVIEWS FOR PURPOSES OF ALLOCATING RESOURCES AND ASSESSING\nPERFORMANCE CHANGED. THEREFORE, WE HAVE RECAST CERTAIN PRIOR PERIOD AMOUNTS TO CONFORM TO THE WAY WE INTERNALLY MANAGED AND MONITORED SEGMENT PERFORMANCE DURING FISCAL YEAR 2014. OUR REPORTABLE SEGMENTS ARE DESCRIBED BELOW.\nON APRIL 25, 2014, WE ACQUIRED SUBSTANTIALLY ALL OF NDS FOR TOTAL CONSIDERATION OF $9.5 BILLION. THIS AMOUNT WAS GREATER THAN THE $7.2 BILLION\nDISCLOSED PREVIOUSLY, PRIMARILY DUE TO $1.5 BILLION OF CASH ACQUIRED, FOREIGN CURRENCY MOVEMENTS OF $330 MILLION, WORKING CAPITAL ADJUSTMENTS OF $210 MILLION, AND OTHER ADJUSTMENTS OF $260 MILLION.

OTHER-THAN-TEMPORARY IMPAIRMENTS WERE $208 MILLION IN FISCAL YEAR 2013, COMPARED WITH $298 MILLION IN FISCAL YEAR 2012. NET LOSSES ON DERIVATIVES DECREASED DUE TO GAINS ON EQUITY DERIVATIVES IN THE CURRENT FISCAL\nYEAR AS COMPARED WITH LOSSES IN THE PRIOR FISCAL YEAR, AND LOWER LOSSES ON COMMODITY AND FOREIGN EXCHANGE DERIVATIVES AS COMPARED TO THE PRIOR FISCAL YEAR, OFFSET IN PART BY LOSSES ON INTEREST-RATE DERIVATIVES IN THE CURRENT FISCAL YEAR AS COMPARED\nTO GAINS IN THE PRIOR FISCAL YEAR.

OUR\nEFFECTIVE TAX RATE WAS LOWER THAN THE U.S. FEDERAL STATUTORY RATE PRIMARILY DUE TO EARNINGS TAXED AT LOWER RATES IN FOREIGN JURISDICTIONS RESULTING FROM PRODUCING AND DISTRIBUTING OUR PRODUCTS AND SERVICES THROUGH OUR FOREIGN REGIONAL OPERATIONS\nCENTERS IN IRELAND, SINGAPORE, AND PUERTO RICO.\nOUR FISCAL YEAR 2014 EFFECTIVE RATE INCREASED BY 2% FROM FISCAL YEAR 2013 MAINLY DUE TO\nADJUSTMENTS OF $458 MILLION TO PRIOR YEARS\u0092 LIABILITIES FOR INTERCOMPANY TRANSFER PRICING THAT INCREASED TAXABLE INCOME IN MORE HIGHLY TAXED JURISDICTIONS, AS WELL AS LOSSES INCURRED BY NDS AND CHANGES IN THE GEOGRAPHIC MIX OF OUR BUSINESS.\nTHIS WAS OFFSET IN PART BY FAVORABLE TRANSFER PRICING DEVELOPMENTS IN CERTAIN FOREIGN TAX JURISDICTIONS, PRIMARILY DENMARK.\nCHANGES IN\nTHE MIX OF INCOME BEFORE INCOME TAXES BETWEEN THE U.S. AND FOREIGN COUNTRIES ALSO IMPACTED OUR EFFECTIVE TAX RATES AND RESULTED PRIMARILY FROM CHANGES IN THE GEOGRAPHIC DISTRIBUTION OF AND CHANGES IN CONSUMER DEMAND FOR OUR PRODUCTS AND SERVICES. WE\nSUPPLY OUR WINDOWS PC OPERATING SYSTEM TO CUSTOMERS THROUGH OUR U.S. REGIONAL OPERATING CENTER, WHILE WE SUPPLY THE MICROSOFT OFFICE SYSTEM AND OUR SERVER PRODUCTS AND TOOLS TO CUSTOMERS THROUGH OUR FOREIGN REGIONAL OPERATIONS CENTERS. WINDOWS PC\nOPERATING SYSTEM REVENUE DECREASED $655 MILLION IN FISCAL YEAR 2014, WHILE MICROSOFT OFFICE SYSTEM AND SERVER PRODUCTS AND TOOLS REVENUE INCREASED $1.3 BILLION AND $1.6 BILLION, RESPECTIVELY, DURING THIS SAME PERIOD. IN FISCAL YEARS 2014 AND 2013,\nOUR U.S. INCOME BEFORE INCOME TAXES WAS $7.1 BILLION AND $6.7 BILLION, RESPECTIVELY, AND COMPRISED 26% AND 25%, RESPECTIVELY, OF OUR INCOME BEFORE INCOME TAXES. IN FISCAL YEARS 2014 AND 2013, THE FOREIGN INCOME BEFORE INCOME TAXES WAS $20.7 BILLION\nAND $20.4 BILLION, RESPECTIVELY, AND COMPRISED 74% AND 75%, RESPECTIVELY, OF OUR INCOME BEFORE INCOME TAXES.\nTAX CONTINGENCIES AND\nOTHER TAX LIABILITIES WERE $10.4 BILLION AND $9.4 BILLION AS OF JUNE 30, 2014 AND 2013, RESPECTIVELY, AND ARE INCLUDED IN OTHER LONG-TERM LIABILITIES. THIS INCREASE RELATES PRIMARILY TO ADJUSTMENTS TO PRIOR YEARS\u0092 LIABILITIES FOR\nINTERCOMPANY TRANSFER PRICING AND ADJUSTMENTS RELATED TO OUR IRS AUDITS. WHILE WE SETTLED A PORTION OF THE I.R.S. AUDIT FOR TAX YEARS 2004 TO 2006 DURING THE THIRD QUARTER OF FISCAL YEAR 2011, WE REMAIN UNDER AUDIT FOR THOSE YEARS. IN FEBRUARY 2012,\nTHE I.R.S. WITHDREW ITS 2011 REVENUE AGENTS REPORT AND REOPENED THE AUDIT PHASE OF THE EXAMINATION. AS OF JUNE 30, 2014, THE PRIMARY UNRESOLVED ISSUE RELATES TO TRANSFER PRICING WHICH COULD HAVE A SIGNIFICANT IMPACT ON OUR CONSOLIDATED\nFINANCIAL STATEMENTS IF NOT RESOLVED FAVORABLY. WE HAVE NOT RECEIVED A PROPOSED ASSESSMENT FOR THE UNRESOLVED ISSUES AND DO NOT EXPECT A FINAL RESOLUTION OF THESE ISSUES IN THE NEXT 12 MONTHS. BASED ON THE INFORMATION CURRENTLY AVAILABLE, WE DO\nNOT ANTICIPATE A SIGNIFICANT INCREASE OR DECREASE TO OUR TAX CONTINGENCIES FOR THESE ISSUES. WE ALSO CONTINUE TO BE SUBJECT TO EXAMINATION BY THE I.R.S.

OUR EFFECTIVE TAX RATE WAS LOWER THAN THE U.S.\nFEDERAL STATUTORY RATE PRIMARILY DUE TO EARNINGS TAXED AT LOWER RATES IN FOREIGN JURISDICTIONS RESULTING FROM PRODUCING AND DISTRIBUTING OUR PRODUCTS AND SERVICES THROUGH OUR FOREIGN REGIONAL OPERATIONS CENTERS IN IRELAND, SINGAPORE, AND PUERTO\nRICO.\nOUR FISCAL YEAR 2013 EFFECTIVE RATE DECREASED BY 5% FROM FISCAL YEAR 2012 MAINLY DUE TO A NONRECURRING $6.2 BILLION NON-TAX\nDEDUCTIBLE GOODWILL IMPAIRMENT CHARGE THAT WAS RECORDED IN FISCAL YEAR 2012. THE GOODWILL IMPAIRMENT CHARGE INCREASED OUR EFFECTIVE TAX RATE BY 10% IN FISCAL YEAR 2012. IN ADDITION, IN FISCAL YEARS 2013 AND 2012, WE RECOGNIZED A REDUCTION OF 18% AND\n21%, RESPECTIVELY, TO THE EFFECTIVE TAX RATE DUE TO FOREIGN EARNINGS TAXED AT LOWER RATES. THE DECREASE IN OUR EFFECTIVE TAX RATE FOR FISCAL YEAR 2013 WAS PRIMARILY OFFSET BY A 1% INCREASE RELATED TO THE EU FINE, WHICH IS NOT TAX DEDUCTIBLE.\nCHANGES IN THE MIX OF INCOME BEFORE INCOME TAXES BETWEEN THE U.S. AND FOREIGN COUNTRIES ALSO IMPACTED OUR EFFECTIVE TAX RATES AND\nRESULTED PRIMARILY FROM CHANGES IN THE GEOGRAPHIC DISTRIBUTION OF AND CHANGES IN CONSUMER DEMAND FOR OUR PRODUCTS AND SERVICES. WE SUPPLY OUR WINDOWS PC OPERATING SYSTEM TO CUSTOMERS THROUGH OUR U.S. REGIONAL OPERATING CENTER, WHILE WE SUPPLY THE\nMICROSOFT OFFICE SYSTEM AND OUR SERVER PRODUCTS AND TOOLS TO CUSTOMERS THROUGH OUR FOREIGN REGIONAL OPERATIONS CENTERS. WINDOWS PC OPERATING SYSTEM REVENUE INCREASED $209 MILLION IN FISCAL YEAR 2013, WHILE MICROSOFT OFFICE SYSTEM AND SERVER PRODUCTS\nAND TOOLS REVENUE INCREASED $696 MILLION AND $1.2 BILLION, RESPECTIVELY, DURING THIS SAME PERIOD. IN FISCAL YEARS 2013 AND 2012, OUR U.S. INCOME BEFORE INCOME TAXES WAS $6.7 BILLION AND $1.6 BILLION, RESPECTIVELY, AND COMPRISED 25% AND 7%,\nRESPECTIVELY, OF OUR INCOME BEFORE INCOME TAXES. IN FISCAL YEARS 2013 AND 2012, THE FOREIGN INCOME BEFORE INCOME TAXES WAS $20.4 BILLION AND $20.7 BILLION, RESPECTIVELY, AND COMPRISED 75% AND 93%, RESPECTIVELY, OF OUR INCOME BEFORE INCOME TAXES. THE\nPRIMARY DRIVER FOR THE INCREASE IN THE U.S. INCOME BEFORE INCOME TAX IN FISCAL YEAR 2013 WAS THE GOODWILL IMPAIRMENT CHARGE RECORDED DURING THE PRIOR YEAR.\nTAX CONTINGENCIES AND OTHER TAX LIABILITIES WERE $9.4 BILLION AND $7.6 BILLION AS OF JUNE 30, 2013 AND 2012, RESPECTIVELY, AND ARE INCLUDED IN OTHER LONG-TERM LIABILITIES. THIS INCREASE RELATES PRIMARILY TO\nTRANSFER PRICING, INCLUDING TRANSFER PRICING DEVELOPMENTS IN CERTAIN FOREIGN TAX JURISDICTIONS, PRIMARILY DENMARK. WHILE WE SETTLED A PORTION OF THE I.R.S. AUDIT FOR TAX YEARS 2004 TO 2006 DURING THE THIRD QUARTER OF FISCAL YEAR 2011, WE REMAIN\nUNDER AUDIT FOR THOSE YEARS. IN FEBRUARY 2012, THE I.R.S. WITHDREW ITS 2011 REVENUE AGENTS REPORT AND REOPENED THE AUDIT PHASE OF THE EXAMINATION. AS OF JUNE 30, 2013, THE PRIMARY UNRESOLVED ISSUE RELATES TO TRANSFER PRICING WHICH COULD HAVE A\nSIGNIFICANT IMPACT ON OUR CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS IF NOT RESOLVED FAVORABLY. WE DO NOT BELIEVE IT IS REASONABLY POSSIBLE THAT THE TOTAL AMOUNT OF UNRECOGNIZED TAX BENEFITS WILL SIGNIFICANTLY INCREASE OR DECREASE WITHIN THE NEXT 12 MONTHS\nBECAUSE WE DO NOT BELIEVE THE REMAINING OPEN ISSUES WILL BE RESOLVED WITHIN THE NEXT 12 MONTHS. WE ALSO CONTINUE TO BE SUBJECT TO EXAMINATION BY THE I.R.S. FOR TAX YEARS 2007 TO 2012.\nWE ARE SUBJECT TO INCOME TAX IN MANY JURISDICTIONS OUTSIDE THE U.S. OUR OPERATIONS IN CERTAIN JURISDICTIONS REMAIN SUBJECT TO EXAMINATION FOR TAX\nYEARS 1996 TO 2012, SOME OF WHICH ARE CURRENTLY UNDER AUDIT BY LOCAL TAX AUTHORITIES. THE RESOLUTIONS OF THESE AUDITS ARE NOT EXPECTED TO BE MATERIAL TO OUR CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.\nFINANCIAL CONDITION\nCASH, CASH\nEQUIVALENTS, AND INVESTMENTS\nCASH, CASH EQUIVALENTS, AND SHORT-TERM INVESTMENTS TOTALED $85.7 BILLION AS OF JUNE 30, 2014,\nCOMPARED WITH $77.0 BILLION AS OF JUNE 30, 2013. EQUITY AND OTHER INVESTMENTS WERE $14.6 BILLION AS OF JUNE 30, 2014, COMPARED WITH $10.8 BILLION AS OF JUNE 30, 2013. OUR SHORT-TERM INVESTMENTS ARE PRIMARILY TO FACILITATE LIQUIDITY\nAND FOR CAPITAL PRESERVATION. THEY CONSIST PREDOMINANTLY OF HIGHLY LIQUID INVESTMENT-GRADE FIXED-INCOME SECURITIES, DIVERSIFIED AMONG INDUSTRIES AND INDIVIDUAL ISSUERS. THE INVESTMENTS ARE PREDOMINANTLY U.S. DOLLAR-DENOMINATED SECURITIES, BUT ALSO\nINCLUDE FOREIGN CURRENCY-DENOMINATED SECURITIES IN ORDER TO DIVERSIFY RISK. OUR FIXED-INCOME INVESTMENTS ARE EXPOSED TO INTEREST RATE RISK AND CREDIT RISK. THE CREDIT RISK AND AVERAGE MATURITY OF OUR FIXED-INCOME PORTFOLIO ARE\n40\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nPART II\nITEM 7\nMANAGED TO ACHIEVE ECONOMIC RETURNS THAT CORRELATE TO CERTAIN FIXED-INCOME INDICES. THE SETTLEMENT RISK RELATED TO THESE INVESTMENTS IS INSIGNIFICANT GIVEN THAT THE SHORT-TERM INVESTMENTS HELD\nARE PRIMARILY HIGHLY LIQUID INVESTMENT-GRADE FIXED-INCOME SECURITIES.\nOF THE CASH, CASH EQUIVALENTS, AND SHORT-TERM INVESTMENTS AT\nJUNE 30, 2014, $77.1 BILLION WAS HELD BY OUR FOREIGN SUBSIDIARIES AND WOULD BE SUBJECT TO MATERIAL REPATRIATION TAX EFFECTS. THE AMOUNT OF CASH, CASH EQUIVALENTS, AND SHORT-TERM INVESTMENTS HELD BY FOREIGN SUBSIDIARIES SUBJECT TO OTHER\nRESTRICTIONS ON THE FREE FLOW OF FUNDS (PRIMARILY CURRENCY AND OTHER LOCAL REGULATORY) WAS $2.6 BILLION. AS OF JUNE 30, 2014, APPROXIMATELY 84% OF THE CASH EQUIVALENTS AND SHORT-TERM INVESTMENTS HELD BY OUR FOREIGN SUBSIDIARIES WERE INVESTED IN\nU.S. GOVERNMENT AND AGENCY SECURITIES, APPROXIMATELY 5% WERE INVESTED IN CORPORATE NOTES AND BONDS OF U.S. COMPANIES, AND APPROXIMATELY 1% WERE INVESTED IN U.S. MORTGAGE-BACKED SECURITIES, ALL OF WHICH ARE DENOMINATED IN U.S. DOLLARS.\nSECURITIES LENDING\nWE LEND CERTAIN\nFIXED-INCOME AND EQUITY SECURITIES TO INCREASE INVESTMENT RETURNS. THE LOANED SECURITIES CONTINUE TO BE CARRIED AS INVESTMENTS ON OUR BALANCE SHEET. CASH AND\/OR SECURITY INTERESTS ARE RECEIVED AS COLLATERAL FOR THE LOANED SECURITIES WITH THE AMOUNT\nDETERMINED BASED UPON THE UNDERLYING SECURITY LENT AND THE CREDITWORTHINESS OF THE BORROWER. CASH RECEIVED IS RECORDED AS AN ASSET WITH A CORRESPONDING LIABILITY. OUR SECURITIES LENDING PAYABLE BALANCE WAS $558 MILLION AS OF JUNE 30, 2014. OUR\nAVERAGE AND MAXIMUM SECURITIES LENDING PAYABLE BALANCES FOR THE FISCAL YEAR WERE $619 MILLION AND $1.3 BILLION, RESPECTIVELY. INTRA-YEAR VARIANCES IN THE AMOUNT OF SECURITIES LOANED ARE MAINLY DUE TO FLUCTUATIONS IN THE DEMAND FOR THE SECURITIES.\nVALUATION\nIN GENERAL, AND\nWHERE APPLICABLE, WE USE QUOTED PRICES IN ACTIVE MARKETS FOR IDENTICAL ASSETS OR LIABILITIES TO DETERMINE THE FAIR VALUE OF OUR FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS. THIS PRICING METHODOLOGY APPLIES TO OUR LEVEL 1 INVESTMENTS, SUCH AS EXCHANGE-TRADED MUTUAL FUNDS,\nDOMESTIC AND INTERNATIONAL EQUITIES, AND U.S. GOVERNMENT SECURITIES. IF QUOTED PRICES IN ACTIVE MARKETS FOR IDENTICAL ASSETS OR LIABILITIES ARE NOT AVAILABLE TO DETERMINE FAIR VALUE, THEN WE USE QUOTED PRICES FOR SIMILAR ASSETS AND LIABILITIES OR\nINPUTS OTHER THAN THE QUOTED PRICES THAT ARE OBSERVABLE EITHER DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY. THIS PRICING METHODOLOGY APPLIES TO OUR LEVEL 2 INVESTMENTS SUCH AS CORPORATE NOTES AND BONDS, COMMON AND PREFERRED STOCK, FOREIGN GOVERNMENT BONDS,\nMORTGAGE-BACKED SECURITIES, AND CERTIFICATES OF DEPOSIT. LEVEL 3 INVESTMENTS ARE VALUED USING INTERNALLY DEVELOPED MODELS WITH UNOBSERVABLE INPUTS. ASSETS AND LIABILITIES MEASURED AT FAIR VALUE ON A RECURRING BASIS USING UNOBSERVABLE INPUTS ARE AN\nIMMATERIAL PORTION OF OUR PORTFOLIO.\nA MAJORITY OF OUR INVESTMENTS ARE PRICED BY PRICING VENDORS AND ARE GENERALLY LEVEL 1 OR LEVEL 2\nINVESTMENTS AS THESE VENDORS EITHER PROVIDE A QUOTED MARKET PRICE IN AN ACTIVE MARKET OR USE OBSERVABLE INPUTS FOR THEIR PRICING WITHOUT APPLYING SIGNIFICANT ADJUSTMENTS. BROKER PRICING IS USED MAINLY WHEN A QUOTED PRICE IS NOT AVAILABLE, THE\nINVESTMENT IS NOT PRICED BY OUR PRICING VENDORS, OR WHEN A BROKER PRICE IS MORE REFLECTIVE OF FAIR VALUES IN THE MARKET IN WHICH THE INVESTMENT TRADES. OUR BROKER-PRICED INVESTMENTS ARE GENERALLY CLASSIFIED AS LEVEL 2 INVESTMENTS BECAUSE THE BROKER\nPRICES THESE INVESTMENTS BASED ON SIMILAR ASSETS WITHOUT APPLYING SIGNIFICANT ADJUSTMENTS. IN ADDITION, ALL OF OUR BROKER-PRICED INVESTMENTS HAVE A SUFFICIENT LEVEL OF TRADING VOLUME TO DEMONSTRATE THAT THE FAIR VALUES USED ARE APPROPRIATE FOR THESE\nINVESTMENTS. OUR FAIR VALUE PROCESSES INCLUDE CONTROLS THAT ARE DESIGNED TO ENSURE APPROPRIATE FAIR VALUES ARE RECORDED. THESE CONTROLS INCLUDE MODEL VALIDATION, REVIEW OF KEY MODEL INPUTS, ANALYSIS OF PERIOD-OVER-PERIOD FLUCTUATIONS, AND\nINDEPENDENT RECALCULATION OF PRICES WHERE APPROPRIATE.\nCASH FLOWS\nFISCAL YEAR 2014 COMPARED WITH FISCAL YEAR 2013\nCASH FLOWS FROM OPERATIONS INCREASED $3.4\nBILLION DURING THE CURRENT FISCAL YEAR TO $32.2 BILLION, DUE MAINLY TO INCREASES IN CASH RECEIVED FROM CUSTOMERS.

WE EXPECT EXISTING DOMESTIC CASH, CASH EQUIVALENTS, SHORT-TERM INVESTMENTS, AND CASH FLOWS FROM OPERATIONS TO CONTINUE TO BE SUFFICIENT TO FUND OUR DOMESTIC OPERATING ACTIVITIES AND CASH COMMITMENTS FOR INVESTING AND FINANCING ACTIVITIES,\nSUCH AS REGULAR QUARTERLY DIVIDENDS, DEBT REPAYMENT SCHEDULES, AND MATERIAL CAPITAL EXPENDITURES, FOR AT LEAST THE NEXT 12 MONTHS AND THEREAFTER FOR THE FORESEEABLE FUTURE. IN ADDITION, WE EXPECT EXISTING FOREIGN CASH, CASH EQUIVALENTS, SHORT-TERM\nINVESTMENTS, AND CASH FLOWS FROM OPERATIONS TO CONTINUE TO BE SUFFICIENT TO FUND OUR FOREIGN OPERATING ACTIVITIES AND CASH COMMITMENTS FOR INVESTING ACTIVITIES, SUCH AS MATERIAL CAPITAL EXPENDITURES, FOR AT LEAST THE NEXT 12 MONTHS AND THEREAFTER\nFOR THE FORESEEABLE FUTURE.\nSHOULD WE REQUIRE MORE CAPITAL IN THE U.S. THAN IS GENERATED BY OUR OPERATIONS DOMESTICALLY, FOR EXAMPLE TO\nFUND SIGNIFICANT DISCRETIONARY ACTIVITIES, SUCH AS BUSINESS ACQUISITIONS AND SHARE REPURCHASES, WE COULD ELECT TO REPATRIATE FUTURE EARNINGS FROM FOREIGN JURISDICTIONS OR RAISE CAPITAL IN THE U.S. THROUGH DEBT OR EQUITY ISSUANCES. THESE ALTERNATIVES\nCOULD RESULT IN HIGHER EFFECTIVE TAX RATES, INCREASED INTEREST EXPENSE, OR DILUTION OF OUR EARNINGS. WE HAVE BORROWED FUNDS DOMESTICALLY AND CONTINUE TO BELIEVE WE HAVE THE ABILITY TO DO SO AT REASONABLE INTEREST RATES.\n45\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nPART II\nITEM 7\nRECENT ACCOUNTING GUIDANCE\nRECENTLY ADOPTED ACCOUNTING GUIDANCE\nIN DECEMBER 2011, THE FINANCIAL ACCOUNTING STANDARDS\nBOARD (\u0093FASB\u0094) ISSUED GUIDANCE ENHANCING DISCLOSURE REQUIREMENTS ABOUT THE NATURE OF AN ENTITY\u0092S RIGHT TO OFFSET AND RELATED ARRANGEMENTS ASSOCIATED WITH ITS FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS. THE NEW GUIDANCE REQUIRES THE DISCLOSURE OF THE GROSS\nAMOUNTS SUBJECT TO RIGHTS OF SET-OFF, AMOUNTS OFFSET IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE ACCOUNTING STANDARDS FOLLOWED, AND THE RELATED NET EXPOSURE. IN JANUARY 2013, THE FASB CLARIFIED THAT THE SCOPE OF THIS GUIDANCE APPLIES TO DERIVATIVES, REPURCHASE\nAGREEMENTS, AND SECURITIES LENDING ARRANGEMENTS THAT ARE EITHER OFFSET OR SUBJECT TO AN ENFORCEABLE MASTER NETTING ARRANGEMENT, OR SIMILAR AGREEMENTS. WE ADOPTED THIS NEW GUIDANCE BEGINNING JULY 1, 2013. ADOPTION OF THIS NEW GUIDANCE RESULTED\nONLY IN CHANGES TO THE PRESENTATION OF NOTE 5 \u0096 DERIVATIVES OF THE NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.\nIN FEBRUARY 2013, THE FASB\nISSUED GUIDANCE ON DISCLOSURE REQUIREMENTS FOR ITEMS RECLASSIFIED OUT OF AOCI. THIS NEW GUIDANCE REQUIRES ENTITIES TO PRESENT (EITHER ON THE FACE OF THE INCOME STATEMENT OR IN THE NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS) THE EFFECTS ON THE LINE ITEMS OF THE\nINCOME STATEMENT FOR AMOUNTS RECLASSIFIED OUT OF AOCI. WE ADOPTED THIS NEW GUIDANCE BEGINNING JULY 1, 2013. ADOPTION OF THIS NEW GUIDANCE RESULTED ONLY IN CHANGES TO THE PRESENTATION OF NOTE 19 \u0096 ACCUMULATED OTHER COMPREHENSIVE INCOME OF\nTHE NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.\nRECENT ACCOUNTING GUIDANCE NOT YET ADOPTED\nIN MARCH 2013, THE FASB ISSUED GUIDANCE ON A PARENT\u0092S ACCOUNTING FOR THE CUMULATIVE TRANSLATION ADJUSTMENT UPON DERECOGNITION OF A SUBSIDIARY\nOR GROUP OF ASSETS WITHIN A FOREIGN ENTITY. THIS NEW GUIDANCE REQUIRES THAT THE PARENT RELEASE ANY RELATED CUMULATIVE TRANSLATION ADJUSTMENT INTO NET INCOME ONLY IF THE SALE OR TRANSFER RESULTS IN THE COMPLETE OR SUBSTANTIALLY COMPLETE LIQUIDATION\nOF THE FOREIGN ENTITY IN WHICH THE SUBSIDIARY OR GROUP OF ASSETS HAD RESIDED. THE NEW GUIDANCE WILL BE EFFECTIVE FOR US BEGINNING JULY 1, 2014. WE DO NOT ANTICIPATE MATERIAL IMPACTS ON OUR CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS UPON ADOPTION.\nIN MAY 2014, AS PART OF ITS ONGOING EFFORTS TO ASSIST IN THE CONVERGENCE OF U.S. GAAP AND INTERNATIONAL FINANCIAL REPORTING STANDARDS,\nTHE FASB ISSUED A NEW STANDARD RELATED TO REVENUE RECOGNITION. UNDER THE NEW STANDARD, RECOGNITION OF REVENUE OCCURS WHEN A CUSTOMER OBTAINS CONTROL OF PROMISED GOODS OR SERVICES IN AN AMOUNT THAT REFLECTS THE CONSIDERATION TO WHICH THE ENTITY\nEXPECTS TO RECEIVE IN EXCHANGE FOR THOSE GOODS OR SERVICES. IN ADDITION, THE STANDARD REQUIRES DISCLOSURE OF THE NATURE, AMOUNT, TIMING, AND UNCERTAINTY OF REVENUE AND CASH FLOWS ARISING FROM CONTRACTS WITH CUSTOMERS. THE NEW STANDARD WILL BE\nEFFECTIVE FOR US BEGINNING JULY 1, 2017 AND EARLY ADOPTION IS NOT PERMITTED. WE ANTICIPATE THIS STANDARD WILL HAVE A MATERIAL IMPACT ON OUR CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS, AND WE ARE CURRENTLY EVALUATING ITS IMPACT.\nAPPLICATION OF CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES\nOUR CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND ACCOMPANYING NOTES ARE PREPARED IN ACCORDANCE WITH U.S. GAAP. PREPARING CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS REQUIRES MANAGEMENT TO MAKE ESTIMATES AND ASSUMPTIONS THAT AFFECT\nTHE REPORTED AMOUNTS OF ASSETS, LIABILITIES, REVENUE, AND EXPENSES. THESE ESTIMATES AND ASSUMPTIONS ARE AFFECTED BY MANAGEMENT\u0092S APPLICATION OF ACCOUNTING POLICIES. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES FOR US INCLUDE REVENUE RECOGNITION, IMPAIRMENT OF\nINVESTMENT SECURITIES, GOODWILL, RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT COSTS, CONTINGENCIES, INCOME TAXES, AND INVENTORIES.\nREVENUE RECOGNITION\nREVENUE RECOGNITION FOR MULTIPLE-ELEMENT ARRANGEMENTS REQUIRES JUDGMENT TO DETERMINE IF MULTIPLE ELEMENTS EXIST, WHETHER ELEMENTS CAN BE ACCOUNTED\nFOR AS SEPARATE UNITS OF ACCOUNTING, AND IF SO, THE FAIR VALUE FOR EACH OF THE ELEMENTS.\nJUDGMENT IS ALSO REQUIRED TO ASSESS WHETHER\nFUTURE RELEASES OF CERTAIN SOFTWARE REPRESENT NEW PRODUCTS OR UPGRADES AND ENHANCEMENTS TO EXISTING PRODUCTS. CERTAIN VOLUME LICENSING ARRANGEMENTS INCLUDE A PERPETUAL LICENSE FOR\n46\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nPART II\nITEM 7\nCURRENT PRODUCTS COMBINED WITH RIGHTS TO RECEIVE UNSPECIFIED FUTURE VERSIONS OF SOFTWARE PRODUCTS (\u0093SOFTWARE ASSURANCE\u0094) AND ARE ACCOUNTED FOR AS SUBSCRIPTIONS, WITH BILLINGS RECORDED\nAS UNEARNED REVENUE AND RECOGNIZED AS REVENUE RATABLY OVER THE COVERAGE PERIOD.\nSOFTWARE UPDATES ARE EVALUATED ON A CASE-BY-CASE BASIS\nTO DETERMINE WHETHER THEY MEET THE DEFINITION OF AN UPGRADE, WHICH MAY REQUIRE REVENUE TO BE DEFERRED AND RECOGNIZED WHEN THE UPGRADE IS DELIVERED. IF IT IS DETERMINED THAT IMPLIED POST-CONTRACT CUSTOMER SUPPORT (\u0093PCS\u0094) IS BEING PROVIDED,\nREVENUE FROM THE ARRANGEMENT IS DEFERRED AND RECOGNIZED OVER THE IMPLIED PCS TERM. IF UPDATES ARE DETERMINED TO NOT MEET THE DEFINITION OF AN UPGRADE, REVENUE IS GENERALLY RECOGNIZED AS PRODUCTS ARE SHIPPED OR MADE AVAILABLE.\nMICROSOFT ENTERS INTO ARRANGEMENTS THAT CAN INCLUDE VARIOUS COMBINATIONS OF SOFTWARE, SERVICES, AND HARDWARE. WHERE ELEMENTS ARE DELIVERED OVER\nDIFFERENT PERIODS OF TIME, AND WHEN ALLOWED UNDER U.S. GAAP, REVENUE IS ALLOCATED TO THE RESPECTIVE ELEMENTS BASED ON THEIR RELATIVE SELLING PRICES AT THE INCEPTION OF THE ARRANGEMENT, AND REVENUE IS RECOGNIZED AS EACH ELEMENT IS DELIVERED. WE USE A\nHIERARCHY TO DETERMINE THE FAIR VALUE TO BE USED FOR ALLOCATING REVENUE TO ELEMENTS: (I) VENDOR-SPECIFIC OBJECTIVE EVIDENCE OF FAIR VALUE (\u0093VSOE\u0094), (II) THIRD-PARTY EVIDENCE, AND (III) BEST ESTIMATE OF SELLING PRICE\n(\u0093ESP\u0094). FOR SOFTWARE ELEMENTS, WE FOLLOW THE INDUSTRY SPECIFIC SOFTWARE GUIDANCE WHICH ONLY ALLOWS FOR THE USE OF VSOE IN ESTABLISHING FAIR VALUE. GENERALLY, VSOE IS THE PRICE CHARGED WHEN THE DELIVERABLE IS SOLD SEPARATELY OR THE PRICE\nESTABLISHED BY MANAGEMENT FOR A PRODUCT THAT IS NOT YET SOLD IF IT IS PROBABLE THAT THE PRICE WILL NOT CHANGE BEFORE INTRODUCTION INTO THE MARKETPLACE. ESPS ARE ESTABLISHED AS BEST ESTIMATES OF WHAT THE SELLING PRICES WOULD BE IF THE DELIVERABLES\nWERE SOLD REGULARLY ON A STAND-ALONE BASIS. OUR PROCESS FOR DETERMINING ESPS REQUIRES JUDGMENT AND CONSIDERS MULTIPLE FACTORS THAT MAY VARY OVER TIME DEPENDING UPON THE UNIQUE FACTS AND CIRCUMSTANCES RELATED TO EACH DELIVERABLE.\nWINDOWS 7 REVENUE WAS SUBJECT TO DEFERRAL AS A RESULT OF THE WINDOWS UPGRADE OFFER, WHICH STARTED JUNE 2, 2012. THE OFFER PROVIDED\nSIGNIFICANTLY DISCOUNTED RIGHTS TO PURCHASE WINDOWS 8 PRO TO QUALIFYING END-USERS THAT PURCHASED WINDOWS 7 PCS DURING THE ELIGIBILITY PERIOD. MICROSOFT WAS RESPONSIBLE FOR DELIVERING WINDOWS 8 PRO TO THE END CUSTOMER. ACCORDINGLY, REVENUE RELATED TO\nTHE ALLOCATED DISCOUNT FOR UNDELIVERED WINDOWS 8 WAS DEFERRED UNTIL IT WAS DELIVERED OR THE REDEMPTION PERIOD EXPIRED.\nIMPAIRMENT OF INVESTMENT\nSECURITIES\nWE REVIEW INVESTMENTS QUARTERLY FOR INDICATORS OF OTHER-THAN-TEMPORARY IMPAIRMENT. THIS DETERMINATION REQUIRES\nSIGNIFICANT JUDGMENT. IN MAKING THIS JUDGMENT, WE EMPLOY A SYSTEMATIC METHODOLOGY QUARTERLY THAT CONSIDERS AVAILABLE QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE EVIDENCE IN EVALUATING POTENTIAL IMPAIRMENT OF OUR INVESTMENTS. IF THE COST OF AN INVESTMENT EXCEEDS\nITS FAIR VALUE, WE EVALUATE, AMONG OTHER FACTORS, GENERAL MARKET CONDITIONS, CREDIT QUALITY OF DEBT INSTRUMENT ISSUERS, THE DURATION AND EXTENT TO WHICH THE FAIR VALUE IS LESS THAN COST, AND FOR EQUITY SECURITIES, OUR INTENT AND ABILITY TO HOLD, OR\nPLANS TO SELL, THE INVESTMENT. FOR FIXED-INCOME SECURITIES, WE ALSO EVALUATE WHETHER WE HAVE PLANS TO SELL THE SECURITY OR IT IS MORE LIKELY THAN NOT THAT WE WILL BE REQUIRED TO SELL THE SECURITY BEFORE RECOVERY. WE ALSO CONSIDER SPECIFIC ADVERSE\nCONDITIONS RELATED TO THE FINANCIAL HEALTH OF AND BUSINESS OUTLOOK FOR THE INVESTEE, INCLUDING INDUSTRY AND SECTOR PERFORMANCE, CHANGES IN TECHNOLOGY, AND OPERATIONAL AND FINANCING CASH FLOW FACTORS. ONCE A DECLINE IN FAIR VALUE IS DETERMINED TO BE\nOTHER-THAN-TEMPORARY, AN IMPAIRMENT CHARGE IS RECORDED TO OTHER INCOME (EXPENSE) AND A NEW COST BASIS IN THE INVESTMENT IS ESTABLISHED. IF MARKET, INDUSTRY, AND\/OR INVESTEE CONDITIONS DETERIORATE, WE MAY INCUR FUTURE IMPAIRMENTS.\nGOODWILL\nWE ALLOCATE GOODWILL TO REPORTING\nUNITS BASED ON THE REPORTING UNIT EXPECTED TO BENEFIT FROM THE BUSINESS COMBINATION. WE EVALUATE OUR REPORTING UNITS ON AN ANNUAL BASIS AND, IF NECESSARY, REASSIGN GOODWILL USING A RELATIVE FAIR VALUE ALLOCATION APPROACH. GOODWILL IS TESTED FOR\nIMPAIRMENT AT THE REPORTING UNIT LEVEL (OPERATING SEGMENT OR ONE LEVEL BELOW AN OPERATING SEGMENT) ON AN ANNUAL BASIS (MAY 1 FOR US) AND BETWEEN ANNUAL TESTS IF AN EVENT OCCURS OR CIRCUMSTANCES CHANGE THAT WOULD MORE LIKELY THAN NOT REDUCE THE FAIR\nVALUE OF A REPORTING UNIT BELOW ITS CARRYING VALUE. THESE EVENTS OR CIRCUMSTANCES COULD INCLUDE A SIGNIFICANT CHANGE IN THE BUSINESS CLIMATE, LEGAL FACTORS, OPERATING PERFORMANCE INDICATORS, COMPETITION, OR SALE OR DISPOSITION OF A SIGNIFICANT\nPORTION OF A REPORTING UNIT.\n47\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nPART II\nITEM 7\nAPPLICATION OF THE GOODWILL IMPAIRMENT TEST REQUIRES JUDGMENT, INCLUDING THE IDENTIFICATION OF\nREPORTING UNITS, ASSIGNMENT OF ASSETS AND LIABILITIES TO REPORTING UNITS, ASSIGNMENT OF GOODWILL TO REPORTING UNITS, AND DETERMINATION OF THE FAIR VALUE OF EACH REPORTING UNIT. THE FAIR VALUE OF EACH REPORTING UNIT IS ESTIMATED PRIMARILY THROUGH THE\nUSE OF A DISCOUNTED CASH FLOW METHODOLOGY. THIS ANALYSIS REQUIRES SIGNIFICANT JUDGMENTS, INCLUDING ESTIMATION OF FUTURE CASH FLOWS, WHICH IS DEPENDENT ON INTERNAL FORECASTS, ESTIMATION OF THE LONG-TERM RATE OF GROWTH FOR OUR BUSINESS, ESTIMATION OF\nTHE USEFUL LIFE OVER WHICH CASH FLOWS WILL OCCUR, AND DETERMINATION OF OUR WEIGHTED AVERAGE COST OF CAPITAL.\nTHE ESTIMATES USED TO\nCALCULATE THE FAIR VALUE OF A REPORTING UNIT CHANGE FROM YEAR TO YEAR BASED ON OPERATING RESULTS, MARKET CONDITIONS, AND OTHER FACTORS. CHANGES IN THESE ESTIMATES AND ASSUMPTIONS COULD MATERIALLY AFFECT THE DETERMINATION OF FAIR VALUE AND GOODWILL\nIMPAIRMENT FOR EACH REPORTING UNIT.\nTHE VALUATION OF ACQUIRED ASSETS AND LIABILITIES, INCLUDING GOODWILL, RESULTING FROM THE\nACQUISITION OF NDS, IS REFLECTIVE OF THE ENTERPRISE VALUE BASED ON THE LONG-TERM FINANCIAL FORECAST FOR THE BUSINESS. IN THIS HIGHLY COMPETITIVE AND VOLATILE MARKET, IT IS POSSIBLE THAT WE MAY NOT REALIZE OUR FORECASTS. GIVEN THE VALUE ASSIGNED\nTO GOODWILL IN THE PURCHASE PRICE ALLOCATION, WE WILL CLOSELY MONITOR THE PERFORMANCE OF THE BUSINESS VERSUS THE LONG-TERM FORECAST TO DETERMINE IF ANY IMPAIRMENTS ARISE.\nRESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT COSTS\nCOSTS INCURRED INTERNALLY IN RESEARCHING AND DEVELOPING A\nCOMPUTER SOFTWARE PRODUCT ARE CHARGED TO EXPENSE UNTIL TECHNOLOGICAL FEASIBILITY HAS BEEN ESTABLISHED FOR THE PRODUCT. ONCE TECHNOLOGICAL FEASIBILITY IS ESTABLISHED, ALL SOFTWARE COSTS ARE CAPITALIZED UNTIL THE PRODUCT IS AVAILABLE FOR GENERAL\nRELEASE TO CUSTOMERS. JUDGMENT IS REQUIRED IN DETERMINING WHEN TECHNOLOGICAL FEASIBILITY OF A PRODUCT IS ESTABLISHED. WE HAVE DETERMINED THAT TECHNOLOGICAL FEASIBILITY FOR OUR SOFTWARE PRODUCTS IS REACHED AFTER ALL HIGH-RISK DEVELOPMENT ISSUES HAVE\nBEEN RESOLVED THROUGH CODING AND TESTING. GENERALLY, THIS OCCURS SHORTLY BEFORE THE PRODUCTS ARE RELEASED TO MANUFACTURING. THE AMORTIZATION OF THESE COSTS IS INCLUDED IN COST OF REVENUE OVER THE ESTIMATED LIFE OF THE PRODUCTS.\nLEGAL AND OTHER CONTINGENCIES\nTHE OUTCOMES\nOF LEGAL PROCEEDINGS AND CLAIMS BROUGHT AGAINST US ARE SUBJECT TO SIGNIFICANT UNCERTAINTY. AN ESTIMATED LOSS FROM A LOSS CONTINGENCY SUCH AS A LEGAL PROCEEDING OR CLAIM IS ACCRUED BY A CHARGE TO INCOME IF IT IS PROBABLE THAT AN ASSET HAS BEEN\nIMPAIRED OR A LIABILITY HAS BEEN INCURRED AND THE AMOUNT OF THE LOSS CAN BE REASONABLY ESTIMATED. IN DETERMINING WHETHER A LOSS SHOULD BE ACCRUED WE EVALUATE, AMONG OTHER FACTORS, THE DEGREE OF PROBABILITY OF AN UNFAVORABLE OUTCOME AND THE ABILITY\nTO MAKE A REASONABLE ESTIMATE OF THE AMOUNT OF LOSS. CHANGES IN THESE FACTORS COULD MATERIALLY IMPACT OUR CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.\nINCOME\nTAXES\nTHE OBJECTIVES OF ACCOUNTING FOR INCOME TAXES ARE TO RECOGNIZE THE AMOUNT OF TAXES PAYABLE OR REFUNDABLE FOR THE CURRENT YEAR\nAND DEFERRED TAX LIABILITIES AND ASSETS FOR THE FUTURE TAX CONSEQUENCES OF EVENTS THAT HAVE BEEN RECOGNIZED IN AN ENTITY\u0092S FINANCIAL STATEMENTS OR TAX RETURNS. WE RECOGNIZE THE TAX BENEFIT FROM AN UNCERTAIN TAX POSITION ONLY IF IT IS MORE\nLIKELY THAN NOT THAT THE TAX POSITION WILL BE SUSTAINED ON EXAMINATION BY THE TAXING AUTHORITIES, BASED ON THE TECHNICAL MERITS OF THE POSITION. THE TAX BENEFITS RECOGNIZED IN THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FROM SUCH A POSITION ARE MEASURED BASED ON THE\nLARGEST BENEFIT THAT HAS A GREATER THAN 50% LIKELIHOOD OF BEING REALIZED UPON ULTIMATE SETTLEMENT. ACCOUNTING LITERATURE ALSO PROVIDES GUIDANCE ON DERECOGNITION OF INCOME TAX ASSETS AND LIABILITIES, CLASSIFICATION OF CURRENT AND DEFERRED INCOME TAX\nASSETS AND LIABILITIES, ACCOUNTING FOR INTEREST AND PENALTIES ASSOCIATED WITH TAX POSITIONS, AND INCOME TAX DISCLOSURES. JUDGMENT IS REQUIRED IN ASSESSING THE FUTURE TAX CONSEQUENCES OF EVENTS THAT HAVE BEEN RECOGNIZED IN OUR CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL\nSTATEMENTS OR TAX RETURNS. VARIATIONS IN THE ACTUAL OUTCOME OF THESE FUTURE TAX CONSEQUENCES COULD MATERIALLY IMPACT OUR CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.\nINVENTORIES\nINVENTORIES ARE STATED AT AVERAGE COST, SUBJECT TO THE LOWER OF COST OR MARKET.\nCOST INCLUDES MATERIALS, LABOR, AND MANUFACTURING OVERHEAD RELATED TO THE PURCHASE AND PRODUCTION OF INVENTORIES. WE REGULARLY REVIEW INVENTORY\n48\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nPART II\nITEM 7\nQUANTITIES ON HAND, FUTURE PURCHASE COMMITMENTS WITH OUR SUPPLIERS, AND THE ESTIMATED UTILITY OF OUR INVENTORY. THESE REVIEWS INCLUDE ANALYSIS OF DEMAND FORECASTS, PRODUCT LIFE CYCLE STATUS,\nPRODUCT DEVELOPMENT PLANS, CURRENT SALES LEVELS, PRICING STRATEGY, AND COMPONENT COST TRENDS. IF OUR REVIEW INDICATES A REDUCTION IN UTILITY BELOW CARRYING VALUE, WE REDUCE OUR INVENTORY TO A NEW COST BASIS THROUGH A CHARGE TO COST OF REVENUE. THE\nDETERMINATION OF MARKET VALUE AND THE ESTIMATED VOLUME OF DEMAND USED IN THE LOWER OF COST OR MARKET ANALYSIS REQUIRE SIGNIFICANT JUDGMENT.\n49\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nPART II\nITEM 7\nSTATEMENT OF MANAGEMENT\u0092S RESPONSIBILITY FOR FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nMANAGEMENT IS RESPONSIBLE FOR THE PREPARATION OF THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND RELATED INFORMATION THAT ARE PRESENTED IN THIS REPORT.\nTHE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS, WHICH INCLUDE AMOUNTS BASED ON MANAGEMENT\u0092S ESTIMATES AND JUDGMENTS, HAVE BEEN PREPARED IN CONFORMITY WITH ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES GENERALLY ACCEPTED IN THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA.\nTHE COMPANY DESIGNS AND MAINTAINS ACCOUNTING AND INTERNAL CONTROL SYSTEMS TO PROVIDE REASONABLE ASSURANCE AT REASONABLE COST THAT ASSETS ARE\nSAFEGUARDED AGAINST LOSS FROM UNAUTHORIZED USE OR DISPOSITION, AND THAT THE FINANCIAL RECORDS ARE RELIABLE FOR PREPARING CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND MAINTAINING ACCOUNTABILITY FOR ASSETS. THESE SYSTEMS ARE AUGMENTED BY WRITTEN POLICIES, AN\nORGANIZATIONAL STRUCTURE PROVIDING DIVISION OF RESPONSIBILITIES, CAREFUL SELECTION AND TRAINING OF QUALIFIED PERSONNEL, AND A PROGRAM OF INTERNAL AUDITS.\nTHE COMPANY ENGAGED DELOITTE & TOUCHE LLP, AN INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM, TO AUDIT AND RENDER AN OPINION ON THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL\nREPORTING IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE STANDARDS OF THE PUBLIC COMPANY ACCOUNTING OVERSIGHT BOARD (UNITED STATES).\nTHE BOARD OF DIRECTORS,\nTHROUGH ITS AUDIT COMMITTEE, CONSISTING SOLELY OF INDEPENDENT DIRECTORS OF THE COMPANY, MEETS PERIODICALLY WITH MANAGEMENT, INTERNAL AUDITORS, AND OUR INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM TO ENSURE THAT EACH IS MEETING ITS RESPONSIBILITIES\nAND TO DISCUSS MATTERS CONCERNING INTERNAL CONTROLS AND FINANCIAL REPORTING.

THE COMPANY\nSELLS ITS PRODUCTS WORLDWIDE THROUGH ITS RETAIL STORES, ONLINE STORES AND DIRECT SALES FORCE, AS WELL AS THROUGH THIRD-PARTY CELLULAR NETWORK CARRIERS, WHOLESALERS, RETAILERS AND VALUE-ADDED RESELLERS. IN ADDITION, THE COMPANY SELLS A VARIETY OF\nTHIRD-PARTY IPHONE, IPAD, MAC AND IPOD COMPATIBLE PRODUCTS, INCLUDING APPLICATION SOFTWARE, AND VARIOUS ACCESSORIES THROUGH ITS ONLINE AND RETAIL STORES. THE COMPANY SELLS TO CONSUMERS; SMALL AND MID-SIZED BUSINESSES; AND EDUCATION, ENTERPRISE AND\nGOVERNMENT CUSTOMERS.\nFISCAL 2014 HIGHLIGHTS\nNET SALES\nROSE 7% OR $11.9 BILLION DURING 2014 COMPARED TO 2013. THIS WAS DRIVEN BY INCREASES IN NET SALES OF IPHONE; MAC; ITUNES, SOFTWARE AND SERVICES; AND ACCESSORIES. NET SALES AND UNIT SALES INCREASED FOR IPHONE PRIMARILY DUE TO THE SUCCESSFUL\nINTRODUCTION OF IPHONE 5S AND 5C IN THE LATTER HALF OF CALENDAR YEAR 2013, THE SUCCESSFUL LAUNCH OF IPHONE 6 AND 6 PLUS BEGINNING IN THE FOURTH QUARTER OF 2014, AND EXPANDED DISTRIBUTION. MAC NET SALES AND UNIT SALES INCREASED PRIMARILY DUE TO\nSTRONG DEMAND FOR MACBOOK AIR AND MACBOOK PRO WHICH WERE UPDATED IN 2014 WITH FASTER PROCESSORS AND OFFERED AT LOWER PRICES. NET SALES OF ITUNES, SOFTWARE AND SERVICES GREW PRIMARILY DUE TO INCREASED REVENUE FROM SALES THROUGH THE APP STORE,\nAPPLECARE AND LICENSING. NET SALES AND UNIT SALES FOR IPAD DECLINED IN 2014 COMPARED TO 2013 DUE TO LOWER UNIT SALES IN MANY MARKETS. GROWTH IN TOTAL NET SALES DURING 2014 WAS ALSO NEGATIVELY IMPACTED BY THE CONTINUING DECLINE OF IPOD SALES. ALL OF\nTHE COMPANY\u2019S OPERATING SEGMENTS OTHER THAN THE REST OF ASIA PACIFIC SEGMENT EXPERIENCED INCREASED NET SALES IN 2014, WITH GROWTH BEING STRONGEST IN THE GREATER CHINA AND JAPAN OPERATING SEGMENTS.\nDURING THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2014, THE COMPANY INTRODUCED IPAD AIR, ITS FIFTH GENERATION IPAD AND IPAD MINI WITH RETINA DISPLAY. AT ITS WORLDWIDE\nDEVELOPER CONFERENCE IN JUNE 2014, THE COMPANY ANNOUNCED IOS 8 AND OS X YOSEMITE. IN SEPTEMBER 2014, THE COMPANY INTRODUCED IPHONE 6 AND 6 PLUS, RELEASED IOS 8, ANNOUNCED APPLE PAY, WHICH BECAME AVAILABLE IN THE U.S. IN OCTOBER 2014, AND PREVIEWED\nAPPLE WATCH, WHICH IS EXPECTED TO BE AVAILABLE IN EARLY CALENDAR 2015. IN OCTOBER 2014, THE COMPANY INTRODUCED IPAD AIR 2, IPAD MINI 3, IMAC WITH RETINA 5K DISPLAY AND AN UPDATED MAC MINI; AND RELEASED OS X YOSEMITE.\nDURING 2014, THE COMPANY COMPLETED VARIOUS BUSINESS ACQUISITIONS, INCLUDING THE ACQUISITIONS OF BEATS MUSIC, LLC, WHICH OFFERS A SUBSCRIPTION STREAMING\nMUSIC SERVICE, AND BEATS ELECTRONICS, LLC, WHICH MAKES BEATS HEADPHONES, SPEAKERS AND AUDIO SOFTWARE.\nAPPLE INC. | 2014 FORM 10-K | 25\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nIN APRIL 2014, THE COMPANY INCREASED ITS SHARE REPURCHASE AUTHORIZATION TO $90 BILLION AND THE QUARTERLY\nDIVIDEND WAS RAISED TO $0.47 PER COMMON SHARE, RESULTING IN AN OVERALL INCREASE IN ITS CAPITAL RETURN PROGRAM FROM $100 BILLION TO OVER $130 BILLION. DURING 2014, THE COMPANY UTILIZED $45 BILLION TO REPURCHASE ITS COMMON STOCK AND PAID\nDIVIDENDS AND DIVIDEND EQUIVALENTS OF $11.1 BILLION. THE CURRENT SHARE REPURCHASE PROGRAM IS EXPECTED TO BE COMPLETED BY THE END OF DECEMBER 2015. THE COMPANY ALSO ISSUED $12.0 BILLION OF LONG-TERM DEBT DURING 2014 WITH VARYING MATURITIES THROUGH\n2044 AND LAUNCHED A COMMERCIAL PAPER PROGRAM, WITH $6.3 BILLION OUTSTANDING AS OF SEPTEMBER 27, 2014.\nFISCAL 2013 HIGHLIGHTS\nNET SALES ROSE 9% OR $14.4 BILLION DURING 2013 COMPARED TO 2012. THIS RESULTED FROM GROWTH IN NET SALES OF IPHONE; ITUNES, SOFTWARE AND SERVICES; AND\nIPAD. GROWTH IN 2013 REFLECTED STRONG SALES OF IPHONE 5, STRONG CONTINUING SALES OF IPHONE 4 AND 4S, THE INTRODUCTION OF IPHONE 5C AND 5S, STRONG PERFORMANCE OF THE IPAD MINI AND FOURTH GENERATION IPAD, AND CONTINUED GROWTH IN THE COMPANY\u2019S\nONLINE SALES OF APPS, DIGITAL CONTENT AND SERVICES. GROWTH IN THESE AREAS WAS PARTIALLY OFFSET BY DECLINES IN NET SALES OF MAC AND IPOD. ALL OF THE COMPANY\u2019S OPERATING SEGMENTS EXPERIENCED INCREASED NET SALES IN 2013, WITH NET SALES GROWTH\nBEING PARTICULARLY STRONG IN THE AMERICAS, GREATER CHINA AND JAPAN OPERATING SEGMENTS. GROWTH IN TOTAL NET SALES WAS HIGHER DURING THE FIRST HALF OF 2013, RISING $12.6 BILLION OR 14.7% OVER THE SAME PERIOD IN 2012. FIRST HALF GROWTH IN 2013 WAS\nDRIVEN BY IPHONE AND IPAD INTRODUCTIONS AT OR NEAR THE BEGINNING OF 2013.\nDURING THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2013, THE COMPANY INTRODUCED THE FOURTH\nGENERATION IPAD AND IPAD MINI, A NEW MACBOOK PRO WITH RETINA DISPLAY, A NEW IPOD TOUCH, A NEW IMAC, AND EXPANDED THE ROLLOUT OF IPHONE 5 WHICH BEGAN IN SEPTEMBER 2012. IN JUNE 2013 AT ITS WORLDWIDE DEVELOPER CONFERENCE, THE COMPANY ANNOUNCED IOS 7\nAND OS X MAVERICKS, ANNOUNCED ITUNES RADIO, INTRODUCED A SIGNIFICANT UPGRADE TO MACBOOK AIR, AND PROVIDED A PREVIEW OF ALL NEW MAC PRO DESKTOPS THAT WERE INTRODUCED DURING 2014.

THIS INCLUDED INCREASING ITS SHARE REPURCHASE AUTHORIZATION TO $60 BILLION AND RAISING ITS QUARTERLY DIVIDEND TO $0.44 PER COMMON SHARE BEGINNING IN MAY 2013. DURING 2013, THE COMPANY\nUTILIZED $23.0 BILLION TO REPURCHASE COMMON SHARES AND PAID DIVIDENDS OF $10.5 BILLION OR $1.64 PER COMMON SHARE. IN CONJUNCTION WITH ITS CAPITAL RETURN PROGRAM, IN MAY 2013 THE COMPANY ISSUED $17.0 BILLION OF LONG-TERM DEBT WITH VARYING MATURITIES\nTHROUGH 2043.\nAPPLE INC. | 2014 FORM 10-K | 26\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nSALES DATA\nTHE\nFOLLOWING TABLE SHOWS NET SALES BY OPERATING SEGMENT AND NET SALES AND UNIT SALES BY PRODUCT DURING 2014, 2013 AND 2012 (DOLLARS IN MILLIONS AND UNITS IN THOUSANDS).\n2014\nCHANGE\n2013\nCHANGE\n2012\nNET SALES BY OPERATING SEGMENT.\nAMERICAS\n$65,232\n4%\n$62,739\n9%\n$57,512\nEUROPE\n40,929\n8%\n37,883\n4%\n36,323\nGREATER CHINA\n29,846\n17%\n25,417\n13%\n22,533\nJAPAN\n14,982\n11%\n13,462\n27%\n10,571\nREST OF ASIA PACIFIC\n10,344\n(7\n)%\n11,181\n4%\n10,741\nRETAIL\n21,462\n6%\n20,228\n7%\n18,828\nTOTAL NET SALES\n$182,795\n7%\n$170,910\n9%\n$156,508\nNET SALES BY PRODUCT.\nIPHONE\n(1)\n$101,991\n12%\n$91,279\n16%\n$78,692\nIPAD\n(1)\n30,283\n(5\n)%\n31,980\n3%\n30,945\nMAC\n(1)\n24,079\n12%\n21,483\n(7\n)%\n23,221\nIPOD\n(1)\n2,286\n(48\n)%\n4,411\n(21\n)%\n5,615\nITUNES, SOFTWARE AND SERVICES\n(2)\n18,063\n13%\n16,051\n25%\n12,890\nACCESSORIES\n(3)\n6,093\n7%\n5,706\n11%\n5,145\nTOTAL NET SALES\n$182,795\n7%\n$170,910\n9%\n$156,508\nUNIT SALES BY PRODUCT.\nIPHONE\n169,219\n13%\n150,257\n20%\n125,046\nIPAD\n67,977\n(4\n)%\n71,033\n22%\n58,310\nMAC\n18,906\n16%\n16,341\n(10\n)%\n18,158\nIPOD\n14,377\n(45\n)%\n26,379\n(25\n)%\n35,165\n(1)\nINCLUDES DEFERRALS AND AMORTIZATION OF RELATED NON-SOFTWARE SERVICES AND SOFTWARE UPGRADE RIGHTS.\n(2)\nINCLUDES REVENUE FROM THE ITUNES STORE, THE APP STORE, THE MAC APP STORE, THE IBOOKS STORE, APPLECARE,\nLICENSING AND OTHER SERVICES.\n(3)\nINCLUDES SALES OF APPLE-BRANDED AND THIRD-PARTY ACCESSORIES FOR IPHONE, IPAD, MAC AND IPOD.\nTHE COMPANY\u2019S FISCAL YEAR IS THE 52 OR 53-WEEK PERIOD THAT ENDS ON THE LAST SATURDAY OF\nSEPTEMBER.

ALL OF THE COMPANY\u2019S OPERATING SEGMENTS EXPERIENCED\nINCREASES IN NET SALES AND UNIT SALES OF IPHONE DURING 2013 COMPARED TO 2012. THE YEAR-OVER-YEAR IMPACT OF HIGHER IPHONE UNIT SALES IN 2013 WAS PARTIALLY OFFSET BY A 3% DECLINE IN IPHONE ASPS PRIMARILY AS A RESULT OF A SHIFT IN PRODUCT MIX TOWARDS\nLOWER-PRICED IPHONE MODELS, PARTICULARLY IPHONE 4.

OVERALL IPAD ASPS WERE RELATIVELY FLAT IN 2014 COMPARED TO 2013 WITH A SHIFT IN MIX TO HIGHER-PRICED IPADS BEING OFFSET BY THE OCTOBER 2013 PRICE\nREDUCTION OF IPAD MINI. ASPS INCREASED IN THE JAPAN AND RETAIL SEGMENTS BUT WERE FLAT TO SLIGHTLY DOWN IN OTHER SEGMENTS.\nTHE GROWTH IN NET SALES\nAND UNIT SALES OF IPAD DURING 2013 RESULTED FROM GROWTH IN IPAD UNIT SALES IN ALL OF THE COMPANY\u2019S OPERATING SEGMENTS. THIS GROWTH WAS DRIVEN BY THE LAUNCH OF IPAD MINI AND THE FOURTH GENERATION IPAD BEGINNING IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2013. THE\nYEAR-OVER-YEAR GROWTH RATE OF TOTAL IPAD UNIT SALES WAS SIGNIFICANTLY HIGHER THAN THE GROWTH RATE OF TOTAL IPAD NET SALES FOR 2013 DUE TO A REDUCTION IN IPAD ASPS OF 15% IN 2013 COMPARED TO 2012. THIS DECLINE RESULTED PRIMARILY FROM INTRODUCTION OF\nTHE LOWER PRICED IPAD MINI AND THE FULL YEAR IMPACT OF THE PRICE REDUCTION ON IPAD 2 MADE IN 2012.

THESE OUTSOURCING PARTNERS ACQUIRE COMPONENTS AND BUILD PRODUCT BASED ON DEMAND INFORMATION SUPPLIED BY THE COMPANY, WHICH TYPICALLY COVERS PERIODS UP TO 150 DAYS. THE COMPANY ALSO OBTAINS INDIVIDUAL COMPONENTS FOR ITS PRODUCTS\nFROM A WIDE VARIETY OF INDIVIDUAL SUPPLIERS. CONSISTENT WITH INDUSTRY PRACTICE, THE COMPANY ACQUIRES COMPONENTS THROUGH A COMBINATION OF PURCHASE ORDERS, SUPPLIER CONTRACTS AND OPEN ORDERS BASED ON PROJECTED DEMAND INFORMATION. WHERE\nAPPROPRIATE, THE PURCHASES ARE APPLIED TO INVENTORY COMPONENT PREPAYMENTS THAT ARE OUTSTANDING WITH THE RESPECTIVE SUPPLIER.\nOTHER\nOBLIGATIONS\nTHE COMPANY\u2019S OTHER OBLIGATIONS WERE COMPRISED MAINLY OF COMMITMENTS TO ACQUIRE CAPITAL ASSETS, INCLUDING PRODUCT TOOLING AND\nMANUFACTURING PROCESS EQUIPMENT AND COMMITMENTS RELATED TO ADVERTISING, R&D, INTERNET AND TELECOMMUNICATIONS SERVICES AND OTHER OBLIGATIONS.\nTHE\nCOMPANY\u2019S OTHER NON-CURRENT LIABILITIES IN THE CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS CONSIST PRIMARILY OF DEFERRED TAX LIABILITIES, GROSS UNRECOGNIZED TAX BENEFITS AND THE RELATED GROSS INTEREST AND PENALTIES.

ADDITIONALLY, AS OF SEPTEMBER 27, 2014, THE COMPANY HAD GROSS UNRECOGNIZED TAX BENEFITS OF $4.0 BILLION AND AN ADDITIONAL $630 MILLION FOR GROSS INTEREST AND PENALTIES CLASSIFIED AS\nNON-CURRENT LIABILITIES. AT THIS TIME, THE COMPANY IS UNABLE TO MAKE A REASONABLY RELIABLE ESTIMATE OF THE TIMING OF PAYMENTS IN INDIVIDUAL YEARS IN CONNECTION WITH THESE TAX LIABILITIES; THEREFORE, SUCH AMOUNTS ARE NOT INCLUDED IN THE ABOVE\nCONTRACTUAL OBLIGATION TABLE.\nINDEMNIFICATION\nTHE COMPANY\nGENERALLY DOES NOT INDEMNIFY END-USERS OF ITS OPERATING SYSTEM AND APPLICATION SOFTWARE AGAINST LEGAL CLAIMS THAT THE SOFTWARE INFRINGES THIRD-PARTY INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS. OTHER AGREEMENTS ENTERED INTO BY THE COMPANY SOMETIMES INCLUDE\nINDEMNIFICATION PROVISIONS UNDER WHICH THE COMPANY COULD BE SUBJECT TO COSTS AND\/OR DAMAGES IN THE EVENT OF AN INFRINGEMENT CLAIM AGAINST THE COMPANY OR AN INDEMNIFIED THIRD-PARTY. HOWEVER, THE COMPANY HAS NOT BEEN REQUIRED TO MAKE ANY SIGNIFICANT\nPAYMENTS RESULTING FROM SUCH AN INFRINGEMENT CLAIM ASSERTED AGAINST IT OR AN INDEMNIFIED THIRD-PARTY. IN THE OPINION OF MANAGEMENT, THERE WAS NOT AT LEAST A REASONABLE POSSIBILITY THE COMPANY MAY HAVE INCURRED A MATERIAL LOSS WITH RESPECT TO\nINDEMNIFICATION OF END-USERS OF ITS OPERATING SYSTEM OR APPLICATION SOFTWARE FOR INFRINGEMENT OF THIRD-PARTY INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS. THE COMPANY DID NOT RECORD A LIABILITY FOR INFRINGEMENT COSTS RELATED TO INDEMNIFICATION AS OF\nSEPTEMBER 27, 2014 OR SEPTEMBER 28, 2013.\nTHE COMPANY HAS ENTERED INTO INDEMNIFICATION AGREEMENTS WITH ITS DIRECTORS AND EXECUTIVE\nOFFICERS.

IT IS NOT POSSIBLE TO DETERMINE THE MAXIMUM POTENTIAL AMOUNT OF PAYMENTS THE COMPANY COULD BE REQUIRED TO MAKE UNDER THESE AGREEMENTS DUE TO THE LIMITED HISTORY OF PRIOR INDEMNIFICATION\nCLAIMS AND THE UNIQUE FACTS AND CIRCUMSTANCES INVOLVED IN EACH CLAIM. HOWEVER, THE COMPANY MAINTAINS DIRECTORS AND OFFICERS LIABILITY INSURANCE COVERAGE TO REDUCE ITS EXPOSURE TO SUCH OBLIGATIONS AND PAYMENTS MADE UNDER THESE AGREEMENTS HISTORICALLY\nHAVE NOT BEEN MATERIAL.\nAPPLE INC. | 2014 FORM 10-K | 38\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nCRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES\nTHE PREPARATION OF FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND RELATED DISCLOSURES IN CONFORMITY WITH U.S. GENERALLY ACCEPTED ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES (\u201cGAAP\u201d) AND\nTHE COMPANY\u2019S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF ITS FINANCIAL CONDITION AND OPERATING RESULTS REQUIRE THE COMPANY\u2019S MANAGEMENT TO MAKE JUDGMENTS, ASSUMPTIONS AND ESTIMATES THAT AFFECT THE AMOUNTS REPORTED IN ITS CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nAND ACCOMPANYING NOTES. NOTE 1, \u201cSUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES\u201d OF THE NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS IN PART II, ITEM 8 OF THIS FORM 10-K DESCRIBES THE SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND METHODS USED IN\nTHE PREPARATION OF THE COMPANY\u2019S CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS. MANAGEMENT BASES ITS ESTIMATES ON HISTORICAL EXPERIENCE AND ON VARIOUS OTHER ASSUMPTIONS IT BELIEVES TO BE REASONABLE UNDER THE CIRCUMSTANCES, THE RESULTS OF WHICH FORM THE\nBASIS FOR MAKING JUDGMENTS ABOUT THE CARRYING VALUES OF ASSETS AND LIABILITIES. ACTUAL RESULTS MAY DIFFER FROM THESE ESTIMATES AND SUCH DIFFERENCES MAY BE MATERIAL.\nMANAGEMENT BELIEVES THE COMPANY\u2019S CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES ARE THOSE RELATED TO REVENUE RECOGNITION, VALUATION AND IMPAIRMENT OF\nMARKETABLE SECURITIES, INVENTORY VALUATION AND VALUATION OF MANUFACTURING-RELATED ASSETS AND ESTIMATED PURCHASE COMMITMENT CANCELLATION FEES, WARRANTY COSTS, INCOME TAXES AND LEGAL AND OTHER CONTINGENCIES. MANAGEMENT CONSIDERS THESE POLICIES\nCRITICAL BECAUSE THEY ARE BOTH IMPORTANT TO THE PORTRAYAL OF THE COMPANY\u2019S FINANCIAL CONDITION AND OPERATING RESULTS, AND THEY REQUIRE MANAGEMENT TO MAKE JUDGMENTS AND ESTIMATES ABOUT INHERENTLY UNCERTAIN MATTERS. THE COMPANY\u2019S SENIOR\nMANAGEMENT HAS REVIEWED THESE CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND RELATED DISCLOSURES WITH THE AUDIT AND FINANCE COMMITTEE OF THE COMPANY\u2019S BOARD OF DIRECTORS.\nREVENUE RECOGNITION\nNET SALES CONSIST PRIMARILY OF REVENUE\nFROM THE SALE OF HARDWARE, SOFTWARE, DIGITAL CONTENT AND APPLICATIONS, ACCESSORIES, AND SERVICE AND SUPPORT CONTRACTS. THE COMPANY RECOGNIZES REVENUE WHEN PERSUASIVE EVIDENCE OF AN ARRANGEMENT EXISTS, DELIVERY HAS OCCURRED, THE SALES PRICE IS FIXED\nOR DETERMINABLE AND COLLECTION IS PROBABLE. PRODUCT IS CONSIDERED DELIVERED TO THE CUSTOMER ONCE IT HAS BEEN SHIPPED AND TITLE, RISK OF LOSS AND REWARDS OF OWNERSHIP HAVE BEEN TRANSFERRED. FOR MOST OF THE COMPANY\u2019S PRODUCT SALES, THESE CRITERIA\nARE MET AT THE TIME THE PRODUCT IS SHIPPED. FOR ONLINE SALES TO INDIVIDUALS, FOR SOME SALES TO EDUCATION CUSTOMERS IN THE U.S., AND FOR CERTAIN OTHER SALES, THE COMPANY DEFERS REVENUE UNTIL THE CUSTOMER RECEIVES THE PRODUCT BECAUSE THE COMPANY\nRETAINS A PORTION OF THE RISK OF LOSS ON THESE SALES DURING TRANSIT. THE COMPANY RECOGNIZES REVENUE FROM THE SALE OF HARDWARE PRODUCTS, SOFTWARE BUNDLED WITH HARDWARE THAT IS ESSENTIAL TO THE FUNCTIONALITY OF THE HARDWARE AND THIRD-PARTY DIGITAL\nCONTENT SOLD ON THE ITUNES STORE IN ACCORDANCE WITH GENERAL REVENUE RECOGNITION ACCOUNTING GUIDANCE. THE COMPANY RECOGNIZES REVENUE IN ACCORDANCE WITH INDUSTRY SPECIFIC SOFTWARE ACCOUNTING GUIDANCE FOR THE FOLLOWING TYPES OF SALES TRANSACTIONS.\n(I) STANDALONE SALES OF SOFTWARE PRODUCTS, (II) SALES OF SOFTWARE UPGRADES AND (III) SALES OF SOFTWARE BUNDLED WITH HARDWARE NOT ESSENTIAL TO THE FUNCTIONALITY OF THE HARDWARE.\nFOR MULTI-ELEMENT ARRANGEMENTS THAT INCLUDE HARDWARE PRODUCTS CONTAINING SOFTWARE ESSENTIAL TO THE HARDWARE PRODUCT\u2019S FUNCTIONALITY, UNDELIVERED\nSOFTWARE ELEMENTS THAT RELATE TO THE HARDWARE PRODUCT\u2019S ESSENTIAL SOFTWARE AND\/OR UNDELIVERED NON-SOFTWARE SERVICES, THE COMPANY ALLOCATES REVENUE TO ALL DELIVERABLES BASED ON THEIR RELATIVE SELLING PRICES. IN SUCH CIRCUMSTANCES, THE COMPANY\nUSES A HIERARCHY TO DETERMINE THE SELLING PRICE TO BE USED FOR ALLOCATING REVENUE TO DELIVERABLES: (I) VENDOR-SPECIFIC OBJECTIVE EVIDENCE OF FAIR VALUE (\u201cVSOE\u201d), (II) THIRD-PARTY EVIDENCE OF SELLING PRICE (\u201cTPE\u201d) AND\n(III) BEST ESTIMATE OF SELLING PRICE (\u201cESP\u201d). VSOE GENERALLY EXISTS ONLY WHEN THE COMPANY SELLS THE DELIVERABLE SEPARATELY AND IS THE PRICE ACTUALLY CHARGED BY THE COMPANY FOR THAT DELIVERABLE. ESPS REFLECT THE COMPANY\u2019S BEST\nESTIMATES OF WHAT THE SELLING PRICES OF ELEMENTS WOULD BE IF THEY WERE SOLD REGULARLY ON A STAND-ALONE BASIS.\nFOR SALES OF QUALIFYING VERSIONS OF\nIOS DEVICES, MAC AND APPLE TV, THE COMPANY HAS INDICATED IT MAY FROM TIME TO TIME PROVIDE FUTURE UNSPECIFIED SOFTWARE UPGRADES AND FEATURES FREE OF CHARGE TO CUSTOMERS. THE COMPANY ALSO PROVIDES VARIOUS NON-SOFTWARE SERVICES TO OWNERS OF QUALIFYING\nVERSIONS OF IOS DEVICES AND MAC. BECAUSE THE COMPANY HAS NEITHER VSOE NOR TPE FOR THE UNSPECIFIED SOFTWARE UPGRADE RIGHTS OR THE NON-SOFTWARE SERVICES, REVENUE IS ALLOCATED TO THESE RIGHTS AND SERVICES BASED ON THE COMPANY\u2019S ESPS. REVENUE\nALLOCATED TO THE UNSPECIFIED SOFTWARE UPGRADE RIGHTS AND NON-SOFTWARE SERVICES BASED ON THE COMPANY\u2019S ESPS IS DEFERRED AND RECOGNIZED ON A STRAIGHT-LINE BASIS OVER THE ESTIMATED PERIOD THE SOFTWARE UPGRADES AND NON-SOFTWARE SERVICES ARE\nEXPECTED TO BE PROVIDED FOR EACH OF THESE DEVICES, WHICH RANGES FROM TWO TO FOUR YEARS.\nAPPLE INC. | 2014 FORM 10-K | 39\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nTHE COMPANY\u2019S PROCESS FOR DETERMINING ESPS INVOLVES MANAGEMENT\u2019S JUDGMENT AND CONSIDERS MULTIPLE\nFACTORS THAT MAY VARY OVER TIME DEPENDING UPON THE UNIQUE FACTS AND CIRCUMSTANCES RELATED TO EACH DELIVERABLE. SHOULD FUTURE FACTS AND CIRCUMSTANCES CHANGE, THE COMPANY\u2019S ESPS AND THE FUTURE RATE OF RELATED AMORTIZATION FOR SOFTWARE UPGRADES\nAND NON-SOFTWARE SERVICES RELATED TO FUTURE SALES OF THESE DEVICES COULD CHANGE. FACTORS SUBJECT TO CHANGE INCLUDE THE UNSPECIFIED SOFTWARE UPGRADE RIGHTS OFFERED, THE ESTIMATED VALUE OF UNSPECIFIED SOFTWARE UPGRADE RIGHTS, THE ESTIMATED OR ACTUAL\nCOSTS INCURRED TO PROVIDE NON-SOFTWARE SERVICES AND THE ESTIMATED PERIOD SOFTWARE UPGRADES AND NON-SOFTWARE SERVICES ARE EXPECTED TO BE PROVIDED.\nTHE COMPANY RECORDS REDUCTIONS TO REVENUE FOR ESTIMATED COMMITMENTS RELATED TO PRICE PROTECTION AND OTHER CUSTOMER INCENTIVE PROGRAMS. FOR TRANSACTIONS\nINVOLVING PRICE PROTECTION, THE COMPANY RECOGNIZES REVENUE NET OF THE ESTIMATED AMOUNT TO BE REFUNDED, PROVIDED THE REFUND AMOUNT CAN BE REASONABLY AND RELIABLY ESTIMATED AND THE OTHER CONDITIONS FOR REVENUE RECOGNITION HAVE BEEN MET. THE\nCOMPANY\u2019S POLICY REQUIRES THAT, IF REFUNDS CANNOT BE RELIABLY ESTIMATED, REVENUE IS NOT RECOGNIZED UNTIL RELIABLE ESTIMATES CAN BE MADE OR THE PRICE PROTECTION LAPSES. FOR THE COMPANY\u2019S OTHER CUSTOMER INCENTIVE PROGRAMS, THE ESTIMATED COST\nIS RECOGNIZED AT THE LATER OF THE DATE AT WHICH THE COMPANY HAS SOLD THE PRODUCT OR THE DATE AT WHICH THE PROGRAM IS OFFERED. THE COMPANY ALSO RECORDS REDUCTIONS TO REVENUE FOR EXPECTED FUTURE PRODUCT RETURNS BASED ON THE COMPANY\u2019S HISTORICAL\nEXPERIENCE. FUTURE MARKET CONDITIONS AND PRODUCT TRANSITIONS MAY REQUIRE THE COMPANY TO INCREASE CUSTOMER INCENTIVE PROGRAMS THAT COULD RESULT IN REDUCTIONS TO FUTURE REVENUE. ADDITIONALLY, CERTAIN CUSTOMER INCENTIVE PROGRAMS REQUIRE MANAGEMENT TO\nESTIMATE THE NUMBER OF CUSTOMERS WHO WILL ACTUALLY REDEEM THE INCENTIVE. MANAGEMENT\u2019S ESTIMATES ARE BASED ON HISTORICAL EXPERIENCE AND THE SPECIFIC TERMS AND CONDITIONS OF PARTICULAR INCENTIVE PROGRAMS. IF A GREATER THAN ESTIMATED PROPORTION OF\nCUSTOMERS REDEEMS SUCH INCENTIVES, THE COMPANY WOULD BE REQUIRED TO RECORD ADDITIONAL REDUCTIONS TO REVENUE, WHICH WOULD HAVE AN ADVERSE IMPACT ON THE COMPANY\u2019S RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.\nVALUATION AND IMPAIRMENT OF MARKETABLE SECURITIES\nTHE\nCOMPANY\u2019S INVESTMENTS IN AVAILABLE-FOR-SALE SECURITIES ARE REPORTED AT FAIR VALUE. UNREALIZED GAINS AND LOSSES RELATED TO CHANGES IN THE FAIR VALUE OF SECURITIES ARE RECOGNIZED IN ACCUMULATED OTHER COMPREHENSIVE INCOME, NET OF TAX, IN THE\nCOMPANY\u2019S CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS. CHANGES IN THE FAIR VALUE OF AVAILABLE-FOR-SALE SECURITIES IMPACT THE COMPANY\u2019S NET INCOME ONLY WHEN SUCH SECURITIES ARE SOLD OR AN OTHER-THAN-TEMPORARY IMPAIRMENT IS RECOGNIZED. REALIZED GAINS AND\nLOSSES ON THE SALE OF SECURITIES ARE DETERMINED BY SPECIFIC IDENTIFICATION OF EACH SECURITY\u2019S COST BASIS. THE COMPANY REGULARLY REVIEWS ITS INVESTMENT PORTFOLIO TO DETERMINE IF ANY SECURITY IS OTHER-THAN-TEMPORARILY IMPAIRED, WHICH WOULD\nREQUIRE THE COMPANY TO RECORD AN IMPAIRMENT CHARGE IN THE PERIOD ANY SUCH DETERMINATION IS MADE. IN MAKING THIS JUDGMENT, THE COMPANY EVALUATES, AMONG OTHER THINGS, THE DURATION AND EXTENT TO WHICH THE FAIR VALUE OF A SECURITY IS LESS THAN ITS COST;\nTHE FINANCIAL CONDITION OF THE ISSUER AND ANY CHANGES THERETO; AND THE COMPANY\u2019S INTENT TO SELL, OR WHETHER IT WILL MORE LIKELY THAN NOT BE REQUIRED TO SELL, THE SECURITY BEFORE RECOVERY OF ITS AMORTIZED COST BASIS. THE COMPANY\u2019S\nASSESSMENT ON WHETHER A SECURITY IS OTHER-THAN-TEMPORARILY IMPAIRED COULD CHANGE IN THE FUTURE DUE TO NEW DEVELOPMENTS OR CHANGES IN ASSUMPTIONS RELATED TO ANY PARTICULAR SECURITY.\nINVENTORY VALUATION AND VALUATION OF MANUFACTURING-RELATED ASSETS AND ESTIMATED PURCHASE COMMITMENT CANCELLATION FEES\nTHE COMPANY MUST ORDER COMPONENTS FOR ITS PRODUCTS AND BUILD INVENTORY IN ADVANCE OF PRODUCT SHIPMENTS AND HAS INVESTED IN MANUFACTURING PROCESS\nEQUIPMENT, INCLUDING CAPITAL ASSETS HELD AT ITS SUPPLIERS\u2019 FACILITIES. IN ADDITION, THE COMPANY HAS MADE PREPAYMENTS TO CERTAIN OF ITS SUPPLIERS ASSOCIATED WITH LONG-TERM SUPPLY AGREEMENTS TO SECURE SUPPLY OF INVENTORY COMPONENTS. THE COMPANY\nRECORDS A WRITE-DOWN FOR INVENTORIES OF COMPONENTS AND PRODUCTS, INCLUDING THIRD-PARTY PRODUCTS HELD FOR RESALE, WHICH HAVE BECOME OBSOLETE OR ARE IN EXCESS OF ANTICIPATED DEMAND OR NET REALIZABLE VALUE. THE COMPANY PERFORMS A DETAILED REVIEW OF\nINVENTORY THAT CONSIDERS MULTIPLE FACTORS INCLUDING DEMAND FORECASTS, PRODUCT LIFE CYCLE STATUS, PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT PLANS, CURRENT SALES LEVELS AND COMPONENT COST TRENDS. THE COMPANY ALSO REVIEWS ITS MANUFACTURING-RELATED CAPITAL ASSETS AND\nINVENTORY PREPAYMENTS FOR IMPAIRMENT WHENEVER EVENTS OR CIRCUMSTANCES INDICATE THE CARRYING AMOUNT OF SUCH ASSETS MAY NOT BE RECOVERABLE. IF THE COMPANY DETERMINES THAT AN ASSET IS NOT RECOVERABLE, IT RECORDS AN IMPAIRMENT LOSS EQUAL TO THE AMOUNT\nBY WHICH THE CARRYING VALUE OF SUCH AN ASSET EXCEEDS ITS FAIR VALUE.\nAPPLE INC. | 2014 FORM 10-K | 40\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nTHE INDUSTRIES IN WHICH THE COMPANY COMPETES ARE SUBJECT TO A RAPID AND UNPREDICTABLE PACE OF PRODUCT AND\nCOMPONENT OBSOLESCENCE AND DEMAND CHANGES. IN CERTAIN CIRCUMSTANCES THE COMPANY MAY BE REQUIRED TO RECORD ADDITIONAL WRITE-DOWNS OF INVENTORY, INVENTORY PREPAYMENTS AND\/OR MANUFACTURING-RELATED CAPITAL ASSETS. THESE CIRCUMSTANCES INCLUDE FUTURE\nDEMAND OR MARKET CONDITIONS FOR THE COMPANY\u2019S PRODUCTS BEING LESS FAVORABLE THAN FORECASTED, UNFORESEEN TECHNOLOGICAL CHANGES OR CHANGES TO THE COMPANY\u2019S PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT PLANS THAT NEGATIVELY IMPACT THE UTILITY OF ANY OF THESE ASSETS,\nOR SIGNIFICANT DETERIORATION IN THE FINANCIAL CONDITION OF ONE OR MORE OF THE COMPANY\u2019S SUPPLIERS THAT HOLD ANY OF THE COMPANY\u2019S MANUFACTURING PROCESS EQUIPMENT OR TO WHOM THE COMPANY HAS MADE AN INVENTORY PREPAYMENT. SUCH WRITE-DOWNS\nWOULD ADVERSELY AFFECT THE COMPANY\u2019S RESULTS OF OPERATIONS IN THE PERIOD WHEN THE WRITE-DOWNS WERE RECORDED.\nTHE COMPANY RECORDS ACCRUALS FOR\nESTIMATED CANCELLATION FEES RELATED TO COMPONENT ORDERS THAT HAVE BEEN CANCELLED OR ARE EXPECTED TO BE CANCELLED. CONSISTENT WITH INDUSTRY PRACTICE, THE COMPANY ACQUIRES COMPONENTS THROUGH A COMBINATION OF PURCHASE ORDERS, SUPPLIER CONTRACTS AND\nOPEN ORDERS IN EACH CASE BASED ON PROJECTED DEMAND. WHERE APPROPRIATE, THE PURCHASES ARE APPLIED TO INVENTORY COMPONENT PREPAYMENTS THAT ARE OUTSTANDING WITH THE RESPECTIVE SUPPLIER. PURCHASE COMMITMENTS TYPICALLY COVER THE COMPANY\u2019S\nFORECASTED COMPONENT AND MANUFACTURING REQUIREMENTS FOR PERIODS UP TO 150 DAYS. IF THERE IS AN ABRUPT AND SUBSTANTIAL DECLINE IN DEMAND FOR ONE OR MORE OF THE COMPANY\u2019S PRODUCTS, IF THE COMPANY\u2019S PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT PLANS CHANGE, OR IF\nTHERE IS AN UNANTICIPATED CHANGE IN TECHNOLOGICAL REQUIREMENTS FOR ANY OF THE COMPANY\u2019S PRODUCTS, THEN THE COMPANY MAY BE REQUIRED TO RECORD ADDITIONAL ACCRUALS FOR CANCELLATION FEES THAT WOULD ADVERSELY AFFECT ITS RESULTS OF OPERATIONS IN THE\nPERIOD WHEN THE CANCELLATION FEES ARE IDENTIFIED AND RECORDED.\nWARRANTY COSTS\nTHE COMPANY PROVIDES FOR THE ESTIMATED COST OF WARRANTIES AT THE TIME THE RELATED REVENUE IS RECOGNIZED BASED ON HISTORICAL AND PROJECTED WARRANTY CLAIM\nRATES, HISTORICAL AND PROJECTED COST-PER-CLAIM AND KNOWLEDGE OF SPECIFIC PRODUCT FAILURES THAT ARE OUTSIDE OF THE COMPANY\u2019S TYPICAL EXPERIENCE. EACH QUARTER, THE COMPANY RE-EVALUATES THESE ESTIMATES TO ASSESS THE ADEQUACY OF ITS RECORDED\nWARRANTY LIABILITIES CONSIDERING THE SIZE OF THE INSTALLED BASE OF PRODUCTS SUBJECT TO WARRANTY PROTECTION AND ADJUSTS THE AMOUNTS AS NECESSARY. IF ACTUAL PRODUCT FAILURE RATES OR REPAIR COSTS DIFFER FROM ESTIMATES, REVISIONS TO THE ESTIMATED\nWARRANTY LIABILITIES WOULD BE REQUIRED AND COULD MATERIALLY AFFECT THE COMPANY\u2019S RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.\nINCOME TAXES\nTHE COMPANY RECORDS A TAX PROVISION FOR THE ANTICIPATED TAX CONSEQUENCES OF THE REPORTED RESULTS OF OPERATIONS. THE PROVISION FOR INCOME TAXES IS COMPUTED\nUSING THE ASSET AND LIABILITY METHOD, UNDER WHICH DEFERRED TAX ASSETS AND LIABILITIES ARE RECOGNIZED FOR THE EXPECTED FUTURE TAX CONSEQUENCES OF TEMPORARY DIFFERENCES BETWEEN THE FINANCIAL REPORTING AND TAX BASES OF ASSETS AND LIABILITIES, AND FOR\nOPERATING LOSSES AND TAX CREDIT CARRYFORWARDS. DEFERRED TAX ASSETS AND LIABILITIES ARE MEASURED USING THE CURRENTLY ENACTED TAX RATES THAT APPLY TO TAXABLE INCOME IN EFFECT FOR THE YEARS IN WHICH THOSE TAX ASSETS ARE EXPECTED TO BE REALIZED OR\nSETTLED. THE COMPANY RECORDS A VALUATION ALLOWANCE TO REDUCE DEFERRED TAX ASSETS TO THE AMOUNT THAT IS BELIEVED MORE LIKELY THAN NOT TO BE REALIZED.\nTHE COMPANY RECOGNIZES TAX BENEFITS FROM UNCERTAIN TAX POSITIONS ONLY IF IT IS MORE LIKELY THAN NOT THAT THE TAX POSITION WILL BE SUSTAINED ON\nEXAMINATION BY THE TAXING AUTHORITIES, BASED ON THE TECHNICAL MERITS OF THE POSITION.

IN THE EVENT THAT THE COMPANY DETERMINES ALL OR PART OF\nTHE NET DEFERRED TAX ASSETS ARE NOT REALIZABLE IN THE FUTURE, THE COMPANY WILL MAKE AN ADJUSTMENT TO THE VALUATION ALLOWANCE THAT WOULD BE CHARGED TO EARNINGS IN THE PERIOD SUCH DETERMINATION IS MADE.

HOWEVER, OUR INTENT IS TO PERMANENTLY REINVEST THESE FUNDS OUTSIDE OF THE U.S. AND OUR CURRENT PLANS DO NOT DEMONSTRATE A NEED TO REPATRIATE THEM TO FUND OUR U.S. OPERATIONS.\nOUR PRINCIPAL SOURCES OF LIQUIDITY ARE OUR CASH, CASH EQUIVALENTS, AND MARKETABLE SECURITIES, AS WELL AS THE CASH FLOW THAT WE GENERATE FROM OUR OPERATIONS. AS OF\nDECEMBER 31, 2014\n, WE HAD UNUSED LETTERS OF CREDIT OF APPROXIMATELY\n$842 MILLION\n. WE BELIEVE THAT OUR SOURCES OF FUNDING WILL BE SUFFICIENT TO SATISFY OUR CURRENTLY ANTICIPATED CASH REQUIREMENTS THROUGH AT LEAST THE NEXT 12 MONTHS. OUR LIQUIDITY COULD BE NEGATIVELY AFFECTED BY A DECREASE IN DEMAND FOR OUR PRODUCTS AND SERVICES. IN ADDITION, WE MAY MAKE ACQUISITIONS, INCREASE OUR CAPITAL EXPENDITURES, OR LICENSE PRODUCTS AND TECHNOLOGIES COMPLEMENTARY TO OUR BUSINESS AND MAY NEED TO RAISE ADDITIONAL CAPITAL THROUGH FUTURE DEBT OR EQUITY FINANCING TO PROVIDE FOR GREATER FLEXIBILITY TO FUND THESE ACTIVITIES. ADDITIONAL FINANCING MAY NOT BE AVAILABLE OR ON TERMS FAVORABLE TO US.\nWE HAVE A DEBT FINANCING PROGRAM OF UP TO\n$3.0 BILLION\nTHROUGH THE ISSUANCE OF COMMERCIAL PAPER. NET PROCEEDS FROM THIS PROGRAM ARE USED FOR GENERAL CORPORATE PURPOSES. AS OF\nDECEMBER 31, 2014\n, WE HAD\n$2.0 BILLION\nOF COMMERCIAL PAPER OUTSTANDING RECORDED AS SHORT-TERM DEBT, WITH A WEIGHTED-AVERAGE INTEREST RATE OF\n0.1%\nTHAT MATURES AT VARIOUS DATES THROUGH APRIL 2015. AVERAGE COMMERCIAL PAPER BORROWINGS DURING THE YEAR WERE $2.1 BILLION AND THE MAXIMUM AMOUNT OUTSTANDING DURING THE YEAR WAS $2.4 BILLION. IN CONJUNCTION WITH THIS PROGRAM, WE HAVE A\n$3.0 BILLION\nREVOLVING\n33\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nCREDIT FACILITY EXPIRING IN JULY 2016. THE INTEREST RATE FOR THE CREDIT FACILITY IS DETERMINED BASED ON A FORMULA USING CERTAIN MARKET RATES. AS OF\nDECEMBER 31, 2014\n, WE WERE IN COMPLIANCE WITH THE FINANCIAL COVENANT IN THE CREDIT FACILITY AND NO AMOUNTS WERE OUTSTANDING.\nIN MAY 2011, WE ISSUED\n$3.0 BILLION\nOF UNSECURED SENIOR NOTES (2011 NOTES) IN THREE EQUAL TRANCHES, DUE IN 2014, 2016, AND 2021. THE NET PROCEEDS FROM THE SALE OF THE 2011 NOTES WERE USED TO REPAY A PORTION OF OUR OUTSTANDING COMMERCIAL PAPER AND FOR GENERAL CORPORATE PURPOSES. IN FEBRUARY 2014, WE ISSUED\n$1.0 BILLION\nOF UNSECURED SENIOR NOTES (2014 NOTES) DUE IN 2024, WHICH WAS USED TO REPAY $1.0 BILLION OF THE FIRST TRANCHE OF OUR 2011 NOTES THAT MATURED IN MAY 2014 AND FOR GENERAL CORPORATE PURPOSES.\nAS OF\nDECEMBER 31, 2014\n, THE 2011 AND 2014 NOTES HAD A TOTAL CARRYING VALUE OF $3.0 BILLION AND A TOTAL ESTIMATED FAIR VALUE OF\n$3.1 BILLION\n. WE ARE NOT SUBJECT TO ANY FINANCIAL COVENANTS UNDER THE NOTES.\nIN AUGUST 2013, WE ENTERED INTO A $258 MILLION CAPITAL LEASE OBLIGATION ON CERTAIN PROPERTY EXPIRING IN 2028 WITH AN OPTION TO PURCHASE IN 2016. THE EFFECTIVE RATE OF THE CAPITAL LEASE OBLIGATION APPROXIMATES THE MARKET RATE. THE ESTIMATED FAIR VALUE OF THE CAPITAL LEASE OBLIGATION APPROXIMATED ITS CARRYING VALUE AS OF\nDECEMBER 31, 2014.\nLIQUIDITY\nFOR 2012, 2013 AND 2014, OUR CASH FLOWS WERE AS FOLLOWS (IN MILLIONS).\nYEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31,\n2012\n2013\n2014\nNET CASH PROVIDED BY OPERATING ACTIVITIES\n$16,619\n$18,659\n$22,376\nNET CASH USED IN INVESTING ACTIVITIES\n(13,056\n)\n(13,679\n)\n(21,055\n)\nNET CASH PROVIDED BY (USED IN) FINANCING ACTIVITIES\n1,229\n(857\n)\n(1,439\n)\nCASH PROVIDED BY OPERATING ACTIVITIES\nOUR LARGEST SOURCE OF CASH PROVIDED BY OUR OPERATIONS IS ADVERTISING REVENUES GENERATED BY GOOGLE WEBSITES AND GOOGLE NETWORK MEMBERS' WEBSITES.

PRIOR TO THE SALE OF THE MOTOROLA MOBILE BUSINESS, OUR USE OF CASH ALSO INCLUDED PAYMENT FOR MANUFACTURING AND INVENTORY-RELATED COSTS IN THE MOTOROLA MOBILE BUSINESS. IN ADDITION, USES OF CASH FROM OPERATING ACTIVITIES INCLUDE COMPENSATION AND RELATED COSTS, OTHER GENERAL CORPORATE EXPENDITURES, AND INCOME TAXES.\nNET CASH PROVIDED BY OPERATING ACTIVITIES INCREASED\nFROM\n2013\nTO\n2014\nPRIMARILY DUE TO INCREASED NET INCOME ADJUSTED FOR DEPRECIATION AND LOSS ON DISPOSAL OF PROPERTY AND EQUIPMENT AND STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION EXPENSE, AND A NET INCREASE IN CASH FROM CHANGES IN WORKING CAPITAL PRIMARILY DRIVEN BY CHANGES IN PREPAID REVENUE SHARE, EXPENSES, AND OTHER ASSETS.\nNET CASH PROVIDED BY OPERATING ACTIVITIES INCREASED\nFROM\n2012\nTO\n2013\nPRIMARILY DUE TO INCREASED NET INCOME ADJUSTED FOR GAIN ON DIVESTITURE OF BUSINESSES, DEPRECIATION AND AMORTIZATION EXPENSE ON PROPERTY AND EQUIPMENT, STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION EXPENSE, AND AMORTIZATION OF INTANGIBLE ASSETS. THESE INCREASES WERE PARTIALLY OFFSET BY THE NET DECREASE IN CASH FROM CHANGES IN WORKING CAPITAL PRIMARILY AS A RESULT OF A DECREASE IN INCOME TAXES, AN INCREASE IN ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE AND INVENTORIES, OFFSET BY AN INCREASE IN ACCOUNTS PAYABLE.\nCASH USED IN INVESTING ACTIVITIES\nCASH PROVIDED BY OR USED IN INVESTING ACTIVITIES PRIMARILY CONSISTS OF PURCHASES OF PROPERTY AND EQUIPMENT, AS WELL AS ACQUISITIONS AND DIVESTITURES OF BUSINESSES AND INTANGIBLE ASSETS.

PLEASE SEE\nNOTE 3\nOF THE NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS INCLUDED IN ITEM 8 OF THIS ANNUAL REPORT ON FORM 10-K FOR FURTHER DETAILS.\nPOSSIBLE ADJUSTMENT PAYMENT TO CLASS C CAPITAL STOCKHOLDERS\nIN ACCORDANCE WITH A SETTLEMENT OF LITIGATION INVOLVING THE AUTHORIZATION TO DISTRIBUTE THE CLASS C CAPITAL STOCK, WE MAY BE OBLIGATED TO MAKE A PAYMENT (THE POSSIBLE ADJUSTMENT PAYMENT) TO HOLDERS OF THE CLASS C CAPITAL STOCK IF, ON A VOLUME-WEIGHTED AVERAGE BASIS, THE CLASS C CAPITAL STOCK TRADES BELOW THE CLASS A COMMON STOCK DURING THE FIRST\n35\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\n365 DAYS FOLLOWING THE FIRST DATE THE CLASS C SHARES TRADED ON NASDAQ (THE LOOKBACK PERIOD), PAYABLE IN CASH, CLASS A COMMON STOCK, CLASS C CAPITAL STOCK, OR A COMBINATION THEREOF, AT THE DISCRETION OF THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS. HAD WE BEEN OBLIGATED TO MAKE A PAYMENT BASED ON THE VOLUME WEIGHTED AVERAGE PRICE (VWAP) OF THE CLASS A AND CLASS C SHARES FROM APRIL 3, 2014 THROUGH DECEMBER 31, 2014, THE MONETARY VALUE OF THE POSSIBLE ADJUSTMENT PAYMENT WOULD HAVE BEEN APPROXIMATELY\n$593 MILLION\nAS OF DECEMBER 31, 2014.

AT THIS TIME, WE ARE UNABLE TO MAKE A REASONABLY RELIABLE ESTIMATE OF THE TIMING OF PAYMENTS IN INDIVIDUAL YEARS BEYOND 12 MONTHS DUE TO UNCERTAINTIES IN THE TIMING OF TAX AUDIT OUTCOMES. AS A RESULT, THIS AMOUNT IS NOT INCLUDED IN THE ABOVE TABLE.\nOFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS\nAS OF\nDECEMBER 31, 2014\n, WE DID NOT HAVE ANY OFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS, AS DEFINED IN ITEM 303(A)(4)(II) OF REGULATION S-K PROMULGATED BY THE SEC, THAT HAVE OR ARE REASONABLY LIKELY TO HAVE A CURRENT OR FUTURE EFFECT ON OUR FINANCIAL CONDITION, CHANGES IN OUR FINANCIAL CONDITION, REVENUES, OR EXPENSES, RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, LIQUIDITY, CAPITAL EXPENDITURES, OR CAPITAL RESOURCES THAT IS MATERIAL TO INVESTORS.\nCRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES\nWE PREPARE OUR CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS IN ACCORDANCE WITH U.S. GENERALLY ACCEPTED ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES (GAAP). IN DOING SO, WE HAVE TO MAKE ESTIMATES AND ASSUMPTIONS THAT AFFECT OUR REPORTED AMOUNTS OF ASSETS, LIABILITIES, REVENUES, AND EXPENSES, AS WELL AS RELATED DISCLOSURE OF CONTINGENT ASSETS AND LIABILITIES. IN SOME CASES, WE COULD REASONABLY HAVE USED DIFFERENT ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES. IN SOME CASES, CHANGES IN THE ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES ARE REASONABLY LIKELY TO OCCUR FROM PERIOD TO PERIOD. ACCORDINGLY, ACTUAL RESULTS COULD DIFFER MATERIALLY FROM OUR ESTIMATES. TO THE EXTENT THAT THERE ARE MATERIAL DIFFERENCES BETWEEN THESE ESTIMATES AND ACTUAL RESULTS, OUR FINANCIAL CONDITION OR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS WILL BE AFFECTED. WE BASE OUR ESTIMATES ON PAST EXPERIENCE AND OTHER ASSUMPTIONS THAT WE BELIEVE ARE REASONABLE UNDER THE CIRCUMSTANCES, AND WE EVALUATE THESE ESTIMATES ON AN ONGOING BASIS. WE REFER TO ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES OF THIS TYPE AS CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES, WHICH WE DISCUSS FURTHER BELOW. WE HAVE REVIEWED OUR CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES WITH THE AUDIT COMMITTEE OF OUR BOARD OF DIRECTORS.\nPLEASE SEE\nNOTE 1\nOF PART II, ITEM 8 OF THIS ANNUAL REPORT ON FORM 10-K FOR THE SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES.\nINCOME TAXES\nWE ARE SUBJECT TO INCOME TAXES IN THE U.S. AND NUMEROUS FOREIGN JURISDICTIONS. SIGNIFICANT JUDGMENT IS REQUIRED IN EVALUATING OUR UNCERTAIN TAX POSITIONS AND DETERMINING OUR PROVISION FOR INCOME TAXES.\nALTHOUGH WE BELIEVE WE HAVE ADEQUATELY RESERVED FOR OUR UNCERTAIN TAX POSITIONS, NO ASSURANCE CAN BE GIVEN THAT THE FINAL TAX OUTCOME OF THESE MATTERS WILL NOT BE DIFFERENT. WE ADJUST THESE RESERVES IN LIGHT OF CHANGING FACTS AND CIRCUMSTANCES, SUCH AS THE CLOSING OF A TAX AUDIT OR THE REFINEMENT OF AN ESTIMATE. TO THE EXTENT THAT THE FINAL TAX OUTCOME OF THESE MATTERS IS DIFFERENT THAN THE AMOUNTS RECORDED, SUCH DIFFERENCES WILL IMPACT THE PROVISION FOR INCOME TAXES AND THE EFFECTIVE TAX RATE IN THE PERIOD IN WHICH SUCH DETERMINATION IS MADE. THE PROVISION FOR INCOME TAXES INCLUDES THE IMPACT OF RESERVE PROVISIONS AND CHANGES TO RESERVES THAT ARE CONSIDERED APPROPRIATE, AS WELL AS THE RELATED NET INTEREST AND PENALTIES. IN ADDITION, WE ARE SUBJECT TO THE CONTINUOUS EXAMINATION OF OUR INCOME TAX RETURNS BY THE IRS AND OTHER TAX AUTHORITIES WHICH MAY ASSERT ASSESSMENTS AGAINST US. WE REGULARLY ASSESS THE LIKELIHOOD OF ADVERSE OUTCOMES RESULTING FROM THESE EXAMINATIONS AND ASSESSMENTS TO DETERMINE THE ADEQUACY OF OUR PROVISION FOR INCOME TAXES.\nLOSS CONTINGENCIES\nWE ARE REGULARLY SUBJECT TO CLAIMS, SUITS, GOVERNMENT INVESTIGATIONS, AND OTHER PROCEEDINGS INVOLVING COMPETITION AND ANTITRUST, INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY, PRIVACY, INDIRECT TAXES, LABOR AND EMPLOYMENT, COMMERCIAL DISPUTES, CONTENT GENERATED BY OUR USERS, GOODS AND SERVICES OFFERED BY ADVERTISERS OR PUBLISHERS USING OUR PLATFORMS, AND OTHER MATTERS. CERTAIN OF THESE MATTERS INCLUDE SPECULATIVE CLAIMS FOR SUBSTANTIAL OR INDETERMINATE AMOUNTS OF DAMAGES. WE RECORD A LIABILITY WHEN WE BELIEVE THAT IT IS BOTH PROBABLE THAT A LOSS HAS BEEN INCURRED, AND THE AMOUNT CAN BE REASONABLY\n36\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nESTIMATED. IF WE DETERMINE THAT A LOSS IS POSSIBLE AND A RANGE OF THE LOSS CAN BE REASONABLY ESTIMATED, WE DISCLOSE THE RANGE OF THE POSSIBLE LOSS IN THE NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.\nWE EVALUATE, ON A MONTHLY BASIS, DEVELOPMENTS IN OUR LEGAL MATTERS THAT COULD AFFECT THE AMOUNT OF LIABILITY THAT HAS BEEN PREVIOUSLY ACCRUED, AND THE MATTERS AND RELATED RANGES OF POSSIBLE LOSSES DISCLOSED, AND MAKE ADJUSTMENTS AND CHANGES TO OUR DISCLOSURES AS APPROPRIATE. SIGNIFICANT JUDGMENT IS REQUIRED TO DETERMINE BOTH LIKELIHOOD OF THERE BEING AND THE ESTIMATED AMOUNT OF A LOSS RELATED TO SUCH MATTERS. UNTIL THE FINAL RESOLUTION OF SUCH MATTERS, THERE MAY BE AN EXPOSURE TO LOSS IN EXCESS OF THE AMOUNT RECORDED, AND SUCH AMOUNTS COULD BE MATERIAL. SHOULD ANY OF OUR ESTIMATES AND ASSUMPTIONS CHANGE OR PROVE TO HAVE BEEN INCORRECT, IT COULD HAVE A MATERIAL IMPACT ON OUR BUSINESS, CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL POSITION, RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, OR CASH FLOWS. SEE NOTE 10 OF NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS INCLUDED IN ITEM 8 OF THIS ANNUAL REPORT ON FORM 10-K FOR ADDITIONAL INFORMATION REGARDING CONTINGENCIES.\nBUSINESS COMBINATIONS\nWE ALLOCATE THE FAIR VALUE OF PURCHASE CONSIDERATION TO THE TANGIBLE ASSETS ACQUIRED, LIABILITIES ASSUMED AND INTANGIBLE ASSETS ACQUIRED BASED ON THEIR ESTIMATED FAIR VALUES. THE EXCESS OF THE FAIR VALUE OF PURCHASE CONSIDERATION OVER THE FAIR VALUES OF THESE IDENTIFIABLE ASSETS AND LIABILITIES IS RECORDED AS GOODWILL. WHEN DETERMINING THE FAIR VALUES OF ASSETS ACQUIRED AND LIABILITIES ASSUMED, MANAGEMENT MAKES SIGNIFICANT ESTIMATES AND ASSUMPTIONS, ESPECIALLY WITH RESPECT TO INTANGIBLE ASSETS.\nCRITICAL ESTIMATES IN VALUING CERTAIN INTANGIBLE ASSETS INCLUDE BUT ARE NOT LIMITED TO FUTURE EXPECTED CASH FLOWS FROM CUSTOMER RELATIONSHIPS AND ACQUIRED PATENTS AND DEVELOPED TECHNOLOGY; AND DISCOUNT RATES. MANAGEMENT\u2019S ESTIMATES OF FAIR VALUE ARE BASED UPON ASSUMPTIONS BELIEVED TO BE REASONABLE, BUT WHICH ARE INHERENTLY UNCERTAIN AND UNPREDICTABLE AND, AS A RESULT, ACTUAL RESULTS MAY DIFFER FROM ESTIMATES.\nOTHER ESTIMATES ASSOCIATED WITH THE ACCOUNTING FOR ACQUISITIONS MAY CHANGE AS ADDITIONAL INFORMATION BECOMES AVAILABLE REGARDING THE ASSETS ACQUIRED AND LIABILITIES ASSUMED, AS MORE FULLY DISCUSSED IN NOTE 5 OF NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS INCLUDED IN ITEM 8 OF THIS ANNUAL REPORT ON FORM 10-K.\nGOODWILL\nGOODWILL IS ALLOCATED TO REPORTING UNITS EXPECTED TO BENEFIT FROM THE BUSINESS COMBINATION. WE TEST GOODWILL FOR IMPAIRMENT AT THE REPORTING UNIT LEVEL AT LEAST ANNUALLY, OR MORE FREQUENTLY IF EVENTS OR CHANGES IN CIRCUMSTANCES OCCUR THAT WOULD MORE LIKELY THAN NOT REDUCE THE FAIR VALUE OF A REPORTING UNIT BELOW ITS CARRYING VALUE. GOODWILL IMPAIRMENT TESTS REQUIRE JUDGMENT, INCLUDING THE IDENTIFICATION OF REPORTING UNITS, ASSIGNMENT OF ASSETS AND LIABILITIES TO REPORTING UNITS, ASSIGNMENT OF GOODWILL TO REPORTING UNITS, AND DETERMINATION OF THE FAIR VALUE OF EACH REPORTING UNIT. AS OF\nDECEMBER 31, 2014\n, NO IMPAIRMENT OF GOODWILL HAS BEEN IDENTIFIED.\nLONG-LIVED ASSETS\nLONG-LIVED ASSETS, INCLUDING PROPERTY AND EQUIPMENT, LONG-TERM PREPAYMENTS, AND INTANGIBLE ASSETS, EXCLUDING GOODWILL, ARE REVIEWED FOR IMPAIRMENT WHENEVER EVENTS OR CHANGES IN CIRCUMSTANCES INDICATE THAT THE CARRYING AMOUNT OF AN ASSET MAY NOT BE RECOVERABLE. THE EVALUATION IS PERFORMED AT THE LOWEST LEVEL OF IDENTIFIABLE CASH FLOWS INDEPENDENT OF OTHER ASSETS. AN IMPAIRMENT LOSS WOULD BE RECOGNIZED WHEN ESTIMATED UNDISCOUNTED FUTURE CASH FLOWS GENERATED FROM THE ASSETS ARE LESS THAN THEIR CARRYING AMOUNT. MEASUREMENT OF AN IMPAIRMENT LOSS WOULD BE BASED ON THE EXCESS OF THE CARRYING AMOUNT OF THE ASSET GROUP OVER ITS FAIR VALUE.\nIMPAIRMENT OF MARKETABLE AND NON-MARKETABLE SECURITIES\nWE PERIODICALLY REVIEW OUR MARKETABLE AND NON-MARKETABLE SECURITIES FOR IMPAIRMENT. IF WE CONCLUDE THAT ANY OF THESE INVESTMENTS ARE IMPAIRED, WE DETERMINE WHETHER SUCH IMPAIRMENT IS OTHER-THAN-TEMPORARY. FACTORS WE CONSIDER TO MAKE SUCH DETERMINATION INCLUDE THE DURATION AND SEVERITY OF THE IMPAIRMENT, THE REASON FOR THE DECLINE IN VALUE AND THE POTENTIAL RECOVERY PERIOD AND OUR INTENT TO SELL. FOR MARKETABLE DEBT SECURITIES, WE ALSO CONSIDER WHETHER (1) IT IS MORE LIKELY THAN NOT THAT WE WILL BE REQUIRED TO SELL THE SECURITY BEFORE RECOVERY OF ITS AMORTIZED COST BASIS, AND (2) THE AMORTIZED COST BASIS CANNOT BE RECOVERED AS A RESULT OF CREDIT LOSSES. IF ANY IMPAIRMENT IS CONSIDERED OTHER-THAN-TEMPORARY, WE WILL WRITE DOWN THE ASSET TO ITS FAIR VALUE AND RECORD THE CORRESPONDING CHARGE AS INTEREST AND OTHER INCOME, NET.\n37\nTABLE OF CONTENTS","39027":"ITEM 7.

THIS WAS PARTIALLY OFFSET BY A DECREASE IN CAPITAL EXPENDITURES.\nNON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES\nREVENUE EX-TAC\n.    REVENUE EX-TAC IS A NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURE DEFINED AS GAAP REVENUE LESS TAC. TAC CONSISTS OF\nPAYMENTS MADE TO AFFILIATES THAT HAVE INTEGRATED OUR ADVERTISING OFFERINGS INTO THEIR SITES AND PAYMENTS MADE TO COMPANIES THAT DIRECT CONSUMER AND BUSINESS TRAFFIC TO YAHOO PROPERTIES. BASED ON THE TERMS OF THE SEARCH AGREEMENT WITH MICROSOFT\nDESCRIBED IN NOTE 19\u0097\u0093SEARCH AGREEMENT WITH MICROSOFT CORPORATION\u0094 IN THE NOTES TO OUR CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS, MICROSOFT RETAINS A REVENUE SHARE OF 12 PERCENT OF THE NET (AFTER TAC) SEARCH REVENUE GENERATED ON YAHOO\nPROPERTIES AND AFFILIATE SITES IN TRANSITIONED MARKETS. WE REPORT THE NET REVENUE WE RECEIVE UNDER THE SEARCH AGREEMENT AS REVENUE AND NO LONGER PRESENT THE ASSOCIATED TAC. ACCORDINGLY, FOR TRANSITIONED MARKETS WE REPORT GAAP REVENUE ASSOCIATED\nWITH THE SEARCH AGREEMENT ON A NET (AFTER TAC) BASIS RATHER THAN A GROSS BASIS. FOR MARKETS THAT HAD NOT YET TRANSITIONED, REVENUE CONTINUED TO BE RECORDED ON A GROSS (BEFORE TAC) BASIS, AND TAC IS RECORDED AS A PART OF OPERATING EXPENSES.\nWE PRESENT REVENUE EX-TAC TO PROVIDE INVESTORS A METRIC USED BY US FOR EVALUATION AND DECISION-MAKING PURPOSES DURING THE MICROSOFT TRANSITION AND TO\nPROVIDE INVESTORS WITH COMPARABLE REVENUE NUMBERS WHEN COMPARING PERIODS PRECEDING, DURING AND FOLLOWING THE TRANSITION PERIOD. A LIMITATION OF REVENUE EX-TAC IS THAT IT IS A MEASURE WHICH WE HAVE DEFINED FOR INTERNAL AND INVESTOR PURPOSES THAT MAY\nBE UNIQUE TO US, AND THEREFORE IT MAY NOT ENHANCE THE COMPARABILITY OF OUR RESULTS TO OTHER COMPANIES IN OUR INDUSTRY WHO HAVE SIMILAR BUSINESS ARRANGEMENTS BUT ADDRESS THE IMPACT OF TAC DIFFERENTLY. MANAGEMENT COMPENSATES FOR THESE LIMITATIONS BY\nALSO RELYING ON THE COMPARABLE GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES OF REVENUE AND TOTAL OPERATING EXPENSES, WHICH INCLUDE TAC IN NON-TRANSITIONED MARKETS.\n45\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nADJUSTED EBITDA\n.    ADJUSTED EBITDA IS A NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURE\nDEFINED AS NET INCOME ATTRIBUTABLE TO YAHOO! INC. BEFORE TAXES, DEPRECIATION, AMORTIZATION OF INTANGIBLE ASSETS, STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION EXPENSE, OTHER INCOME, NET (WHICH INCLUDES INTEREST), EARNINGS IN EQUITY INTERESTS, NET INCOME ATTRIBUTABLE TO\nNONCONTROLLING INTERESTS, AND CERTAIN GAINS, LOSSES, AND EXPENSES THAT WE DO NOT BELIEVE ARE INDICATIVE OF OUR ONGOING RESULTS.\nWE PRESENT ADJUSTED\nEBITDA BECAUSE THE EXCLUSION OF CERTAIN GAINS, LOSSES, AND EXPENSES FACILITATES COMPARISONS OF THE OPERATING PERFORMANCE OF OUR COMPANY ON A PERIOD TO PERIOD BASIS. ADJUSTED EBITDA HAS LIMITATIONS AS AN ANALYTICAL TOOL AND SHOULD NOT BE CONSIDERED\nIN ISOLATION OR AS A SUBSTITUTE FOR RESULTS REPORTED UNDER GAAP. THESE LIMITATIONS INCLUDE: ADJUSTED EBITDA DOES NOT REFLECT TAX PAYMENTS AND SUCH PAYMENTS REFLECT A REDUCTION IN CASH AVAILABLE TO US; ADJUSTED EBITDA DOES NOT REFLECT THE PERIODIC\nCOSTS OF CERTAIN CAPITALIZED TANGIBLE AND INTANGIBLE ASSETS USED IN GENERATING REVENUES IN OUR BUSINESSES; ADJUSTED EBITDA DOES NOT INCLUDE STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION EXPENSE RELATED TO OUR WORKFORCE; ADJUSTED EBITDA ALSO EXCLUDES OTHER INCOME, NET\n(WHICH INCLUDES INTEREST), EARNINGS IN EQUITY INTERESTS, NET INCOME ATTRIBUTABLE TO NONCONTROLLING INTERESTS AND CERTAIN GAINS, LOSSES, AND EXPENSES THAT WE DO NOT BELIEVE ARE INDICATIVE OF OUR ONGOING RESULTS, AND THESE ITEMS MAY REPRESENT A\nREDUCTION OR INCREASE IN CASH AVAILABLE TO US. ADJUSTED EBITDA IS A MEASURE THAT MAY BE UNIQUE TO US, AND THEREFORE IT MAY NOT ENHANCE THE COMPARABILITY OF OUR RESULTS TO OTHER COMPANIES IN OUR INDUSTRY. MANAGEMENT COMPENSATES FOR THESE LIMITATIONS\nBY ALSO RELYING ON THE COMPARABLE GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURE OF NET INCOME ATTRIBUTABLE TO YAHOO! INC., WHICH INCLUDES TAXES, DEPRECIATION, AMORTIZATION, STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION EXPENSE, OTHER INCOME, NET (WHICH INCLUDES INTEREST), EARNINGS IN EQUITY\nINTERESTS, NET INCOME ATTRIBUTABLE TO NONCONTROLLING INTERESTS AND THE OTHER GAINS, LOSSES AND EXPENSES THAT ARE EXCLUDED FROM ADJUSTED EBITDA.\nFREE CASH FLOW\n.    FREE CASH FLOW IS A NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURE DEFINED AS NET CASH PROVIDED BY (USED IN) OPERATING\nACTIVITIES (ADJUSTED TO INCLUDE EXCESS TAX BENEFITS FROM STOCK-BASED AWARDS), LESS (I) ACQUISITION OF PROPERTY AND EQUIPMENT, NET AND (II) DIVIDENDS RECEIVED FROM EQUITY INVESTEES.\nWE CONSIDER FREE CASH FLOW TO BE A LIQUIDITY MEASURE WHICH PROVIDES USEFUL INFORMATION TO MANAGEMENT AND INVESTORS ABOUT THE AMOUNT OF CASH GENERATED BY\nTHE BUSINESS AFTER THE ACQUISITION OF PROPERTY AND EQUIPMENT, WHICH CAN THEN BE USED FOR STRATEGIC OPPORTUNITIES INCLUDING, AMONG OTHERS, INVESTING IN OUR BUSINESS, MAKING STRATEGIC ACQUISITIONS, STRENGTHENING THE BALANCE SHEET, AND REPURCHASING\nSTOCK. A LIMITATION OF FREE CASH FLOW IS THAT IT DOES NOT REPRESENT THE TOTAL INCREASE OR DECREASE IN THE CASH BALANCE FOR THE PERIOD. FREE CASH FLOW IS A MEASURE THAT MAY BE UNIQUE TO US, AND THEREFORE IT MAY NOT ENHANCE THE COMPARABILITY OF OUR\nRESULTS TO OTHER COMPANIES IN OUR INDUSTRY. MANAGEMENT COMPENSATES FOR THE LIMITATION OF FREE CASH FLOW BY ALSO RELYING ON THE NET CHANGE IN CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS AS PRESENTED IN OUR CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF CASH FLOWS PREPARED IN ACCORDANCE\nWITH GAAP WHICH INCORPORATES ALL CASH MOVEMENTS DURING THE PERIOD.\nSIGNIFICANT TRANSACTIONS\nACQUISITION OF BRIGHTROLL\nON DECEMBER 12, 2014, THE COMPANY COMPLETED THE ACQUISITION OF BRIGHTROLL, INC. (\u0093BRIGHTROLL\u0094), A LEADING PROGRAMMATIC VIDEO ADVERTISING\nPLATFORM, FOR $583 MILLION. THE TRANSACTION WILL COMBINE YAHOO\u0092S PREMIUM-DESKTOP AND MOBILE VIDEO ADVERTISING INVENTORY WITH BRIGHTROLL\u0092S PROGRAMMATIC VIDEO PLATFORM AND PUBLISHER RELATIONSHIPS TO BRING SUBSTANTIAL VALUE TO ADVERTISERS ON\nBOTH PLATFORMS.\nSEE NOTE 4\u0097\u0093ACQUISITIONS AND DISPOSITIONS\u0094 IN THE NOTES TO OUR CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR ADDITIONAL\nINFORMATION.\n46\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nACQUISITION OF FLURRY\nON AUGUST 25, 2014, WE COMPLETED THE ACQUISITION OF FLURRY, INC.

ALSO IN CONNECTION WITH THE IPO, EACH OF YAHOO AND YHK ENTERED INTO A LOCK-UP AGREEMENT WITH THE\nUNDERWRITERS RESTRICTING THE SALE OF ITS REMAINING ORDINARY SHARES OF ALIBABA GROUP (\u0093ALIBABA GROUP SHARES\u0094) FOR A PERIOD OF ONE YEAR, SUBJECT TO CERTAIN EXCEPTIONS.\nAS A RESULT OF THE IPO, THE TECHNOLOGY AND INTELLECTUAL LICENSE AGREEMENT (\u0093TIPLA\u0094) WITH ALIBABA GROUP WILL TERMINATE ON SEPTEMBER 18,\n2015, THE REMAINING INITIAL TIPLA DEFERRED REVENUE OF $268 MILLION IS NOW BEING RECOGNIZED RATABLY OVER THE REMAINING TERM OF THE TIPLA, AND ALIBABA GROUP\u0092S OBLIGATION TO MAKE ROYALTY PAYMENTS UNDER THE TIPLA CEASED ON SEPTEMBER 24, 2014.\nSEE NOTE 2\u0097\u0093MARKETABLE SECURITIES, INVESTMENTS AND FAIR VALUE DISCLOSURES,\u0094 NOTE 3\u0097\u0093CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENT\nDETAILS,\u0094 AND NOTE 8\u0097\u0093INVESTMENTS IN EQUITY INTERESTS ACCOUNTED FOR USING THE EQUITY METHOD OF ACCOUNTING\u0094 IN THE NOTES TO OUR CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR ADDITIONAL INFORMATION.\nSPIN-OFF OF REMAINING HOLDINGS IN ALIBABA GROUP\nON JANUARY 27, 2015, WE ANNOUNCED A PLAN FOR A SPIN-OFF OF ALL OF OUR REMAINING HOLDINGS IN ALIBABA GROUP INTO A NEWLY FORMED INDEPENDENT REGISTERED\nINVESTMENT COMPANY (REFERRED TO AS \u0093SPINCO\u0094). THE STOCK OF SPINCO WILL BE DISTRIBUTED PRO RATA TO OUR STOCKHOLDERS, RESULTING IN SPINCO BECOMING A SEPARATE PUBLICLY TRADED REGISTERED INVESTMENT COMPANY.

COST OF REVENUE\u0097OTHER CONSISTS OF\nBANDWIDTH COSTS AND OTHER EXPENSES ASSOCIATED WITH THE PRODUCTION AND USAGE OF YAHOO PROPERTIES, INCLUDING AMORTIZATION OF ACQUIRED INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS AND DEVELOPED TECHNOLOGY.\nREVENUE\nWE GENERATE REVENUE PRINCIPALLY FROM SEARCH AND DISPLAY ADVERTISING ON YAHOO PROPERTIES AND AFFILIATE SITES, WITH THE MAJORITY OF OUR REVENUE COMING FROM\nADVERTISING ON YAHOO PROPERTIES. OUR MARGINS ON REVENUE FROM ADVERTISING ON YAHOO PROPERTIES ARE HIGHER THAN OUR MARGINS ON REVENUE FROM ADVERTISING ON AFFILIATE SITES AS WE PAY TAC TO OUR AFFILIATES. ADDITIONALLY, WE GENERATE REVENUE FROM OTHER\nSOURCES INCLUDING LISTINGS-BASED SERVICES, FACILITATING COMMERCIAL TRANSACTIONS, ROYALTIES, AND CONSUMER AND BUSINESS FEE-BASED SERVICES.\nMOBILE REVENUE\nWITH THE SIGNIFICANT PLATFORM SHIFT TO MOBILE DEVICES, INCLUDING SMARTPHONES AND TABLETS, WE HAVE INCREASED OUR STRATEGIC FOCUS ON MOBILE\nPRODUCTS AND MOBILE AD FORMATS. WE HAVE HIRED ENGINEERING AND TECHNICAL TALENT TO HELP US ACCELERATE OUR EFFORTS IN MOBILE DEVELOPMENT, AND INTRODUCED NEW MOBILE APPS AND REFRESHED THE USER EXPERIENCE ON MOBILE ACROSS A NUMBER OF YAHOO PROPERTIES,\nINCLUDING NEWS, SPORTS (INCLUDING FANTASY SPORTS), MAIL, FINANCE, WEATHER, AND SCREEN. WE ARE SEEING AN INCREASE IN THE NUMBER OF OUR DAILY AND MONTHLY MOBILE USERS AS A RESULT OF THESE PRODUCT IMPROVEMENTS. DURING THE YEAR ENDED\nDECEMBER 31, 2014, WE REACHED MORE THAN 575 MILLION MONTHLY MOBILE USERS (INCLUDING TUMBLR).\nMOBILE REVENUE IS GENERATED IN CONNECTION\nWITH USER ACTIVITY ON MOBILE DEVICES, INCLUDING SMARTPHONES AND TABLETS (A \u0093DEVICE-BASED\u0094 APPROACH), REGARDLESS OF WHETHER THE DEVICE IS ACCESSING A MOBILE-OPTIMIZED SERVICE. MOBILE REVENUE IS PRIMARILY GENERATED BY SEARCH AND\nDISPLAY ADVERTISING. MOBILE SEARCH REVENUE IS GENERATED FROM CLICKS ON TEXT-BASED LINKS TO ADVERTISERS\u0092 WEBSITES THAT APPEAR PRIMARILY ON SEARCH RESULTS PAGES. SEARCH REVENUE IS RECOGNIZED BASED ON PAID CLICKS. A PAID CLICK OCCURS WHEN AN\nEND-USER CLICKS ON A SPONSORED LISTING ON YAHOO PROPERTIES OR AFFILIATE SITES FOR WHICH AN ADVERTISER PAYS ON A PER CLICK BASIS. MOBILE DISPLAY REVENUE IS GENERATED FROM THE DISPLAY OF GRAPHICAL AND NON-GRAPHICAL ADVERTISEMENTS ON\nMOBILE. THE COMPANY RECOGNIZES REVENUE FROM DISPLAY ADVERTISING ON YAHOO PROPERTIES AND AFFILIATE SITES AS IMPRESSIONS OF OR CLICKS ON DISPLAY ADVERTISEMENTS ARE DELIVERED. IMPRESSIONS ARE DELIVERED WHEN A SOLD ADVERTISEMENT APPEARS IN PAGES\nVIEWED BY USERS. CLICKS ARE DELIVERED WHEN A USER CLICKS ON A NATIVE ADVERTISEMENT.\nMOBILE REVENUE FOR THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2014 WAS\n$768 MILLION. MOBILE REVENUE IS INCLUDED WITHIN SEARCH, DISPLAY, AND OTHER REVENUE THAT WE HAVE REPORTED. IN THE LATTER HALF OF 2014, WE SAW A SIGNIFICANT INCREASE IN THE CONTRIBUTION OF MOBILE REVENUE TO OUR TOTAL REVENUE. WE EXPECT THIS TREND TO\nCONTINUE IN 2015.\n53\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nSEARCH REVENUE\nSEARCH REVENUE IS GENERATED FROM MOBILE AND PC CLICKS ON TEXT-BASED LINKS TO ADVERTISERS\u0092 WEBSITES THAT APPEAR PRIMARILY ON SEARCH RESULTS PAGES\n(\u0093SEARCH ADVERTISING\u0094). WE RECOGNIZE REVENUE FROM SEARCH ADVERTISING ON YAHOO PROPERTIES AND AFFILIATE SITES. SEARCH REVENUE IS RECOGNIZED BASED ON PAID CLICKS. A PAID CLICK OCCURS WHEN AN END-USER CLICKS ON A SPONSORED LISTING ON YAHOO\nPROPERTIES OR AFFILIATE SITES FOR WHICH AN ADVERTISER PAYS ON A PER CLICK BASIS. UNDER THE SEARCH AGREEMENT WITH MICROSOFT, IN TRANSITIONED MARKETS WE REPORT AS REVENUE OUR 88 PERCENT REVENUE SHARE AS WE ARE NOT THE PRIMARY OBLIGOR IN THE\nARRANGEMENT WITH THE ADVERTISERS AND PUBLISHERS, AND THE AMOUNTS PAID TO AFFILIATES ARE RECORDED AS A REDUCTION OF REVENUE. PRIOR TO TRANSITION, WE PAID AFFILIATES TAC FOR THE REVENUE GENERATED FROM THE SEARCH ADVERTISEMENTS ON AFFILIATE SITES. THE\nREVENUE DERIVED FROM THESE ARRANGEMENTS IS REPORTED ON A GROSS BASIS (BEFORE DEDUCTING THE TAC PAID TO AFFILIATES AS COST OF REVENUE\u0097TAC), AS WE WERE THE PRIMARY OBLIGOR TO THE ADVERTISERS IN NON-TRANSITIONED MARKETS. THE SEARCH REVENUE\nGENERATED FROM MOBILE ADS SERVED THROUGH YAHOO GEMINI THAT INVOLVE TRAFFIC SUPPLIED BY AFFILIATES IS REPORTED GROSS OF THE TAC PAID TO AFFILIATES (REPORTED AS COST OF REVENUE \u0096 TAC) AS THE COMPANY PERFORMS THE SEARCH SERVICE. ACCORDINGLY, THE\nCOMPANY IS CONSIDERED THE PRIMARY OBLIGOR TO THE ADVERTISERS WHO ARE THE CUSTOMERS OF THE SEARCH ADVERTISING SERVICE. WE ALSO GENERATE SEARCH REVENUE FROM A REVENUE SHARING ARRANGEMENT WITH YAHOO JAPAN FOR SEARCH TECHNOLOGY AND SERVICES AS REPORTED.\nSEARCH REVENUE FOR THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2014 INCREASED BY 3 PERCENT, COMPARED TO THE SAME PERIOD OF 2013, DRIVEN BY REVENUE-PER-SEARCH\nIN THE AMERICAS REGION ON YAHOO PROPERTIES AND GROWTH IN ADVERTISING REVENUE FROM MOBILE, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY THE IMPACT OF THE MICROSOFT TRANSITION IN THE ASIA PACIFIC REGION. SEARCH REVENUE INCREASED FOR THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2014, AS\nCOMPARED TO 2013, DESPITE THE EXPIRATION IN MARCH 2014 OF MICROSOFT\u0092S GUARANTEE OF YAHOO REVENUE-PER-SEARCH UNDER THE SEARCH AGREEMENT (THE \u0093RPS GUARANTEE\u0094) IN THE U.S. THE INCREASE IN SEARCH REVENUE FOR THE YEAR ENDED\nDECEMBER 31, 2014 WAS PRIMARILY ATTRIBUTABLE TO AN INCREASE IN ADVERTISING REVENUE ON YAHOO PROPERTIES IN THE AMERICAS, EMEA, AND ASIA PACIFIC REGIONS OF $94 MILLION, $38 MILLION, AND $15 MILLION, RESPECTIVELY, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY A DECLINE IN\nADVERTISING REVENUE ON AFFILIATE SITES IN THE AMERICAS, EMEA, AND ASIA PACIFIC REGIONS OF $12 MILLION, $8 MILLION AND $76 MILLION, RESPECTIVELY. THE DECLINE IN AFFILIATE SEARCH REVENUE IN THE ASIA PACIFIC REGION WAS DUE TO THE REQUIRED CHANGE IN\nREVENUE PRESENTATION FOR TRANSITIONED MARKETS FROM A GROSS (BEFORE TAC) TO A NET (AFTER TAC) BASIS.\nSEARCH REVENUE FOR THE YEAR ENDED\nDECEMBER 31, 2013 DECREASED BY 8 PERCENT, COMPARED TO 2012. SEARCH REVENUE DECREASED PRIMARILY DUE TO DECLINES IN AFFILIATE REVENUE IN THE ASIA PACIFIC REGION RESULTING FROM THE CLOSURE OF OUR KOREA BUSINESS, AND DECLINES IN AFFILIATE REVENUE\nIN THE EMEA REGION DUE TO THE REQUIRED CHANGE IN REVENUE PRESENTATION FOR TRANSITIONED MARKETS FROM A GROSS (BEFORE TAC) TO A NET (AFTER TAC) BASIS. THIS WAS PARTIALLY OFFSET BY INCREASED SEARCH REVENUE IN THE AMERICAS REGION, WHICH RESULTED FROM AN\nINCREASE IN SPONSORED SEARCHES ON YAHOO PROPERTIES AND HIGHER REVENUE PER SEARCH DUE TO IMPROVED AD FORMATS.\nDISPLAY REVENUE\nDISPLAY REVENUE IS GENERATED FROM THE DISPLAY OF GRAPHICAL AND NON-GRAPHICAL ADVERTISEMENTS (\u0093DISPLAY ADVERTISING\u0094). WE EARN REVENUE FROM\nGUARANTEED OR \u0093PREMIUM\u0094 DISPLAY ADVERTISING BY DELIVERING ADVERTISEMENTS ACCORDING TO ADVERTISERS\u0092 SPECIFIED CRITERIA, SUCH AS NUMBER OF IMPRESSIONS DURING A FIXED PERIOD ON A SPECIFIC PLACEMENT. ALSO, WE EARN REVENUE FROM\nNON-GUARANTEED OR \u0093NON-PREMIUM\u0094 DISPLAY ADVERTISING BY DELIVERING ADVERTISEMENTS ON A PREEMPTIBLE BASIS. NON-PREMIUM ADVERTISING ALSO INCLUDES NATIVE ADVERTISING FOR WHICH WE RECOGNIZE REVENUE WHEN A USER CLICKS ON A NATIVE ADVERTISEMENT.\n54\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nWE RECOGNIZE REVENUE FROM DISPLAY ADVERTISING ON YAHOO PROPERTIES AND AFFILIATE SITES AS IMPRESSIONS OF OR\nCLICKS ON DISPLAY ADVERTISEMENTS ARE DELIVERED. IMPRESSIONS ARE DELIVERED WHEN A SOLD ADVERTISEMENT APPEARS IN PAGES VIEWED BY USERS. CLICKS ARE DELIVERED WHEN A USER CLICKS ON A NATIVE ADVERTISEMENT. ARRANGEMENTS FOR THESE SERVICES GENERALLY HAVE\nTERMS OF UP TO ONE YEAR. FOR DISPLAY ADVERTISING ON AFFILIATE SITES, WE PAY TAC TO AFFILIATES FOR THE REVENUE GENERATED FROM THE DISPLAY OF THESE ADVERTISEMENTS ON THE AFFILIATE SITES. THE DISPLAY REVENUE DERIVED FROM THESE ARRANGEMENTS THAT INVOLVE\nTRAFFIC SUPPLIED BY AFFILIATES IS REPORTED ON A GROSS BASIS (BEFORE DEDUCTING THE TAC PAID TO AFFILIATES AS COST OF REVENUE\u0097TAC) AS WE ARE THE PRIMARY OBLIGOR TO THE ADVERTISERS WHO ARE THE CUSTOMERS OF THE DISPLAY ADVERTISING SERVICE.\nDISPLAY REVENUE FOR THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2014 DECREASED BY 4 PERCENT, COMPARED TO 2013, PRIMARILY DUE TO A MIX SHIFT FROM PREMIUM AD\nUNITS TO LOWER MONETIZING NATIVE AD UNITS. THE DECLINE FOR THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2014 WAS PRIMARILY ATTRIBUTABLE TO A DECLINE IN ADVERTISING REVENUE ON YAHOO PROPERTIES IN THE AMERICAS, EMEA, AND ASIA PACIFIC REGIONS OF $64 MILLION, $15\nMILLION, AND $38 MILLION, RESPECTIVELY, AND A DECLINE IN ADVERTISING REVENUE ON AFFILIATE SITES IN THE EMEA REGION OF $8 MILLION, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY AN INCREASE IN ADVERTISING REVENUE ON AFFILIATE SITES IN THE AMERICAS AND ASIA PACIFIC REGIONS OF\n$29 MILLION AND $15 MILLION, RESPECTIVELY. THE GROWTH IN AFFILIATE REVENUE IN THE AMERICAS REGION WAS PRIMARILY ATTRIBUTABLE TO INCREMENTAL REVENUE FROM ACQUISITIONS MADE DURING 2014.\nDISPLAY REVENUE FOR THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2013 DECREASED BY 9 PERCENT, COMPARED TO 2012. THIS DECREASE WAS PRIMARILY ATTRIBUTABLE TO A\nDECLINE IN NUMBER OF ADS THAT WE SOLD ON A PREMIUM BASIS ON YAHOO PROPERTIES IN THE AMERICAS REGION.\nOTHER REVENUE\nOTHER REVENUE INCLUDES LISTINGS-BASED SERVICES REVENUE, TRANSACTION REVENUE, ROYALTIES, AND FEES REVENUE. LISTINGS-BASED SERVICES REVENUE IS GENERATED\nFROM A VARIETY OF CONSUMER AND BUSINESS LISTINGS-BASED SERVICES, INCLUDING CLASSIFIED ADVERTISING, SUCH AS YAHOO LOCAL AND OTHER SERVICES. WE RECOGNIZE LISTINGS-BASED SERVICES REVENUE WHEN THE SERVICES ARE PERFORMED. TRANSACTION REVENUE IS GENERATED\nFROM FACILITATING COMMERCIAL TRANSACTIONS THROUGH YAHOO PROPERTIES, PRINCIPALLY FROM YAHOO SMALL BUSINESS, YAHOO TRAVEL, AND YAHOO SHOPPING. WE RECOGNIZE TRANSACTION REVENUE WHEN THERE IS EVIDENCE THAT QUALIFYING TRANSACTIONS HAVE OCCURRED. WE ALSO\nRECEIVE ROYALTIES FROM YAHOO JAPAN AND ALIBABA GROUP THAT ARE RECOGNIZED WHEN EARNED. SEE NOTE 8\u0097\u0093INVESTMENTS IN EQUITY INTERESTS ACCOUNTED FOR USING THE EQUITY METHOD OF ACCOUNTING\u0094 IN THE NOTES TO OUR CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL\nSTATEMENTS FOR ADDITIONAL INFORMATION ON REVENUE EARNED FROM YAHOO JAPAN AND ALIBABA GROUP. FEES REVENUE CONSISTS OF REVENUE GENERATED FROM A VARIETY OF CONSUMER AND BUSINESS FEE-BASED SERVICES AS WELL AS SERVICES FOR SMALL BUSINESSES. WE RECOGNIZE\nFEES REVENUE WHEN THE SERVICES ARE PERFORMED.\nOTHER REVENUE FOR THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2014 DECREASED BY 3 PERCENT, COMPARED TO 2013. THE\nDECREASE FOR THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2014 WAS PRIMARILY ATTRIBUTABLE TO A DECLINE IN LISTINGS-BASED REVENUE IN THE AMERICAS, EMEA AND ASIA PACIFIC REGIONS OF $47 MILLION, $15 MILLION, AND $6 MILLION, RESPECTIVELY, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY AN\nINCREASE IN FEES REVENUE IN THE AMERICAS REGION OF $37 MILLION. THE INCREASE IN FEES REVENUE IN THE AMERICAS REGION FOR THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2014 WAS PRIMARILY ATTRIBUTABLE TO ROYALTY REVENUE ASSOCIATED WITH THE PATENT SALE AND LICENSE\nAGREEMENT THAT WE ENTERED INTO IN THE SECOND QUARTER OF 2014. SEE \u0093SIGNIFICANT TRANSACTIONS\u0097PATENT SALE AND LICENSE AGREEMENT\u0094 FOR ADDITIONAL INFORMATION.\nOTHER REVENUE FOR THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2013 INCREASED BY 3 PERCENT, COMPARED TO 2012. THE INCREASE WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO INCREASED ROYALTY\nREVENUE RESULTING FROM THE AMENDED TIPLA AGREEMENT WITH ALIBABA GROUP. THIS WAS PARTIALLY OFFSET BY A DECREASE IN LISTINGS-BASED REVENUE IN THE AMERICAS REGION.\n55\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nSEARCH AND DISPLAY METRICS\nWE PRESENT INFORMATION BELOW REGARDING THE NUMBER OF \u0093PAID CLICKS\u0094 AND \u0093PRICE-PER-CLICK\u0094 FOR SEARCH AND THE NUMBER OF \u0093ADS\nSOLD\u0094 AND \u0093PRICE-PER-AD\u0094 FOR DISPLAY. THIS INFORMATION IS DERIVED FROM INTERNAL DATA.\n\u0093PAID CLICKS\u0094 ARE DEFINED AS CLICKS\nBY END-USERS ON SPONSORED SEARCH LISTINGS (EXCLUDING NATIVE AD UNITS) ON YAHOO PROPERTIES AND AFFILIATE SITES. ADVERTISERS GENERALLY PAY FOR SPONSORED SEARCH LISTINGS ON A PER-CLICK BASIS. \u0093SEARCH CLICK-DRIVEN REVENUE\u0094 IS GROSS SEARCH\nREVENUE (GAAP SEARCH REVENUE PLUS THE RELATED REVENUE SHARE WITH THIRD PARTIES), EXCLUDING THE MICROSOFT RPS GUARANTEE AND SEARCH REVENUE FROM YAHOO JAPAN. \u0093PRICE-PER-CLICK\u0094 IS DEFINED AS SEARCH CLICK-DRIVEN REVENUE DIVIDED BY OUR TOTAL\nNUMBER OF PAID CLICKS.\n\u0093ADS SOLD\u0094 CONSIST OF DISPLAY AD IMPRESSIONS FOR PAYING ADVERTISERS ON YAHOO PROPERTIES.\n\u0093PRICE-PER-AD\u0094\nIS DEFINED AS DISPLAY REVENUE FROM YAHOO PROPERTIES DIVIDED BY OUR TOTAL NUMBER OF ADS SOLD. OUR PRICE AND VOLUME METRICS FOR DISPLAY ARE BASED ON\nDISPLAY REVENUE WHICH WE REPORT ON A GROSS BASIS (BEFORE TAC), AND INCLUDE DATA FOR GRAPHICAL, SPONSORSHIP, AND NATIVE AD UNITS ON YAHOO PROPERTIES (INCLUDING MOBILE). OUR PRICE AND VOLUME METRICS FOR DISPLAY EXCLUDE BOTH THE NUMBER OF ADS SOLD AND\nTHE RELATED REVENUE FOR CERTAIN REGIONS AND ACQUIRED COMPANIES WHERE HISTORICAL DATA WAS NOT RETAINED IN A MANNER THAT WOULD SUPPORT PERIOD-TO-PERIOD COMPARISON ON THESE METRICS. THE COUNTRIES AND REGIONS INCLUDED IN OUR DISPLAY METRICS ARE: THE\nU.S., THE UNITED KINGDOM, FRANCE, GERMANY, SPAIN, ITALY, TAIWAN, HONG KONG, SOUTHEAST ASIA, AND INDIA.\nWE PERIODICALLY REVIEW, REFINE AND UPDATE OUR\nMETHODOLOGIES FOR MONITORING, GATHERING, AND COUNTING NUMBER OF PAID CLICKS AND ADS SOLD AND FOR CALCULATING SEARCH CLICK-DRIVEN REVENUE, PRICE-PER-CLICK, AND PRICE-PER-AD.\nTUMBLR, INC. (\u0093TUMBLR\u0094) DATA IS INCLUDED IN OUR DISPLAY METRICS BEGINNING IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2014. THE TUMBLR DATA THAT WE INCLUDED\nFOR THE FIRST AND SECOND QUARTER OF 2014 CONSISTED SOLELY OF NATIVE AD UNITS. ALSO, COMMENCING IN THE THIRD QUARTER OF 2013, WE MADE THREE OTHER UPDATES TO OUR METHODOLOGIES. FIRST, WE HAVE INCLUDED THE IMPRESSIONS AND REVENUE ASSOCIATED WITH OUR\nNATIVE AD UNITS, WHICH ARE DISPLAY ADS THAT APPEAR IN THE CONTENT STREAMS VIEWED BY USERS, IN OUR DISPLAY PRICE AND VOLUME METRICS (ADS SOLD AND PRICE-PER-AD). SECOND, TO PROVIDE METRICS THAT ARE MORE CONSISTENT WITH OUR HISTORICAL REVENUE TRENDS,\nTHE REVENUE AND VOLUME ASSOCIATED WITH OTHER DISPLAY ADVERTISEMENTS SOLD ON A PRICE-PER-CLICK BASIS HAVE BEEN EXCLUDED FROM OUR SEARCH PRICE AND VOLUME METRICS (PAID CLICKS AND PRICE-PER-CLICK) AND THEY WILL CONTINUE TO BE EXCLUDED FROM OUR DISPLAY\nPRICE AND VOLUME METRICS. FINALLY, THE MICROSOFT RPS GUARANTEE HAS BEEN EXCLUDED FROM THE CALCULATION OF PRICE-PER-CLICK. DUE TO THE CLOSURE OF THE KOREA BUSINESS IN THE FOURTH QUARTER OF 2012, \u0093ADS SOLD,\u0094 \u0093PAID CLICKS,\u0094\n\u0093PRICE-PER-AD,\u0094 AND \u0093PRICE-PER-CLICK,\u0094 AS PRESENTED BELOW, EXCLUDE THE KOREA MARKET FOR ALL PERIODS PRESENTED. PRIOR PERIOD AMOUNTS HAVE BEEN UPDATED TO CONFORM TO THE CURRENT PRESENTATION.\nSEARCH METRICS\nFOR THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2014,\nPAID CLICKS INCREASED 5 PERCENT AND PRICE-PER-CLICK INCREASED 11 PERCENT, COMPARED TO 2013. THE INCREASE IN PAID CLICKS FOR THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2014 WAS ATTRIBUTABLE TO AN INCREASE IN PAID CLICKS ON YAHOO PROPERTIES FROM DISTRIBUTION\nPARTNERS PRIMARILY IN THE AMERICAS REGION, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY A DECLINE IN PAID CLICKS ON AFFILIATE SITES RELATED TO TRAFFIC QUALITY INITIATIVES ACROSS THE REGIONS. THE INCREASE IN PRICE-PER-CLICK FOR THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2014 WAS\nPRIMARILY DRIVEN BY A HIGHER MIX OF TRAFFIC FROM THE AMERICAS REGION, WHICH IS HIGHER MONETIZING AS COMPARED TO OTHER GEOGRAPHIC REGIONS, AND IMPROVED AFFILIATE TRAFFIC QUALITY ACROSS ALL REGIONS RESULTING IN HIGHER PRICE-PER-CLICK. IMPROVEMENTS IN\nPRICE-PER-CLICK RESULTED IN YEAR-OVER-YEAR GROWTH IN SEARCH CLICK-DRIVEN REVENUE FOR THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2014 OF 17 PERCENT.\n56\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nFOR THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2013, PAID CLICKS INCREASED 19 PERCENT AND PRICE-PER-CLICK DECREASED 4\nPERCENT, COMPARED TO 2012. THE INCREASE IN PAID CLICKS WAS ATTRIBUTABLE TO IMPROVED AD FORMATS ON YAHOO SEARCH, INCREASED MOBILE TRAFFIC, AND INCREASED AFFILIATE TRAFFIC IN THE AMERICAS REGION. THE INCREASE IN AFFILIATE TRAFFIC WAS DRIVEN BY\nINCREMENTAL TRAFFIC IN LATIN AMERICA.

THOSE EARNINGS ARE PRINCIPALLY RELATED TO OUR EQUITY INVESTMENT IN YAHOO JAPAN CORPORATION (\u0093YAHOO JAPAN\u0094). IF THOSE EARNINGS WERE TO BE REPATRIATED IN THE FUTURE, WE MAY BE SUBJECT TO ADDITIONAL\nU.S. INCOME TAXES (SUBJECT TO AN ADJUSTMENT FOR FOREIGN TAX CREDITS). IT IS NOT PRACTICABLE TO DETERMINE THE INCOME TAX LIABILITY THAT MIGHT BE INCURRED IF THESE EARNINGS WERE TO BE REPATRIATED.\nOUR GROSS AMOUNT OF UNRECOGNIZED TAX BENEFITS AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2014 WAS $1,024 MILLION, OF WHICH $970 MILLION IS RECORDED ON OUR CONSOLIDATED\nBALANCE SHEETS. THE GROSS UNRECOGNIZED TAX BENEFITS AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2014 INCREASED BY $328 MILLION FROM THE RECORDED BALANCE AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2013 PRIMARILY RELATED TO TAX RESERVES ASSOCIATED WITH THE SALE OF THE ALIBABA GROUP ADSS\nAND FOREIGN TAX CREDITS.\nWE ARE IN VARIOUS STAGES OF EXAMINATION AND APPEAL IN CONNECTION WITH OUR TAXES BOTH IN THE U.S. AND IN FOREIGN\nJURISDICTIONS. THOSE AUDITS GENERALLY SPAN TAX YEARS 2005 THROUGH 2012. AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2014, THE IRS APPEALS DIVISION HAS FINALIZED OUR PROTEST OF THE 2007 AND 2008 AUDIT RESULTS, AND THE IRS EXAM TEAM HAS FINALIZED THE EXAMINATION OF OUR\n2009 AND 2010 U.S. FEDERAL INCOME TAX RETURNS. WE DO NOT PLAN TO APPEAL THE RESULTS OF THE IRS EXAMINATION OF OUR 2009 AND 2010 U.S. FEDERAL INCOME TAX RETURNS. WE HAVE PROTESTED THE PROPOSED CALIFORNIA FRANCHISE TAX BOARD\u0092S ADJUSTMENTS TO THE\n2005 THROUGH 2008 RETURNS, BUT NO CONCLUSIONS HAVE BEEN REACHED TO DATE. WHILE IT IS DIFFICULT TO DETERMINE WHEN THE EXAMINATIONS WILL BE SETTLED OR THEIR FINAL OUTCOMES, WE BELIEVE THAT WE HAVE ADEQUATELY PROVIDED FOR ANY REASONABLY FORESEEABLE\nADJUSTMENT AND THAT ANY SETTLEMENT WILL NOT HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL POSITION, RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, OR CASH FLOWS.\nWE ESTIMATE THAT WE WILL PAY TAXES OF APPROXIMATELY $3.3 BILLION IN THE THREE MONTHS ENDED MARCH 31, 2015 RELATED TO YHK\u0092S SALE OF ALIBABA\nGROUP ADSS IN THE IPO ON SEPTEMBER 24, 2014.

EARNINGS IN EQUITY INTERESTS\nINCREASED DURING THE YEARS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2013 AND 2014, COMPARED TO EACH OF 2012 AND 2013, RESPECTIVELY, PRIMARILY DUE TO CONTINUED IMPROVED FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE FOR ALIBABA GROUP. FOR 2014, THIS INCREASE WAS OFFSET IN PART BY A\nSIGNIFICANT DECLINE IN EARNINGS IN EQUITY INTERESTS DURING THE FOURTH QUARTER OF 2014 BECAUSE, FOLLOWING ALIBABA GROUP\u0092S IPO IN SEPTEMBER 2014, WE NO LONGER ACCOUNT FOR OUR INTEREST IN ALIBABA GROUP USING THE EQUITY METHOD.

REALIZED GAINS OR LOSSES AND DECLINES IN VALUE JUDGED TO BE OTHER-THAN-TEMPORARY, IF ANY, ON\nAVAILABLE-FOR-SALE SECURITIES ARE REPORTED IN OTHER INCOME, NET. THE FAIR VALUE FOR SECURITIES IS DETERMINED BASED ON QUOTED MARKET PRICES OF THE HISTORICAL UNDERLYING SECURITY OR FROM READILY AVAILABLE PRICING SOURCES FOR THE IDENTICAL UNDERLYING\nSECURITIES THAT MAY NOT BE ACTIVELY TRADED AS OF THE VALUATION DATE. AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2014, CERTAIN OF OUR MARKETABLE SECURITIES HAD A FAIR VALUE BELOW COST DUE PRIMARILY TO THE CHANGES IN MARKET RATES OF INTEREST AND YIELDS ON THESE\nSECURITIES.

IN ADDITION, WE HAVE ENTERED INTO INDEMNIFICATION AGREEMENTS WITH OUR DIRECTORS AND CERTAIN OF OUR OFFICERS THAT WILL REQUIRE US, AMONG OTHER THINGS,\nTO INDEMNIFY THEM AGAINST CERTAIN LIABILITIES THAT MAY ARISE BY REASON OF THEIR STATUS OR SERVICE AS DIRECTORS OR OFFICERS. WE HAVE ALSO AGREED TO INDEMNIFY CERTAIN FORMER OFFICERS, DIRECTORS, AND EMPLOYEES OF ACQUIRED COMPANIES IN CONNECTION WITH\nTHE ACQUISITION OF SUCH COMPANIES.

ACCORDINGLY WE ARE NOT\nEXPOSED TO ANY FINANCING, LIQUIDITY, MARKET, OR CREDIT RISK THAT COULD ARISE IF WE HAD SUCH RELATIONSHIPS. IN ADDITION, WE IDENTIFIED NO VARIABLE INTERESTS CURRENTLY HELD IN ENTITIES FOR WHICH WE ARE THE PRIMARY BENEFICIARY. IN ADDITION, AS OF\nDECEMBER 31, 2014, WE HAD NO OFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS THAT HAVE, OR ARE REASONABLY LIKELY TO HAVE, A CURRENT OR FUTURE MATERIAL EFFECT ON OUR CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL CONDITION, RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, LIQUIDITY, CAPITAL EXPENDITURES OR\nCAPITAL RESOURCES.\n75\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nCRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES\nOUR DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF OUR FINANCIAL\nCONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS IS BASED UPON OUR CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS, WHICH HAVE BEEN PREPARED IN ACCORDANCE WITH GAAP. THE PREPARATION OF THESE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS REQUIRES US TO MAKE ESTIMATES, JUDGMENTS, AND\nASSUMPTIONS THAT AFFECT THE REPORTED AMOUNTS OF ASSETS, LIABILITIES, REVENUE AND EXPENSES, AND THE RELATED DISCLOSURE OF CONTINGENT ASSETS AND LIABILITIES. WE BASE OUR ESTIMATES ON HISTORICAL EXPERIENCE AND ON VARIOUS OTHER ASSUMPTIONS THAT WE\nBELIEVE ARE REASONABLE UNDER THE CIRCUMSTANCES, THE RESULTS OF WHICH FORM THE BASIS FOR MAKING JUDGMENTS ABOUT, AMONG OTHER THINGS, THE CARRYING VALUES OF ASSETS AND LIABILITIES THAT ARE NOT READILY APPARENT FROM OTHER SOURCES. ACTUAL RESULTS MAY\nDIFFER FROM THESE ESTIMATES.\nAN ACCOUNTING POLICY IS CONSIDERED TO BE CRITICAL IF IT REQUIRES AN ACCOUNTING ESTIMATE TO BE MADE BASED ON ASSUMPTIONS\nABOUT MATTERS THAT ARE HIGHLY UNCERTAIN AT THE TIME THE ESTIMATE IS MADE, AND IF DIFFERENT ESTIMATES THAT REASONABLY COULD HAVE BEEN USED, OR CHANGES IN THE ACCOUNTING ESTIMATE THAT ARE REASONABLY LIKELY TO OCCUR, COULD MATERIALLY IMPACT THE\nCONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS. WE BELIEVE THAT THE FOLLOWING CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES REFLECT THE MORE SIGNIFICANT ESTIMATES AND ASSUMPTIONS USED IN THE PREPARATION OF OUR CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.\nMANAGEMENT HAS DISCUSSED THE DEVELOPMENT AND SELECTION OF THESE CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES WITH THE AUDIT AND FINANCE COMMITTEE (THE \u0093AUDIT\nCOMMITTEE\u0094) OF OUR BOARD, AND THE AUDIT COMMITTEE HAS REVIEWED THE DISCLOSURE BELOW. IN ADDITION, THERE ARE OTHER ITEMS WITHIN OUR FINANCIAL STATEMENTS THAT REQUIRE ESTIMATION, BUT ARE NOT DEEMED CRITICAL AS DEFINED ABOVE. CHANGES IN ESTIMATES\nUSED IN THESE AND OTHER ITEMS COULD HAVE A MATERIAL IMPACT ON OUR CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.\nREVENUE\nRECOGNITION.\nOUR REVENUE IS GENERATED FROM SEARCH AND DISPLAY ADVERTISING, AND OTHER SOURCES. DISPLAY ADVERTISING REVENUE IS GENERATED FROM THE DISPLAY OF GRAPHICAL AND NON-GRAPHICAL ADVERTISEMENTS AND SEARCH ADVERTISING\nREVENUE IS GENERATED FROM CLICKS ON TEXT-BASED LINKS TO ADVERTISERS\u0092 WEBSITES THAT APPEAR PRIMARILY ON SEARCH RESULTS PAGES, AND FROM REVENUE SHARING ARRANGEMENTS WITH PARTNERS FOR SEARCH TECHNOLOGY AND SERVICES. OTHER REVENUE CONSISTS OF\nLISTINGS-BASED SERVICES REVENUE, TRANSACTION REVENUE, AND FEES REVENUE. WHILE THE MAJORITY OF OUR REVENUE TRANSACTIONS CONTAIN STANDARD BUSINESS TERMS AND CONDITIONS, THERE ARE CERTAIN TRANSACTIONS THAT CONTAIN CONTRACT-SPECIFIC BUSINESS TERMS AND\nCONDITIONS. IN ADDITION, WE ENTER INTO CERTAIN SALES TRANSACTIONS THAT INVOLVE MULTIPLE ELEMENTS (ARRANGEMENTS WITH MORE THAN ONE DELIVERABLE). WE ALSO ENTER INTO ARRANGEMENTS TO PURCHASE GOODS AND\/OR SERVICES FROM CERTAIN CUSTOMERS. AS A RESULT,\nSIGNIFICANT CONTRACT INTERPRETATION IS SOMETIMES REQUIRED TO DETERMINE THE APPROPRIATE ACCOUNTING FOR THESE TRANSACTIONS INCLUDING: (1) WHETHER AN ARRANGEMENT EXISTS; (2) WHETHER FEES ARE FIXED OR DETERMINABLE; (3) HOW THE ARRANGEMENT\nCONSIDERATION SHOULD BE ALLOCATED AMONG POTENTIAL MULTIPLE ELEMENTS; (4) ESTABLISHING SELLING PRICES FOR DELIVERABLES CONSIDERING MULTIPLE FACTORS; (5) WHEN TO RECOGNIZE REVENUE ON THE DELIVERABLES; (6) WHETHER ALL ELEMENTS OF THE\nARRANGEMENT HAVE BEEN DELIVERED; (7) WHETHER THE ARRANGEMENT SHOULD BE REPORTED GROSS AS A PRINCIPAL VERSUS NET AS AN AGENT; (8) WHETHER WE RECEIVE A SEPARATELY IDENTIFIABLE BENEFIT FROM THE PURCHASE ARRANGEMENTS WITH CERTAIN CUSTOMERS FOR\nWHICH WE CAN REASONABLY ESTIMATE FAIR VALUE; AND (9) WHETHER THE CONSIDERATION RECEIVED FROM A VENDOR SHOULD BE CHARACTERIZED AS REVENUE OR A REIMBURSEMENT OF COSTS INCURRED. IN ADDITION, OUR REVENUE RECOGNITION POLICY REQUIRES AN ASSESSMENT AS\nTO WHETHER COLLECTION IS REASONABLY ASSURED, WHICH INHERENTLY REQUIRES US TO EVALUATE THE CREDITWORTHINESS OF OUR CUSTOMERS. CHANGES IN JUDGMENTS ON THESE ASSUMPTIONS AND ESTIMATES COULD MATERIALLY IMPACT THE TIMING OR AMOUNT OF REVENUE RECOGNITION.\nINCOME TAXES.\nSIGNIFICANT JUDGMENT IS REQUIRED IN EVALUATING OUR UNCERTAIN TAX POSITIONS AND DETERMINING OUR PROVISION\nFOR INCOME TAXES. SEE NOTE 16\u0097\u0093INCOME TAXES\u0094 IN THE NOTES TO OUR CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR ADDITIONAL INFORMATION. WE ESTABLISH LIABILITIES FOR TAX-RELATED\n76\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nUNCERTAINTIES BASED ON ESTIMATES OF WHETHER, AND THE EXTENT TO WHICH, ADDITIONAL TAXES WILL BE DUE. THESE LIABILITIES ARE ESTABLISHED WHEN WE BELIEVE THAT CERTAIN POSITIONS MIGHT BE CHALLENGED\nDESPITE OUR BELIEF THAT OUR TAX RETURN POSITIONS ARE IN ACCORDANCE WITH APPLICABLE TAX LAWS. WE ADJUST THESE LIABILITIES IN LIGHT OF CHANGING FACTS AND CIRCUMSTANCES, SUCH AS THE CLOSING OF A TAX AUDIT, NEW TAX LEGISLATION, DEVELOPMENTS IN CASE LAW\nOR INTERACTIONS WITH THE TAX AUTHORITIES. TO THE EXTENT THAT THE FINAL TAX OUTCOME OF THESE MATTERS IS DIFFERENT THAN THE AMOUNTS RECORDED, SUCH DIFFERENCES WILL AFFECT THE PROVISION FOR INCOME TAXES IN THE PERIOD IN WHICH SUCH DETERMINATION IS\nMADE. THE PROVISION FOR INCOME TAXES INCLUDES THE EFFECT OF LIABILITY PROVISIONS AND CHANGES TO RESERVES THAT ARE CONSIDERED APPROPRIATE, AS WELL AS THE RELATED NET INTEREST AND PENALTIES.\nWE RECORD A VALUATION ALLOWANCE AGAINST CERTAIN OF OUR DEFERRED INCOME TAX ASSETS IF IT IS MORE LIKELY THAN NOT THAT THOSE ASSETS WILL NOT BE REALIZED.\nIN EVALUATING OUR ABILITY TO REALIZE OUR DEFERRED INCOME TAX ASSETS WE CONSIDER ALL AVAILABLE POSITIVE AND NEGATIVE EVIDENCE, INCLUDING OUR OPERATING RESULTS, ONGOING TAX PLANNING, AND FORECASTS OF FUTURE TAXABLE INCOME ON A JURISDICTION BY\nJURISDICTION BASIS. IN THE EVENT WE WERE TO DETERMINE THAT WE WOULD BE ABLE TO REALIZE THESE DEFERRED INCOME TAX ASSETS IN THE FUTURE, WE WOULD MAKE AN ADJUSTMENT TO THE VALUATION ALLOWANCE, WHICH WOULD REDUCE THE PROVISION FOR INCOME TAXES.\nGOODWILL.\nGOODWILL IS NOT AMORTIZED BUT IS EVALUATED FOR IMPAIRMENT ANNUALLY OR WHENEVER WE IDENTIFY CERTAIN TRIGGERING\nEVENTS OR CIRCUMSTANCES THAT WOULD MORE LIKELY THAN NOT REDUCE THE ESTIMATED FAIR VALUE OF A REPORTING UNIT BELOW ITS CARRYING AMOUNT. EVENTS OR CIRCUMSTANCES THAT MIGHT INDICATE AN INTERIM EVALUATION IS WARRANTED INCLUDE, AMONG OTHER THINGS,\nUNEXPECTED ADVERSE BUSINESS CONDITIONS, REGULATORY CHANGES, LOSS OF KEY PERSONNEL AND REPORTING UNIT AND MACRO-ECONOMIC FACTORS. GOODWILL IS TESTED FOR IMPAIRMENT AT THE REPORTING UNIT LEVEL, WHICH IS ONE LEVEL BELOW OUR OPERATING SEGMENTS.\nWE IDENTIFIED U.S. & CANADA, LATIN AMERICA, AND TUMBLR AS THE REPORTING UNITS BELOW THE AMERICAS OPERATING SEGMENT; EUROPE AND MIDDLE EAST AS\nTHE REPORTING UNITS BELOW THE EMEA OPERATING SEGMENT; AND TAIWAN, HONG KONG, AUSTRALIA & NEW ZEALAND, INDIA & SOUTHEAST ASIA AS THE REPORTING UNITS BELOW THE ASIA PACIFIC OPERATING SEGMENT. THESE OPERATING SEGMENTS ARE THE SAME AS\nOUR REPORTABLE SEGMENTS.\nWE TEST FOR GOODWILL IMPAIRMENT ANNUALLY AS OF OCTOBER 31 EACH YEAR OR MORE FREQUENTLY IF THERE IS A TRIGGERING EVENT.\nTO TEST FOR IMPAIRMENT, WE USE THE TWO-STEP QUANTITATIVE TEST. THE FIRST STEP OF THE QUANTITATIVE TEST INVOLVES COMPARING THE ESTIMATED FAIR VALUE OF OUR REPORTING UNITS TO THEIR CARRYING VALUES, INCLUDING GOODWILL. IF THE CARRYING VALUE OF THE\nREPORTING UNIT EXCEEDS ITS FAIR VALUE, THE SECOND STEP OF THE QUANTITATIVE TEST IS PERFORMED BY COMPARING THE CARRYING VALUE OF THE GOODWILL IN THE REPORTING UNIT TO ITS IMPLIED FAIR VALUE. AN IMPAIRMENT CHARGE IS RECOGNIZED FOR THE EXCESS OF THE\nCARRYING VALUE OF GOODWILL OVER ITS IMPLIED FAIR VALUE.\nTHE ESTIMATED FAIR VALUES OF THE U.S. & CANADA, LATIN AMERICA, EUROPE, TAIWAN, HONG\nKONG, AND AUSTRALIA & NEW ZEALAND REPORTING UNITS WERE ESTIMATED USING AN AVERAGE OF A MARKET APPROACH AND AN INCOME APPROACH AS THIS COMBINATION IS DEEMED TO BE THE MOST INDICATIVE OF OUR ESTIMATED FAIR VALUE IN AN ORDERLY TRANSACTION\nBETWEEN MARKET PARTICIPANTS AND IS CONSISTENT WITH THE METHODOLOGY USED FOR THE GOODWILL IMPAIRMENT TEST IN PRIOR YEARS. IN ADDITION, WE ENSURE THAT THE ESTIMATED FAIR VALUES UNDER THESE TWO APPROACHES ARE COMPARABLE WITH EACH OTHER. THE FAIR VALUE\nOF THE TUMBLR REPORTING UNIT WAS ESTIMATED USING THE MARKET APPROACH AND WAS DEEMED TO BE THE MOST INDICATIVE OF OUR ESTIMATED FAIR VALUE IN AN ORDERLY TRANSACTION BETWEEN MARKET PARTICIPANTS. THE ESTIMATED FAIR VALUES OF THE MIDDLE EAST AND\nINDIA & SOUTHEAST ASIA REPORTING UNITS WERE DETERMINED USING THE INCOME APPROACH AS THE MARKET APPROACH YIELDED A MUCH HIGHER FAIR VALUE AND WAS NOT COMPARABLE WITH THE INCOME APPROACH. UNDER THE MARKET APPROACH, WE UTILIZE PUBLICLY-TRADED\nCOMPARABLE COMPANY INFORMATION TO DETERMINE REVENUE AND EARNINGS MULTIPLES THAT ARE USED TO VALUE OUR REPORTING UNITS ADJUSTED FOR AN ESTIMATED CONTROL PREMIUM. UNDER THE INCOME APPROACH, WE\n77\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nDETERMINE FAIR VALUE BASED ON ESTIMATED FUTURE CASH FLOWS OF EACH REPORTING UNIT DISCOUNTED BY AN ESTIMATED WEIGHTED-AVERAGE COST OF CAPITAL, REFLECTING THE OVERALL LEVEL OF INHERENT RISK OF A\nREPORTING UNIT AND THE RATE OF RETURN AN OUTSIDE INVESTOR WOULD EXPECT TO EARN. DETERMINING THE ESTIMATED FAIR VALUE OF A REPORTING UNIT IS JUDGMENTAL IN NATURE AND REQUIRES THE USE OF SIGNIFICANT ESTIMATES AND ASSUMPTIONS, INCLUDING SELECTION OF\nMARKET COMPARABLES, ESTIMATED FUTURE CASH FLOWS, AND DISCOUNT RATES.\nTHESE COMPONENTS ARE DISCUSSED BELOW.\n\u0095\nMARKET COMPARABLES\n.    WE SELECT COMPARABLE COMPANIES IN THE SPECIFIC REGIONS IN WHICH THESE REPORTING UNITS OPERATE BASED\nON SIMILARITY OF TYPE OF BUSINESS, PRIMARILY THOSE INVOLVED IN ONLINE ADVERTISING, RELATIVE SIZE, FINANCIAL PROFILE, AND OTHER CHARACTERISTICS OF THOSE COMPANIES COMPARED TO THESE REPORTING UNITS. TRAILING AND FORWARD REVENUE AND EARNINGS MULTIPLES\nDERIVED FROM THESE COMPARABLE COMPANIES ARE APPLIED TO FINANCIAL METRICS OF THESE REPORTING UNITS TO DETERMINE THEIR ESTIMATED FAIR VALUES, ADJUSTED FOR AN ESTIMATED CONTROL PREMIUM.\n\u0095\nESTIMATED FUTURE CASH FLOWS\n.    WE BASE CASH FLOW PROJECTIONS FOR EACH REPORTING UNIT USING A FORECAST OF CASH FLOWS AND A\nTERMINAL VALUE BASED ON THE PERPETUITY GROWTH MODEL. THE FORECAST AND RELATED ASSUMPTIONS WERE DERIVED FROM THE MOST RECENT ANNUAL FINANCIAL FORECAST FOR WHICH THE PLANNING PROCESS COMMENCED IN OUR FOURTH QUARTER. KEY ASSUMPTIONS IN ESTIMATING\nFUTURE CASH FLOWS INCLUDE, AMONG OTHER ITEMS, REVENUE AND OPERATING EXPENSE GROWTH RATES, TERMINAL VALUE GROWTH RATE, AND CAPITAL EXPENDITURE AND WORKING CAPITAL LEVELS.\n\u0095\nDISCOUNT RATES\n.    WE EMPLOY A WEIGHTED AVERAGE COST OF CAPITAL APPROACH TO DETERMINE THE DISCOUNT RATES USED IN OUR CASH\nFLOW PROJECTIONS. THE DETERMINATION OF THE DISCOUNT RATES FOR EACH REPORTING UNIT INCLUDES FACTORS SUCH AS THE RISK-FREE RATE OF RETURN AND THE RETURN AN OUTSIDE INVESTOR WOULD EXPECT TO EARN BASED ON THE OVERALL LEVEL OF INHERENT RISK. THE\nDETERMINATION OF EXPECTED RETURNS INCLUDES CONSIDERATION OF THE BETA (A MEASURE OF VOLATILITY) OF TRADED SECURITIES OF COMPARABLE COMPANIES AND RISK PREMIUMS OF REPORTING UNITS BASED ON INTERNATIONAL COST OF CAPITAL METHODS.\nTHE COMPONENTS ABOVE REQUIRE US TO MAKE ASSUMPTIONS ABOUT THE TIMING AND AMOUNT OF FUTURE CASH FLOWS, GROWTH RATES AND DISCOUNT RATES. SIGNIFICANT\nMANAGEMENT JUDGMENT IS INVOLVED IN DETERMINING THESE ESTIMATES AND ASSUMPTIONS, AND ACTUAL RESULTS MAY DIFFER FROM THOSE USED IN VALUATIONS. CHANGES IN THESE ESTIMATES AND ASSUMPTIONS COULD MATERIALLY AFFECT THE DETERMINATION OF FAIR VALUE FOR EACH\nREPORTING UNIT WHICH COULD TRIGGER FUTURE IMPAIRMENT. TO FACILITATE A BETTER UNDERSTANDING OF HOW THESE VALUATIONS ARE DETERMINED, A DISCUSSION OF OUR SIGNIFICANT ASSUMPTIONS IS PROVIDED BELOW.\nDISCOUNT RATE ASSUMPTIONS FOR THESE REPORTING UNITS TAKE INTO ACCOUNT OUR ASSESSMENT OF THE RISKS INHERENT IN THE FUTURE CASH FLOWS OF THE RESPECTIVE\nREPORTING UNIT AND OUR WEIGHTED-AVERAGE COST OF CAPITAL. WE ALSO REVIEW MARKETPLACE DATA TO ASSESS THE REASONABLENESS OF OUR COMPUTATION OF OUR OVERALL WEIGHTED AVERAGE COST OF CAPITAL AND, WHEN AVAILABLE, THE DISCOUNT RATES UTILIZED FOR EACH OF\nTHESE REPORTING UNITS.\nIN DETERMINING THE FAIR VALUE OF ALL OF THE REPORTING UNITS, WE USED THE FOLLOWING ASSUMPTIONS.\n\u0095\nEXPECTED CASH FLOWS UNDERLYING OUR BUSINESS PLANS FOR THE PERIODS 2015 THROUGH 2025.\n\u0095\nCASH FLOWS BEYOND 2025 ARE PROJECTED TO GROW AT A PERPETUAL GROWTH RATE.\n\u0095\nIN ORDER TO RISK ADJUST THE CASH FLOW PROJECTIONS IN DETERMINING FAIR VALUE, WE UTILIZED DISCOUNT RATES OF APPROXIMATELY 11 PERCENT TO 19 PERCENT FOR EACH OF\nTHESE REPORTING UNITS.\nSEE \u0093OPERATING COSTS AND EXPENSES \u0097 GOODWILL IMPAIRMENT CHARGE\u0094 FOR ADDITIONAL GOODWILL\nIMPAIRMENT INFORMATION FOR THE YEARS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2013 AND 2014 AND ALSO NOTE 5\u0097\u0093GOODWILL\u0094 IN THE NOTES TO OUR CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.\n78\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nLONG-LIVED ASSETS\n.    WE AMORTIZE LONG-LIVED ASSETS, INCLUDING PROPERTY AND\nEQUIPMENT AND INTANGIBLE ASSETS, OVER THEIR ESTIMATED USEFUL LIVES. IDENTIFIABLE LONG-LIVED ASSETS ARE REVIEWED FOR IMPAIRMENT WHENEVER EVENTS OR CHANGES IN CIRCUMSTANCES INDICATE THAT THE CARRYING VALUE MAY NOT BE RECOVERABLE. DETERMINATION OF\nRECOVERABILITY IS BASED ON THE LOWEST LEVEL OF IDENTIFIABLE ESTIMATED UNDISCOUNTED FUTURE CASH FLOWS RESULTING FROM USE OF THE ASSET AND ITS EVENTUAL DISPOSITION. MEASUREMENT OF ANY IMPAIRMENT LOSS IS BASED ON THE EXCESS OF THE CARRYING VALUE OF THE\nASSET OVER ITS FAIR VALUE. FAIR VALUE IS DETERMINED BASED ON THE LOWEST LEVEL OF IDENTIFIABLE ESTIMATED FUTURE CASH FLOWS USING DISCOUNT RATES DETERMINED BY OUR MANAGEMENT TO BE COMMENSURATE WITH THE RISK INHERENT IN OUR BUSINESS MODEL. OUR\nESTIMATES OF FUTURE CASH FLOWS ATTRIBUTABLE TO OUR LONG-LIVED ASSETS REQUIRE SIGNIFICANT JUDGMENT BASED ON OUR HISTORICAL AND ANTICIPATED RESULTS AND ARE SUBJECT TO MANY FACTORS. DIFFERENT ASSUMPTIONS AND JUDGMENTS COULD MATERIALLY AFFECT ESTIMATED\nFUTURE CASH FLOWS RELATING TO OUR LONG-LIVED ASSETS WHICH COULD TRIGGER IMPAIRMENT. NO IMPAIRMENTS OF LONG-LIVED ASSETS WERE IDENTIFIED DURING ANY OF THE PERIODS PRESENTED.\nINVESTMENTS IN EQUITY INTERESTS.\nWE ACCOUNT FOR INVESTMENTS IN THE COMMON STOCK OF ENTITIES IN WHICH WE HAVE THE ABILITY TO\nEXERCISE SIGNIFICANT INFLUENCE BUT DO NOT OWN A MAJORITY EQUITY INTEREST OR OTHERWISE CONTROL USING THE EQUITY METHOD. IN ACCOUNTING FOR THESE INVESTMENTS WE RECORD OUR PROPORTIONATE SHARE OF THE ENTITIES\u0092 NET INCOME OR LOSS, ONE QUARTER IN\nARREARS.\nWE REVIEW OUR INVESTMENTS IN EQUITY INTERESTS FOR IMPAIRMENT WHENEVER EVENTS OR CHANGES IN BUSINESS CIRCUMSTANCES INDICATE THAT THE\nCARRYING VALUE OF THE INVESTMENT MAY NOT BE FULLY RECOVERABLE. INVESTMENTS IDENTIFIED AS HAVING AN INDICATION OF IMPAIRMENT ARE SUBJECT TO FURTHER ANALYSIS TO DETERMINE IF THE IMPAIRMENT IS OTHER-THAN-TEMPORARY AND THIS ANALYSIS REQUIRES ESTIMATING\nTHE FAIR VALUE OF THE INVESTMENT. THE DETERMINATION OF FAIR VALUE OF THE INVESTMENT INVOLVES CONSIDERING FACTORS SUCH AS THE STOCK PRICES OF PUBLIC COMPANIES IN WHICH WE HAVE AN EQUITY INVESTMENT, CURRENT ECONOMIC AND MARKET CONDITIONS, THE\nOPERATING PERFORMANCE OF THE COMPANIES, INCLUDING CURRENT EARNINGS TRENDS AND FORECASTED CASH FLOWS, AND OTHER COMPANY AND INDUSTRY SPECIFIC INFORMATION. THE FAIR VALUE DETERMINATION, PARTICULARLY FOR INVESTMENTS IN PRIVATELY-HELD COMPANIES,\nREQUIRES SIGNIFICANT JUDGMENT TO DETERMINE APPROPRIATE ESTIMATES AND ASSUMPTIONS. CHANGES IN THESE ESTIMATES AND ASSUMPTIONS COULD AFFECT THE CALCULATION OF THE FAIR VALUE OF THE INVESTMENTS AND THE DETERMINATION OF WHETHER ANY IDENTIFIED IMPAIRMENT\nIS OTHER-THAN-TEMPORARY.\nSTOCK-BASED COMPENSATION EXPENSE.\nWE RECOGNIZE STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION EXPENSE NET OF AN\nESTIMATED FORFEITURE RATE AND THEREFORE ONLY RECOGNIZE COMPENSATION EXPENSE FOR THOSE SHARES EXPECTED TO VEST OVER THE SERVICE PERIOD OF THE AWARD. CALCULATING STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION EXPENSE REQUIRES THE INPUT OF HIGHLY SUBJECTIVE ASSUMPTIONS,\nINCLUDING THE EXPECTED TERM OF THE STOCK-BASED OPTIONS, STOCK PRICE VOLATILITY, AND THE PRE-VESTING AWARD FORFEITURE RATE. WE ESTIMATE THE EXPECTED LIFE OF OPTIONS GRANTED BASED ON HISTORICAL EXERCISE PATTERNS, WHICH WE BELIEVE ARE REPRESENTATIVE OF\nFUTURE BEHAVIOR. WE ESTIMATE THE VOLATILITY OF OUR COMMON STOCK ON THE DATE OF GRANT BASED ON THE IMPLIED VOLATILITY OF PUBLICLY TRADED OPTIONS ON OUR COMMON STOCK, WITH A TERM OF ONE YEAR OR GREATER. WE BELIEVE THAT IMPLIED VOLATILITY CALCULATED\nBASED ON ACTIVELY TRADED OPTIONS ON OUR COMMON STOCK IS A BETTER INDICATOR OF EXPECTED VOLATILITY AND FUTURE STOCK PRICE TRENDS THAN HISTORICAL VOLATILITY.\nTHEREFORE, EXPECTED VOLATILITY FOR THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2014 WAS BASED ON A MARKET-BASED IMPLIED VOLATILITY. THE ASSUMPTIONS USED IN\nCALCULATING THE FAIR VALUE OF STOCK-BASED AWARDS REPRESENT OUR BEST ESTIMATES, BUT THESE ESTIMATES INVOLVE INHERENT UNCERTAINTIES AND THE APPLICATION OF MANAGEMENT JUDGMENT. AS A RESULT, IF FACTORS CHANGE AND WE USE DIFFERENT ASSUMPTIONS, OUR\nSTOCK-BASED COMPENSATION EXPENSE COULD BE MATERIALLY DIFFERENT IN THE FUTURE. IN ADDITION, WE ARE REQUIRED TO ESTIMATE THE EXPECTED PRE-VESTING AWARD FORFEITURE RATE, AS WELL AS THE PROBABILITY THAT PERFORMANCE CONDITIONS THAT AFFECT THE VESTING OF\nCERTAIN AWARDS WILL BE ACHIEVED, AND RECOGNIZE EXPENSE ONLY FOR THOSE SHARES EXPECTED TO VEST. PERFORMANCE CONDITIONS ARE ESTIMATED AND\n79\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nMONITORED THROUGHOUT THE YEAR. WE ESTIMATE THIS FORFEITURE RATE BASED ON HISTORICAL EXPERIENCE OF OUR STOCK-BASED AWARDS THAT ARE GRANTED AND CANCELLED BEFORE VESTING. IF OUR ACTUAL FORFEITURE\nRATE IS MATERIALLY DIFFERENT FROM OUR ORIGINAL ESTIMATES, THE STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION EXPENSE COULD BE SIGNIFICANTLY DIFFERENT FROM WHAT WE HAVE RECORDED IN THE CURRENT PERIOD. CHANGES IN THE ESTIMATED FORFEITURE RATE CAN HAVE A SIGNIFICANT EFFECT\nON REPORTED STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION EXPENSE, AS THE EFFECT OF ADJUSTING THE FORFEITURE RATE FOR ALL CURRENT AND PREVIOUSLY RECOGNIZED EXPENSE FOR UNVESTED AWARDS IS RECOGNIZED IN THE PERIOD THE FORFEITURE ESTIMATE IS CHANGED. IF THE ACTUAL\nFORFEITURE RATE IS HIGHER THAN THE ESTIMATED FORFEITURE RATE, THEN AN ADJUSTMENT WILL BE MADE TO INCREASE THE ESTIMATED FORFEITURE RATE, WHICH WILL RESULT IN A DECREASE TO THE EXPENSE RECOGNIZED IN OUR CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS. IF THE\nACTUAL FORFEITURE RATE IS LOWER THAN THE ESTIMATED FORFEITURE RATE, THEN AN ADJUSTMENT WILL BE MADE TO LOWER THE ESTIMATED FORFEITURE RATE, WHICH WILL RESULT IN AN INCREASE TO THE EXPENSE RECOGNIZED IN OUR CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS. SEE\nNOTE 14\u0097\u0093EMPLOYEE BENEFITS\u0094 IN THE NOTES TO OUR CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR ADDITIONAL INFORMATION.\nRECENT\nACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS\nSEE\nNOTE 1\u0097\u0093THE COMPANY AND SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES\u0094 IN THE NOTES TO OUR CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS, WHICH IS INCORPORATED HEREIN BY REFERENCE.","39813":"ITEM 7.    MANAGEMENT\u0092S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS\nOF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nWE BEGIN MANAGEMENT\u0092S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF\nOPERATIONS WITH AN OVERVIEW OF OUR KEY OPERATING BUSINESS SEGMENTS AND SIGNIFICANT TRENDS. THIS OVERVIEW IS FOLLOWED BY A SUMMARY OF OUR CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES THAT WE BELIEVE ARE IMPORTANT TO UNDERSTANDING THE ASSUMPTIONS AND\nJUDGMENTS INCORPORATED IN OUR REPORTED FINANCIAL RESULTS. WE THEN PROVIDE A MORE DETAILED ANALYSIS OF OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION.\nBUSINESS OVERVIEW\nORACLE CORPORATION PROVIDES PRODUCTS AND SERVICES THAT ADDRESS ALL\nASPECTS OF CORPORATE INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY (IT) ENVIRONMENTS\u0097APPLICATION, PLATFORM AND INFRASTRUCTURE\u0097AND ARE AVAILABLE TO CUSTOMERS EITHER VIA CLOUD COMPUTING OR ON-PREMISES DEPLOYMENT MODELS. OUR PRODUCTS INCLUDE DATABASE AND MIDDLEWARE\nSOFTWARE, APPLICATION SOFTWARE, CLOUD INFRASTRUCTURE SOFTWARE, AND HARDWARE SYSTEMS (ORACLE ENGINEERED SYSTEMS, SERVERS, STORAGE, NETWORKING AND INDUSTRY SPECIFIC PRODUCTS), ALONG WITH SUPPORT AND RELATED SERVICES.

OUR ORACLE CLOUD OFFERINGS ARE DESIGNED TO BE: RAPIDLY DEPLOYABLE TO ENABLE CUSTOMERS SHORTER TIME TO INNOVATION; EASILY\nMAINTAINABLE TO REDUCE INTEGRATION AND TESTING WORK; AND COST EFFECTIVE BY REQUIRING LOWER UPFRONT CUSTOMER INVESTMENT. OUR ORACLE CLOUD OFFERINGS INTEGRATE THE SOFTWARE, HARDWARE AND SERVICES ON THE CUSTOMERS\u0092 BEHALF IN IT ENVIRONMENTS THAT WE\nDEPLOY, SUPPORT AND MANAGE FOR THE CUSTOMER. WE ARE A LEADER IN THE CORE TECHNOLOGIES OF CLOUD IT ENVIRONMENTS, INCLUDING DATABASE AND MIDDLEWARE SOFTWARE AS WELL AS ENTERPRISE APPLICATIONS, VIRTUALIZATION, CLUSTERING, LARGE-SCALE SYSTEMS MANAGEMENT\nAND RELATED INFRASTRUCTURE. OUR PRODUCTS AND SERVICES ARE THE BUILDING BLOCKS OF OUR ORACLE CLOUD SERVICES, OUR PARTNERS\u0092 CLOUD SERVICES AND OUR CUSTOMERS\u0092 CLOUD IT ENVIRONMENTS.\nIN ADDITION TO OFFERING A BROAD SPECTRUM OF CLOUD PRODUCTS AND SERVICES, ORACLE FOR DECADES HAS DEVELOPED AND SOLD ITS PRODUCTS AND SERVICES TO OUR CUSTOMERS WORLDWIDE FOR USE IN THEIR GLOBAL DATA CENTERS\nAND ON-PREMISES IT ENVIRONMENTS. AN IMPORTANT ELEMENT OF OUR CORPORATE STRATEGY IS TO CONTINUE OUR INVESTMENTS IN, AND INNOVATION WITH RESPECT TO, OUR PRODUCTS AND SERVICES THAT WE OFFER THROUGH OUR SOFTWARE AND CLOUD, HARDWARE AND SERVICES\nBUSINESSES. IN FISCAL 2015, 2014 AND 2013, WE INVESTED $5.5 BILLION, $5.2 BILLION AND $4.9 BILLION, RESPECTIVELY, IN RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT TO ENHANCE OUR EXISTING PORTFOLIO OF PRODUCTS AND SERVICES AND TO DEVELOP NEW PRODUCTS AND SERVICES. WE\nHAVE A DEEP UNDERSTANDING AS TO HOW ALL COMPONENTS WITHIN IT ENVIRONMENTS\u0097APPLICATION, PLATFORM AND INFRASTRUCTURE\u0097INTERACT AND FUNCTION WITH ONE ANOTHER. WE FOCUS OUR DEVELOPMENT EFFORTS ON IMPROVING THE PERFORMANCE, OPERATION AND\nINTEGRATION OF THESE DIFFERING TECHNOLOGIES TO MAKE THEM MORE COST-EFFECTIVE AND EASIER TO DEPLOY, MANAGE AND MAINTAIN FOR OUR CUSTOMERS AND TO IMPROVE THEIR COMPUTING PERFORMANCE RELATIVE TO OUR COMPETITORS. AFTER PURCHASING ORACLE PRODUCTS AND\nSERVICES, CUSTOMERS CAN CONTINUE TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF ORACLE\u0092S RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT INVESTMENTS AND DEEP IT EXPERTISE BY PURCHASING AND RENEWING ORACLE SUPPORT OFFERINGS, WHICH MAY INCLUDE PRODUCT ENHANCEMENTS THAT WE PERIODICALLY DELIVER\nTO OUR ORACLE E-BUSINESS SUITE, SIEBEL, PEOPLESOFT AND JD EDWARDS APPLICATION SOFTWARE PRODUCTS, AMONG OTHERS, OR RENEWING THEIR SAAS, PAAS AND IAAS CONTRACTS WITH US.\nORACLE CUSTOMERS ARE INCREASINGLY ELECTING TO RUN THEIR IT ENVIRONMENTS USING OUR SUITE OF ORACLE CLOUD OFFERINGS. AS CUSTOMERS DEPLOY WITH THE ORACLE CLOUD, MANY ARE ADOPTING A HYBRID IT MODEL WHEREBY\nCERTAIN OF THEIR IT RESOURCES ARE DEPLOYED AND MANAGED THROUGH THE ORACLE CLOUD, WHILE OTHER OF THEIR IT RESOURCES ARE DEPLOYED AND MANAGED ON-PREMISES, AND BOTH SETS OF RESOURCES CAN BE MANAGED AS ONE. WE FOCUS THE ENGINEERING OF OUR PRODUCTS AND\nSERVICES TO BEST CONNECT THESE DIFFERENT DEPLOYMENT MODELS TO ENABLE FLEXIBILITY, EASE, AGILITY, COMPATIBILITY, EXTENSIBILITY AND SEAMLESSNESS.\nA SELECTIVE AND ACTIVE ACQUISITION PROGRAM IS ANOTHER IMPORTANT ELEMENT OF OUR CORPORATE STRATEGY. WE BELIEVE OUR ACQUISITIONS ENHANCE THE PRODUCTS AND\nSERVICES THAT WE CAN OFFER TO CUSTOMERS, EXPAND OUR CUSTOMER BASE, PROVIDE GREATER SCALE TO ACCELERATE INNOVATION, GROW OUR REVENUES AND EARNINGS, AND INCREASE STOCKHOLDER VALUE.\n37\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nIN RECENT YEARS, WE HAVE INVESTED BILLIONS OF DOLLARS TO ACQUIRE A NUMBER OF COMPANIES, PRODUCTS, SERVICES AND TECHNOLOGIES THAT ADD TO, ARE COMPLEMENTARY TO, OR HAVE OTHERWISE ENHANCED OUR\nEXISTING OFFERINGS. WE EXPECT TO CONTINUE TO ACQUIRE COMPANIES, PRODUCTS, SERVICES AND TECHNOLOGIES TO FURTHER OUR CORPORATE STRATEGY.\nWE HAVE\nTHREE BUSINESSES THAT DELIVER OUR APPLICATION, PLATFORM AND INFRASTRUCTURE TECHNOLOGIES: SOFTWARE AND CLOUD, HARDWARE SYSTEMS, AND SERVICES. THESE BUSINESSES CAN BE FURTHER DIVIDED INTO CERTAIN OPERATING SEGMENTS (NOTE 16 OF NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED\nFINANCIAL STATEMENTS, INCLUDED ELSEWHERE IN THIS ANNUAL REPORT, PROVIDES ADDITIONAL INFORMATION RELATED TO OUR OPERATING SEGMENTS). EACH OF OUR BUSINESSES AND OPERATING SEGMENTS HAS UNIQUE CHARACTERISTICS AND FACES DIFFERENT OPPORTUNITIES AND\nCHALLENGES. ALTHOUGH WE REPORT OUR ACTUAL RESULTS IN U.S. DOLLARS, WE CONDUCT A SIGNIFICANT NUMBER OF TRANSACTIONS IN CURRENCIES OTHER THAN U.S. DOLLARS. THEREFORE, WE PRESENT CONSTANT CURRENCY INFORMATION TO PROVIDE A FRAMEWORK FOR ASSESSING HOW\nOUR UNDERLYING BUSINESSES PERFORMED EXCLUDING THE EFFECTS OF FOREIGN CURRENCY RATE FLUCTUATIONS. AN OVERVIEW OF OUR THREE BUSINESSES AND RELATED OPERATING SEGMENTS FOLLOWS.\nSOFTWARE AND CLOUD BUSINESS\nOUR SOFTWARE AND CLOUD BUSINESS, WHICH\nREPRESENTED 77%, 76% AND 75% OF OUR TOTAL REVENUES IN FISCAL 2015, 2014 AND 2013, RESPECTIVELY, IS COMPRISED OF THREE OPERATING SEGMENTS: (1) NEW SOFTWARE LICENSES AND CLOUD SOFTWARE SUBSCRIPTIONS, (2) CLOUD INFRASTRUCTURE AS A SERVICE AND\n(3) SOFTWARE LICENSE UPDATES AND PRODUCT SUPPORT. ON A CONSTANT CURRENCY BASIS, WE EXPECT THAT OUR SOFTWARE AND CLOUD BUSINESS\u0092 TOTAL REVENUES GENERALLY WILL CONTINUE TO INCREASE DUE TO CONTINUED DEMAND FOR OUR SOFTWARE PRODUCTS AND CLOUD\nSOFTWARE SUBSCRIPTION OFFERINGS, OUR SOFTWARE LICENSE UPDATES AND PRODUCT SUPPORT OFFERINGS, INCLUDING THE HIGH PERCENTAGE OF CUSTOMERS THAT RENEW THEIR SOFTWARE LICENSE UPDATES AND PRODUCT SUPPORT CONTRACTS, AND OUR ACQUISITIONS, WHICH SHOULD ALLOW\nUS TO GROW AND CONTINUE TO MAKE INVESTMENTS IN RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT.\nNEW SOFTWARE LICENSES AND CLOUD SOFTWARE\nSUBSCRIPTIONS.\nOUR NEW SOFTWARE LICENSES AND CLOUD SOFTWARE SUBSCRIPTIONS LINE OF BUSINESS MARKETS, SELLS AND DELIVERS OUR APPLICATION AND PLATFORM TECHNOLOGIES INCLUDING OUR SAAS AND PAAS OFFERINGS (OUR SAAS AND PAAS\nOFFERINGS ARE COLLECTIVELY REFERRED TO AS CLOUD SOFTWARE SUBSCRIPTIONS), WHICH PROVIDE CUSTOMERS A CHOICE OF SOFTWARE APPLICATIONS AND PLATFORMS THAT ARE DELIVERED VIA A CLOUD-BASED IT ENVIRONMENT THAT WE HOST, MANAGE AND SUPPORT, AND THE LICENSING\nOF OUR SOFTWARE PRODUCTS INCLUDING ORACLE APPLICATIONS, ORACLE DATABASE, ORACLE FUSION MIDDLEWARE AND JAVA, AMONG OTHERS. OUR APPLICATION AND PLATFORM TECHNOLOGIES ARE SUBSTANTIALLY BUILT ON STANDARDS-BASED ARCHITECTURES THAT ARE DESIGNED TO HELP\nCUSTOMERS REDUCE THE COST AND COMPLEXITY OF THEIR IT INFRASTRUCTURE. OUR COMMITMENT TO INDUSTRY STANDARDS RESULTS IN SOFTWARE THAT WORKS IN CUSTOMER ENVIRONMENTS WITH ORACLE OR NON-ORACLE HARDWARE OR SOFTWARE COMPONENTS AND THAT CAN BE ADAPTED TO\nMEET SPECIFIC INDUSTRY OR BUSINESS NEEDS. WE FOCUS THE ENGINEERING OF OUR PRODUCTS AND SERVICES TO BEST CONNECT CLOUD AND ON-PREMISES DEPLOYMENT MODELS TO ENABLE FLEXIBILITY, EASE, AGILITY, COMPATIBILITY, EXTENSIBILITY AND SEAMLESSNESS. OUR SOFTWARE\nOFFERINGS ARE SUBSTANTIALLY DESIGNED TO OPERATE ON BOTH SINGLE SERVER AND CLUSTERED SERVER CONFIGURATIONS FOR CLOUD OR ON-PREMISES IT ENVIRONMENTS, AND TO SUPPORT A CHOICE OF OPERATING SYSTEMS INCLUDING ORACLE SOLARIS, ORACLE LINUX, MICROSOFT\nWINDOWS AND THIRD PARTY UNIX PRODUCTS, AMONG OTHERS. THESE APPROACHES ARE DESIGNED TO SUPPORT CUSTOMER CHOICE AND REDUCE CUSTOMER RISK. OUR CUSTOMERS INCLUDE BUSINESSES OF MANY SIZES, GOVERNMENT AGENCIES, EDUCATIONAL INSTITUTIONS AND RESELLERS. WE\nMARKET AND SELL OUR SOFTWARE PRODUCTS AND SERVICES TO THESE CUSTOMERS WITH A SALES FORCE POSITIONED TO OFFER THE COMBINATIONS THAT BEST FIT THEIR NEEDS. WE ENABLE CUSTOMERS TO EVOLVE AND TRANSFORM TO SUBSTANTIALLY ANY IT ENVIRONMENT AT WHATEVER PACE\nIS MOST APPROPRIATE FOR THEM.\nTHE GROWTH IN OUR NEW SOFTWARE LICENSES AND OUR SAAS AND PAAS REVENUES THAT WE REPORT IS AFFECTED BY THE\nSTRENGTH OF GENERAL ECONOMIC AND BUSINESS CONDITIONS, GOVERNMENTAL BUDGETARY CONSTRAINTS, THE COMPETITIVE POSITION OF OUR SOFTWARE OFFERINGS, OUR ACQUISITIONS AND FOREIGN CURRENCY FLUCTUATIONS. THE SUBSTANTIAL MAJORITY OF OUR NEW SOFTWARE LICENSE\nTRANSACTIONS ARE CHARACTERIZED BY LONG SALES CYCLES AND THE TIMING OF A FEW LARGE SOFTWARE LICENSE TRANSACTIONS CAN SUBSTANTIALLY AFFECT OUR QUARTERLY NEW SOFTWARE LICENSES REVENUES. NEW SOFTWARE LICENSES AND CLOUD SOFTWARE SUBSCRIPTIONS REVENUES\nREPRESENTED 26% OF OUR TOTAL REVENUES IN FISCAL 2015 AND 28% IN EACH OF FISCAL 2014 AND 2013. OUR CLOUD SOFTWARE SUBSCRIPTIONS CONTRACTS, WHICH CONSIST OF SAAS AND PAAS ARRANGEMENTS, ARE GENERALLY ONE TO THREE YEARS IN DURATION AND WE STRIVE TO\nRENEW THESE CONTRACTS WHEN THEY ARE ELIGIBLE FOR RENEWAL. OUR NEW SOFTWARE LICENSES AND CLOUD SOFTWARE SUBSCRIPTIONS SEGMENT\u0092S MARGIN HAS HISTORICALLY TRENDED UPWARD OVER THE COURSE OF THE FOUR QUARTERS WITHIN A PARTICULAR FISCAL YEAR DUE TO\nTHE HISTORICAL\n38\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nUPWARD TREND OF OUR NEW SOFTWARE LICENSES REVENUES OVER THOSE QUARTERLY PERIODS AND BECAUSE THE MAJORITY OF OUR COSTS FOR THIS SEGMENT ARE PREDOMINANTLY FIXED IN THE SHORT-TERM. HOWEVER, OUR NEW\nSOFTWARE LICENSES AND CLOUD SOFTWARE SUBSCRIPTIONS SEGMENT\u0092S MARGIN HAS BEEN AND WILL CONTINUE TO BE AFFECTED BY THE FAIR VALUE ADJUSTMENTS RELATING TO THE CLOUD SAAS AND PAAS OBLIGATIONS THAT WE ASSUMED IN OUR BUSINESS COMBINATIONS (DESCRIBED\nFURTHER BELOW) AND BY THE AMORTIZATION OF INTANGIBLE ASSETS ASSOCIATED WITH COMPANIES AND TECHNOLOGIES THAT WE HAVE ACQUIRED.\nFOR CERTAIN OF\nOUR ACQUIRED BUSINESSES, WE RECORDED ADJUSTMENTS TO REDUCE THE CLOUD SAAS AND PAAS OBLIGATIONS TO THEIR ESTIMATED FAIR VALUES AT THE ACQUISITION DATES. AS A RESULT, AS REQUIRED BY BUSINESS COMBINATION ACCOUNTING RULES, WE DID NOT RECOGNIZE CLOUD\nSAAS AND PAAS REVENUES RELATED TO ACQUIRED CONTRACTS THAT WOULD HAVE BEEN OTHERWISE RECORDED BY THE ACQUIRED BUSINESSES AS INDEPENDENT ENTITIES IN THE AMOUNTS OF $12 MILLION, $17 MILLION AND $45 MILLION IN FISCAL 2015, 2014 AND 2013, RESPECTIVELY.\nTO THE EXTENT UNDERLYING CLOUD SAAS AND PAAS CONTRACTS ARE RENEWED WITH US FOLLOWING AN ACQUISITION, WE WILL RECOGNIZE THE REVENUES FOR THE FULL VALUES OF THESE CONTRACTS OVER THEIR RESPECTIVE CONTRACTUAL PERIODS.\nCLOUD INFRASTRUCTURE AS A SERVICE.\nOUR CLOUD INFRASTRUCTURE AS A SERVICE OFFERINGS, WHICH REPRESENTED 2% OF OUR TOTAL\nREVENUES IN FISCAL 2015 AND 1% IN EACH OF FISCAL 2014 AND 2013, PROVIDE COMPREHENSIVE SOFTWARE AND HARDWARE MANAGEMENT AND MAINTENANCE SERVICES FOR CUSTOMER IT INFRASTRUCTURE FOR A FEE FOR A STATED TERM THAT IS HOSTED AT OUR ORACLE DATA CENTER\nFACILITIES, SELECT PARTNER DATA CENTERS OR PHYSICALLY ON-PREMISES AT CUSTOMER FACILITIES; DEPLOYMENT AND MANAGEMENT OFFERINGS FOR OUR SOFTWARE AND HARDWARE AND RELATED IT INFRASTRUCTURE INCLUDING VIRTUAL MACHINE INSTANCES THAT ARE SUBSCRIPTION-BASED\nAND DESIGNED FOR COMPUTING AND RELIABLE AND SECURE OBJECT STORAGE; AND CERTAIN OF OUR ORACLE ENGINEERED SYSTEMS AND RELATED SUPPORT OFFERINGS THAT ARE DEPLOYED IN OUR CUSTOMERS\u0092 DATA CENTERS FOR A MONTHLY FEE.\nSOFTWARE LICENSE UPDATES AND PRODUCT SUPPORT.\nCUSTOMERS THAT PURCHASE SOFTWARE LICENSE UPDATES AND PRODUCT SUPPORT\nARE GRANTED RIGHTS TO UNSPECIFIED PRODUCT UPGRADES AND MAINTENANCE RELEASES AND PATCHES RELEASED DURING THE TERM OF THE SUPPORT PERIOD, AS WELL AS TECHNICAL SUPPORT ASSISTANCE. OUR SOFTWARE LICENSE UPDATES AND PRODUCT SUPPORT CONTRACTS ARE GENERALLY\nONE YEAR IN DURATION. SUBSTANTIALLY ALL OF OUR SOFTWARE LICENSE CUSTOMERS RENEW THEIR SOFTWARE LICENSE UPDATES AND PRODUCT SUPPORT CONTRACTS ANNUALLY. THE GROWTH OF SOFTWARE LICENSE UPDATES AND PRODUCT SUPPORT REVENUES IS PRIMARILY INFLUENCED BY\nTHREE FACTORS: (1) THE PERCENTAGE OF OUR SOFTWARE SUPPORT CONTRACT CUSTOMER BASE THAT RENEWS ITS SOFTWARE SUPPORT CONTRACTS, (2) THE AMOUNT OF NEW SOFTWARE SUPPORT CONTRACTS SOLD IN CONNECTION WITH THE SALE OF NEW SOFTWARE LICENSES AND\n(3) THE AMOUNT OF SOFTWARE SUPPORT CONTRACTS ASSUMED FROM COMPANIES WE HAVE ACQUIRED.\nSOFTWARE LICENSE UPDATES AND PRODUCT SUPPORT\nREVENUES, WHICH REPRESENTED 49%, 47% AND 46% OF OUR TOTAL REVENUES IN FISCAL 2015, 2014 AND 2013, RESPECTIVELY, IS OUR HIGHEST MARGIN BUSINESS UNIT. OUR SOFTWARE SUPPORT MARGINS DURING FISCAL 2015 WERE 90% AND ACCOUNTED FOR 81% OF OUR TOTAL MARGINS\nOVER THE SAME PERIOD. OUR SOFTWARE LICENSE UPDATES AND PRODUCT SUPPORT MARGINS HAVE BEEN AFFECTED BY FAIR VALUE ADJUSTMENTS RELATING TO SOFTWARE SUPPORT OBLIGATIONS ASSUMED IN BUSINESS COMBINATIONS (DESCRIBED FURTHER BELOW) AND BY AMORTIZATION OF\nINTANGIBLE ASSETS. HOWEVER, OVER THE LONGER TERM, WE BELIEVE THAT SOFTWARE LICENSE UPDATES AND PRODUCT SUPPORT REVENUES AND MARGINS WILL GROW FOR THE FOLLOWING REASONS.\n\u0095\nSUBSTANTIALLY ALL OF OUR CUSTOMERS, INCLUDING CUSTOMERS FROM ACQUIRED COMPANIES, RENEW THEIR SOFTWARE SUPPORT CONTRACTS WHEN ELIGIBLE FOR RENEWAL;\n\u0095\nSUBSTANTIALLY ALL OF OUR CUSTOMERS PURCHASE SOFTWARE LICENSE UPDATES AND PRODUCT SUPPORT CONTRACTS WHEN THEY BUY NEW SOFTWARE LICENSES, RESULTING IN A\nFURTHER INCREASE IN OUR SOFTWARE SUPPORT CONTRACT BASE. EVEN IF NEW SOFTWARE LICENSES REVENUES GROWTH WAS FLAT, SOFTWARE LICENSE UPDATES AND PRODUCT SUPPORT REVENUES WOULD CONTINUE TO GROW IN COMPARISON TO THE CORRESPONDING PRIOR YEAR PERIODS\nASSUMING CONTRACT RENEWAL AND CANCELLATION RATES AND FOREIGN CURRENCY RATES REMAINED RELATIVELY CONSTANT SINCE SUBSTANTIALLY ALL NEW SOFTWARE LICENSES TRANSACTIONS RESULT IN THE SALE OF SOFTWARE LICENSE UPDATES AND PRODUCT SUPPORT CONTRACTS, WHICH\nADD TO OUR SOFTWARE SUPPORT CONTRACT BASE; AND\n\u0095\nOUR ACQUISITIONS HAVE INCREASED OUR SOFTWARE SUPPORT CONTRACT BASE, AS WELL AS THE PORTFOLIO OF PRODUCTS AVAILABLE TO BE LICENSED AND SUPPORTED.\nWE RECORDED ADJUSTMENTS TO REDUCE SOFTWARE SUPPORT OBLIGATIONS ASSUMED IN BUSINESS COMBINATIONS TO THEIR ESTIMATED FAIR\nVALUES AT THE ACQUISITION DATES. AS A RESULT, AS REQUIRED BY BUSINESS COMBINATION ACCOUNTING RULES,\n39\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nWE DID NOT RECOGNIZE SOFTWARE LICENSE UPDATES AND PRODUCT SUPPORT REVENUES RELATED TO SOFTWARE SUPPORT CONTRACTS THAT WOULD HAVE BEEN OTHERWISE RECORDED BY THE ACQUIRED BUSINESSES AS INDEPENDENT\nENTITIES IN THE AMOUNTS OF $11 MILLION, $3 MILLION AND $14 MILLION IN FISCAL 2015, 2014 AND 2013, RESPECTIVELY. TO THE EXTENT UNDERLYING SOFTWARE SUPPORT CONTRACTS ARE RENEWED WITH US FOLLOWING AN ACQUISITION, WE WILL RECOGNIZE THE REVENUES FOR THE\nFULL VALUES OF THE SOFTWARE SUPPORT CONTRACTS OVER THE RESPECTIVE SUPPORT PERIODS, THE MAJORITY OF WHICH ARE ONE YEAR.\nHARDWARE\nSYSTEMS BUSINESS\nOUR HARDWARE SYSTEMS BUSINESS IS COMPRISED OF TWO OPERATING SEGMENTS: (1) HARDWARE SYSTEMS PRODUCTS AND\n(2) HARDWARE SYSTEMS SUPPORT. OUR HARDWARE BUSINESS REPRESENTED 14% OF OUR TOTAL REVENUES IN FISCAL 2015, 2014 AND 2013. WE EXPECT OUR HARDWARE BUSINESS TO HAVE LOWER OPERATING MARGINS AS A PERCENTAGE OF REVENUES THAN OUR SOFTWARE AND CLOUD\nBUSINESS DUE TO THE INCREMENTAL COSTS WE INCUR TO PRODUCE AND DISTRIBUTE THESE PRODUCTS AND TO PROVIDE SUPPORT SERVICES, INCLUDING DIRECT MATERIALS AND LABOR COSTS. WE EXPECT TO MAKE INVESTMENTS IN RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT TO IMPROVE EXISTING\nHARDWARE PRODUCTS AND SERVICES AND TO DEVELOP NEW HARDWARE PRODUCTS AND SERVICES.\nHARDWARE SYSTEMS\nPRODUCTS.\nWE PROVIDE A BROAD SELECTION OF HARDWARE SYSTEMS AND RELATED SERVICES INCLUDING ORACLE ENGINEERED SYSTEMS, SERVERS, STORAGE, NETWORKING, WORKSTATIONS AND RELATED DEVICES, INDUSTRY SPECIFIC HARDWARE,\nVIRTUALIZATION SOFTWARE, OPERATING SYSTEMS, AND MANAGEMENT SOFTWARE TO SUPPORT DIVERSE IT ENVIRONMENTS, INCLUDING CLOUD COMPUTING ENVIRONMENTS. WE ENGINEER OUR HARDWARE SYSTEMS WITH VIRTUALIZATION AND MANAGEMENT CAPABILITIES TO ENABLE THE RAPID\nDEPLOYMENT AND EFFICIENT MANAGEMENT OF CLOUD AND ON-PREMISES IT INFRASTRUCTURES. OUR HARDWARE PRODUCTS SUPPORT MANY OF THE WORLD\u0092S LARGEST CLOUD INFRASTRUCTURES, INCLUDING THE ORACLE CLOUD.\nOUR HARDWARE SYSTEMS PRODUCTS ARE DESIGNED TO BE EASIER TO DEPLOY, MANAGE AND MAINTAIN FOR OUR CUSTOMERS AND TO IMPROVE COMPUTING PERFORMANCE RELATIVE TO\nOUR COMPETITORS\u0092 OFFERINGS. WE DESIGN OUR HARDWARE PRODUCTS TO SEAMLESSLY CONNECT ON-PREMISES AND CLOUD IT ENVIRONMENTS TO FURTHER ENABLE INTEROPERABILITY, INTERCHANGEABILITY AND EXTENDIBILITY AND TO WORK IN CUSTOMER ENVIRONMENTS THAT MAY\nINCLUDE OTHER ORACLE OR NON-ORACLE HARDWARE OR SOFTWARE COMPONENTS. OUR FLEXIBLE AND OPEN APPROACH PROVIDES ORACLE CUSTOMERS WITH A BROAD RANGE OF CHOICES IN HOW THEY DEPLOY OUR HARDWARE PRODUCTS, WHICH WE BELIEVE IS A PRIORITY FOR OUR CUSTOMERS.\nORACLE ENGINEERED SYSTEMS ARE CORE TO OUR HARDWARE OFFERINGS AND ARE IMPORTANT ELEMENTS OF OUR DATA CENTER AND CLOUD COMPUTING OFFERINGS\nINCLUDING THE ORACLE CLOUD. THESE PRE-INTEGRATED PRODUCTS ARE DESIGNED TO INTEGRATE MULTIPLE ORACLE TECHNOLOGY COMPONENTS TO WORK TOGETHER TO DELIVER IMPROVED PERFORMANCE, AVAILABILITY, SECURITY AND OPERATIONAL EFFICIENCY RELATIVE TO OUR\nCOMPETITORS\u0092 PRODUCTS, TO BE UPGRADED EFFECTIVELY AND EFFICIENTLY AND TO SIMPLIFY MAINTENANCE CYCLES BY PROVIDING A SINGLE SOLUTION FOR SOFTWARE PATCHING. ORACLE ENGINEERED SYSTEMS ARE TESTED BEFORE THEY ARE SHIPPED TO CUSTOMERS AND DELIVERED\nREADY-TO-RUN, ENABLING CUSTOMERS TO SHORTEN THE TIME TO PRODUCTION.\nWE OFFER A WIDE RANGE OF SERVER SYSTEMS USING OUR SPARC MICROPROCESSOR.\nOUR SPARC SERVERS RUN THE ORACLE SOLARIS OPERATING SYSTEM AND ARE DESIGNED TO BE DIFFERENTIATED BY THEIR RELIABILITY, SECURITY, AND SCALABILITY. OUR MID-SIZE AND LARGE SERVERS ARE DESIGNED TO OFFER BETTER PERFORMANCE AND LOWER TOTAL COST OF\nOWNERSHIP THAN MAINFRAME SYSTEMS FOR BUSINESS CRITICAL APPLICATIONS, FOR CUSTOMERS HAVING MORE COMPUTATIONALLY INTENSIVE NEEDS, AND AS PLATFORMS FOR BUILDING CLOUD COMPUTING IT ENVIRONMENTS. OUR SPARC SERVERS ARE ALSO A CORE COMPONENT OF THE ORACLE\nSUPERCLUSTER, ONE OF OUR ORACLE ENGINEERED SYSTEMS.\nWE ALSO OFFER ENTERPRISE X86 SERVERS. THESE X86 SERVERS ARE BASED ON MICROPROCESSORS FROM\nINTEL CORPORATION AND ARE COMPATIBLE WITH ORACLE SOLARIS, ORACLE LINUX, MICROSOFT WINDOWS AND OTHER OPERATING SYSTEMS. OUR X86 SERVERS ARE ALSO A CORE COMPONENT OF MANY OF OUR ORACLE ENGINEERED SYSTEMS INCLUDING ORACLE EXADATA DATABASE MACHINE,\nORACLE EXALOGIC ELASTIC CLOUD, ORACLE EXALYTICS IN-MEMORY MACHINE AND THE ORACLE BIG DATA APPLIANCE.\nOUR STORAGE PRODUCTS ARE DESIGNED TO\nSECURELY MANAGE, PROTECT, ARCHIVE AND RESTORE CUSTOMERS\u0092 MISSION CRITICAL DATA ASSETS AND CONSIST OF TAPE, DISK, FLASH AND HARDWARE-RELATED SOFTWARE INCLUDING FILE SYSTEMS SOFTWARE, BACK-UP AND ARCHIVE SOFTWARE AND STORAGE MANAGEMENT SOFTWARE\nAND NETWORKING FOR MAINFRAME AND OPEN SYSTEMS ENVIRONMENTS.\n40\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nOUR NETWORKING AND DATA CENTER FABRIC PRODUCTS, INCLUDING ORACLE VIRTUAL NETWORKING, AND ORACLE INFINIBAND\nAND ETHERNET TECHNOLOGIES, ARE USED WITH OUR SERVER AND STORAGE PRODUCTS AND ARE INTEGRATED INTO OUR MANAGEMENT TOOLS TO HELP ENTERPRISE CUSTOMERS IMPROVE INFRASTRUCTURE PERFORMANCE, REDUCE COST AND COMPLEXITY AND SIMPLIFY STORAGE AND SERVER\nCONNECTIVITY.\nWE OFFER HARDWARE PRODUCTS AND SERVICES DESIGNED FOR SPECIFIC INDUSTRIES. OUR POINT-OF-SALE HARDWARE OFFERINGS INCLUDE\nPOINT-OF-SALE TERMINALS AND RELATED HARDWARE THAT ARE DESIGNED FOR MANAGING BUSINESSES WITHIN THE FOOD AND BEVERAGE, HOTEL AND RETAIL INDUSTRIES, AMONG OTHERS. OUR HARDWARE PRODUCTS AND SERVICES FOR COMMUNICATIONS NETWORKS INCLUDE NETWORK SIGNALING,\nPOLICY CONTROL AND SUBSCRIBER DATA MANAGEMENT SOLUTIONS, AND SESSION BORDER CONTROL TECHNOLOGY, AMONG OTHERS.\nTHE MAJORITY OF OUR HARDWARE\nSYSTEMS PRODUCTS ARE SOLD THROUGH INDIRECT CHANNELS, INCLUDING INDEPENDENT DISTRIBUTORS AND VALUE ADDED RESELLERS.\nTO PRODUCE OUR HARDWARE\nPRODUCTS, WE RELY ON BOTH OUR INTERNAL MANUFACTURING OPERATIONS AS WELL AS THIRD PARTY MANUFACTURING PARTNERS. OUR INTERNAL MANUFACTURING OPERATIONS CONSIST PRIMARILY OF MATERIALS PROCUREMENT, ASSEMBLY, TESTING AND QUALITY CONTROL OF OUR ORACLE\nENGINEERED SYSTEMS AND CERTAIN OF OUR ENTERPRISE AND DATA CENTER SERVERS AND STORAGE SYSTEMS. FOR ALL OTHER MANUFACTURING, WE GENERALLY RELY ON THIRD PARTY MANUFACTURING PARTNERS TO PRODUCE OUR HARDWARE RELATED COMPONENTS AND HARDWARE PRODUCTS AND\nWE MAY INVOLVE OUR INTERNAL MANUFACTURING OPERATIONS IN THE FINAL ASSEMBLY, TESTING AND QUALITY CONTROL PROCESSES FOR THESE COMPONENTS AND PRODUCTS. WE DISTRIBUTE MOST OF OUR HARDWARE PRODUCTS EITHER FROM OUR FACILITIES OR PARTNER FACILITIES. WE\nSTRIVE TO REDUCE COSTS BY SIMPLIFYING OUR MANUFACTURING PROCESSES THROUGH INCREASED STANDARDIZATION OF COMPONENTS ACROSS PRODUCT TYPES AND A \u0093BUILD-TO-ORDER\u0094 MANUFACTURING PROCESS IN WHICH PRODUCTS GENERALLY ARE BUILT ONLY AFTER CUSTOMERS\nHAVE PLACED FIRM ORDERS.\nOUR HARDWARE SYSTEMS PRODUCTS REVENUES, COST OF HARDWARE SYSTEMS PRODUCTS AND HARDWARE SYSTEMS OPERATING MARGINS THAT\nWE REPORT ARE AFFECTED BY OUR STRATEGY FOR AND THE COMPETITIVE POSITION OF OUR HARDWARE SYSTEMS PRODUCTS, THE STRENGTH OF GENERAL ECONOMIC AND BUSINESS CONDITIONS, GOVERNMENTAL BUDGETARY CONSTRAINTS, CERTAIN OF OUR ACQUISITIONS AND FOREIGN CURRENCY\nRATE FLUCTUATIONS. IN ADDITION, OUR OPERATING MARGINS FOR OUR HARDWARE SYSTEMS PRODUCTS SEGMENT HAVE BEEN AND WILL BE AFFECTED BY THE AMORTIZATION OF INTANGIBLE ASSETS.\nOUR QUARTERLY HARDWARE SYSTEMS PRODUCTS REVENUES ARE DIFFICULT TO PREDICT. THE TIMING OF CUSTOMER ORDERS AND DELAYS IN OUR ABILITY TO TIMELY MANUFACTURE OR DELIVER A FEW LARGE HARDWARE TRANSACTIONS, AMONG\nOTHER FACTORS, COULD SUBSTANTIALLY AFFECT THE AMOUNT OF HARDWARE SYSTEMS PRODUCTS REVENUES, EXPENSES AND OPERATING MARGINS THAT WE REPORT.\nHARDWARE SYSTEMS SUPPORT.\nOUR HARDWARE SYSTEMS SUPPORT OFFERINGS PROVIDE CUSTOMERS WITH SOFTWARE UPDATES FOR SOFTWARE\nCOMPONENTS THAT ARE ESSENTIAL TO THE FUNCTIONALITY OF OUR HARDWARE PRODUCTS, SUCH AS ORACLE SOLARIS AND CERTAIN OTHER SOFTWARE PRODUCTS, AND CAN INCLUDE PRODUCT REPAIRS, MAINTENANCE SERVICES AND TECHNICAL SUPPORT SERVICES. TYPICALLY, OUR HARDWARE\nSYSTEMS SUPPORT CONTRACT ARRANGEMENTS ARE PRICED AS A PERCENTAGE OF THE NET HARDWARE SYSTEMS PRODUCTS FEES, ARE INVOICED TO THE CUSTOMER AT THE BEGINNING OF THE SUPPORT PERIOD AND ARE ONE YEAR IN DURATION. WE CONTINUE TO EVOLVE HARDWARE SYSTEMS\nSUPPORT PROCESSES THAT ARE INTENDED TO PROACTIVELY IDENTIFY AND SOLVE QUALITY ISSUES AND TO INCREASE THE AMOUNT OF NEW AND RENEWED HARDWARE SYSTEMS SUPPORT CONTRACTS SOLD IN CONNECTION WITH THE SALES OF OUR HARDWARE SYSTEMS PRODUCTS. OUR HARDWARE\nSYSTEMS SUPPORT REVENUES THAT WE REPORT ARE INFLUENCED BY A NUMBER OF FACTORS, INCLUDING THE VOLUME OF PURCHASES OF HARDWARE PRODUCTS, THE MIX OF HARDWARE PRODUCTS PURCHASED, WHETHER CUSTOMERS DECIDE TO PURCHASE HARDWARE SYSTEMS SUPPORT CONTRACTS AT\nOR IN CLOSE PROXIMITY TO THE TIME OF HARDWARE PRODUCT SALE, THE PERCENTAGE OF OUR HARDWARE SYSTEMS SUPPORT CONTRACT CUSTOMER BASE THAT RENEWS ITS SUPPORT CONTRACTS AND OUR ACQUISITIONS. SUBSTANTIALLY ALL OF THESE FACTORS ARE HEAVILY INFLUENCED BY\nOUR CUSTOMERS\u0092 DECISIONS TO EITHER MAINTAIN OR UPGRADE THEIR EXISTING HARDWARE SYSTEMS\u0092 INFRASTRUCTURE TO NEWLY DEVELOPED TECHNOLOGIES THAT ARE AVAILABLE.\nOUR HARDWARE SYSTEMS SUPPORT MARGINS HAVE BEEN AND WILL BE AFFECTED BY CERTAIN OF OUR ACQUISITIONS AND RELATED ACCOUNTING, INCLUDING FAIR VALUE ADJUSTMENTS RELATING TO HARDWARE SYSTEMS SUPPORT OBLIGATIONS\nASSUMED, AND BY THE AMORTIZATION OF INTANGIBLE ASSETS. AS REQUIRED BY BUSINESS COMBINATION ACCOUNTING RULES, WE RECORDED ADJUSTMENTS TO REDUCE OUR HARDWARE SYSTEMS SUPPORT REVENUES FOR CONTRACTS ASSUMED FROM OUR ACQUISITIONS TO THEIR ESTIMATED FAIR\nVALUES. THESE AMOUNTS WOULD HAVE BEEN RECORDED AS HARDWARE SYSTEMS SUPPORT REVENUES BY\n41\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nTHE ACQUIRED BUSINESSES AS INDEPENDENT ENTITIES IN THE AMOUNTS OF $4 MILLION, $11 MILLION AND $14 MILLION FOR FISCAL 2015, 2014 AND 2013, RESPECTIVELY. TO THE EXTENT UNDERLYING HARDWARE SYSTEMS\nSUPPORT CONTRACTS ARE RENEWED WITH US FOLLOWING AN ACQUISITION, WE WILL RECOGNIZE THE REVENUES FOR THE FULL VALUES OF THE HARDWARE SYSTEMS SUPPORT CONTRACTS OVER THE RESPECTIVE SUPPORT PERIODS.\nSERVICES BUSINESS\nOUR\nSERVICES BUSINESS, WHICH REPRESENTED 9%, 10% AND 11% OF OUR TOTAL REVENUES IN FISCAL 2015, FISCAL 2014 AND FISCAL 2013, RESPECTIVELY, IS COMPRISED OF THE REMAINDER OF OUR OPERATING SEGMENTS. OUR SERVICES BUSINESS HAS LOWER MARGINS THAN OUR SOFTWARE\nAND CLOUD AND HARDWARE BUSINESSES. OUR SERVICES REVENUES ARE IMPACTED BY OUR STRATEGY FOR AND THE COMPETITIVE POSITION OF OUR SERVICES, CERTAIN OF OUR ACQUISITIONS, GENERAL ECONOMIC CONDITIONS, GOVERNMENTAL BUDGETARY CONSTRAINTS, PERSONNEL\nREDUCTIONS IN OUR CUSTOMERS\u0092 IT DEPARTMENTS, TIGHTER CONTROLS OVER DISCRETIONARY SPENDING AND THE GROWTH IN OUR SOFTWARE AND HARDWARE SYSTEMS PRODUCTS REVENUES. OUR SERVICES BUSINESS\u0092 OFFERINGS INCLUDE.\n\u0095\nCONSULTING SERVICES THAT ARE DESIGNED TO HELP OUR CUSTOMERS AND GLOBAL SYSTEM INTEGRATOR PARTNERS MORE SUCCESSFULLY ARCHITECT AND DEPLOY OUR PRODUCTS,\nINCLUDING IT STRATEGY ALIGNMENT, ENTERPRISE ARCHITECTURE PLANNING AND DESIGN, INITIAL PRODUCT IMPLEMENTATION AND INTEGRATION, AND ONGOING PRODUCT ENHANCEMENTS AND UPGRADES. WE UTILIZE A GLOBAL, BLENDED DELIVERY MODEL TO OPTIMIZE VALUE FOR OUR\nCUSTOMERS AND PARTNERS, CONSISTING OF ON-PREMISES CONSULTANTS FROM LOCAL GEOGRAPHIES, INDUSTRY SPECIALISTS AND CONSULTANTS FROM OUR GLOBAL DELIVERY AND SOLUTION CENTERS;\n\u0095\nADVANCED CUSTOMER SUPPORT SERVICES, WHICH ARE PROVIDED ON-PREMISES AND REMOTELY TO OUR CUSTOMERS TO ENABLE INCREASED PERFORMANCE AND HIGHER\nAVAILABILITY OF THEIR ORACLE PRODUCTS AND SERVICES; AND\n\u0095\nEDUCATION SERVICES FOR ORACLE PRODUCTS AND SERVICES, INCLUDING TRAINING AND CERTIFICATION PROGRAMS THAT ARE OFFERED TO CUSTOMERS, PARTNERS AND\nEMPLOYEES THROUGH A VARIETY OF FORMATS, INCLUDING INSTRUCTOR-LED CLASSES AT OUR EDUCATION CENTERS, LIVE VIRTUAL TRAINING, SELF-PACED ONLINE TRAINING, PRIVATE EVENTS AND CUSTOM TRAINING.\nACQUISITIONS\nA SELECTIVE\nAND ACTIVE ACQUISITION PROGRAM IS ANOTHER IMPORTANT ELEMENT OF OUR CORPORATE STRATEGY. IN RECENT YEARS, WE HAVE INVESTED BILLIONS OF DOLLARS TO ACQUIRE A NUMBER OF COMPLEMENTARY COMPANIES, PRODUCTS, SERVICES AND TECHNOLOGIES INCLUDING MICROS\nSYSTEMS, INC. (MICROS) IN FISCAL 2015, RESPONSYS, INC. (RESPONSYS) AND TEKELEC GLOBAL, INC. (TEKELEC) IN FISCAL 2014, AND ACME PACKET, INC. (ACME PACKET) IN FISCAL 2013, AMONG OTHERS. WE BELIEVE OUR ACQUISITION PROGRAM STRENGTHENS OUR COMPETITIVE\nPOSITION, ENHANCES THE PRODUCTS AND SERVICES THAT WE CAN OFFER TO CUSTOMERS, EXPANDS OUR CUSTOMER BASE, PROVIDES GREATER SCALE TO ACCELERATE INNOVATION, GROWS OUR REVENUES AND EARNINGS AND INCREASES STOCKHOLDER VALUE. WE EXPECT TO CONTINUE TO\nACQUIRE COMPANIES, PRODUCTS, SERVICES AND TECHNOLOGIES IN FURTHERANCE OF OUR CORPORATE STRATEGY. NOTE 2 OF NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS INCLUDED ELSEWHERE IN THIS ANNUAL REPORT PROVIDES ADDITIONAL INFORMATION RELATED TO OUR RECENT\nACQUISITIONS.\nWE BELIEVE WE CAN FUND OUR FUTURE ACQUISITIONS WITH OUR INTERNALLY AVAILABLE CASH, CASH EQUIVALENTS AND MARKETABLE SECURITIES,\nCASH GENERATED FROM OPERATIONS, ADDITIONAL BORROWINGS OR FROM THE ISSUANCE OF ADDITIONAL SECURITIES. WE ESTIMATE THE FINANCIAL IMPACT OF ANY POTENTIAL ACQUISITION WITH REGARD TO EARNINGS, OPERATING MARGIN, CASH FLOW AND RETURN ON INVESTED CAPITAL\nTARGETS BEFORE DECIDING TO MOVE FORWARD WITH AN ACQUISITION.\nCRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES\nOUR CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS ARE PREPARED IN ACCORDANCE WITH U.S. GENERALLY ACCEPTED ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES (GAAP) AS SET FORTH IN THE FINANCIAL\nACCOUNTING STANDARDS BOARD\u0092S (FASB) ACCOUNTING STANDARDS CODIFICATION (ASC) AND WE CONSIDER THE VARIOUS STAFF ACCOUNTING BULLETINS AND OTHER APPLICABLE GUIDANCE ISSUED BY THE UNITED STATES SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION (SEC). GAAP, AS SET\nFORTH WITHIN THE ASC, REQUIRES US TO MAKE CERTAIN ESTIMATES, JUDGMENTS AND ASSUMPTIONS. WE BELIEVE THAT THE ESTIMATES, JUDGMENTS AND ASSUMPTIONS UPON WHICH WE RELY ARE REASONABLE BASED UPON INFORMATION AVAILABLE TO US AT THE TIME THAT THESE\n42\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nESTIMATES, JUDGMENTS AND ASSUMPTIONS ARE MADE. THESE ESTIMATES, JUDGMENTS AND ASSUMPTIONS CAN AFFECT THE REPORTED AMOUNTS OF ASSETS AND LIABILITIES AS OF THE DATE OF THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AS\nWELL AS THE REPORTED AMOUNTS OF REVENUES AND EXPENSES DURING THE PERIODS PRESENTED. TO THE EXTENT THERE ARE DIFFERENCES BETWEEN THESE ESTIMATES, JUDGMENTS OR ASSUMPTIONS AND ACTUAL RESULTS, OUR FINANCIAL STATEMENTS WILL BE AFFECTED. THE ACCOUNTING\nPOLICIES THAT REFLECT OUR MORE SIGNIFICANT ESTIMATES, JUDGMENTS AND ASSUMPTIONS AND WHICH WE BELIEVE ARE THE MOST CRITICAL TO AID IN FULLY UNDERSTANDING AND EVALUATING OUR REPORTED FINANCIAL RESULTS INCLUDE THE FOLLOWING.\n\u0095\nREVENUE RECOGNITION\n\u0095\nBUSINESS COMBINATIONS\n\u0095\nGOODWILL AND INTANGIBLE ASSETS\u0097IMPAIRMENT ASSESSMENTS\n\u0095\nACCOUNTING FOR INCOME TAXES\n\u0095\nLEGAL AND OTHER CONTINGENCIES\n\u0095\nSTOCK-BASED COMPENSATION\nIN MANY CASES, THE ACCOUNTING TREATMENT OF A PARTICULAR TRANSACTION IS SPECIFICALLY DICTATED BY GAAP AND DOES NOT REQUIRE MANAGEMENT\u0092S JUDGMENT IN\nITS APPLICATION. THERE ARE ALSO AREAS IN WHICH MANAGEMENT\u0092S JUDGMENT IN SELECTING AMONG AVAILABLE ALTERNATIVES WOULD NOT PRODUCE A MATERIALLY DIFFERENT RESULT. OUR SENIOR MANAGEMENT HAS REVIEWED OUR CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND RELATED\nDISCLOSURES WITH THE FINANCE AND AUDIT COMMITTEE OF THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS.\nREVENUE RECOGNITION\nOUR SOURCES OF REVENUES INCLUDE: (1) SOFTWARE AND CLOUD REVENUES, INCLUDING NEW SOFTWARE LICENSES REVENUES EARNED FROM GRANTING LICENSES TO USE OUR\nSOFTWARE PRODUCTS AND INDUSTRY SPECIFIC SOFTWARE; CLOUD SAAS AND PAAS REVENUES GENERATED FROM FEES FOR GRANTING CUSTOMERS ACCESS TO A BROAD RANGE OF OUR SOFTWARE AND RELATED SUPPORT OFFERINGS ON A SUBSCRIPTION BASIS IN A SECURE, STANDARDS-BASED\nCLOUD COMPUTING ENVIRONMENT; CLOUD IAAS REVENUES GENERATED FROM FEES FOR DEPLOYMENT AND MANAGEMENT OFFERINGS FOR OUR SOFTWARE AND HARDWARE AND RELATED IT INFRASTRUCTURE GENERALLY ON A SUBSCRIPTION BASIS; AND SOFTWARE LICENSE UPDATES AND PRODUCT\nSUPPORT REVENUES (DESCRIBED FURTHER BELOW); (2) HARDWARE SYSTEMS REVENUES, WHICH INCLUDE THE SALE OF HARDWARE SYSTEMS PRODUCTS INCLUDING ORACLE ENGINEERED SYSTEMS, COMPUTER SERVERS, STORAGE PRODUCTS, NETWORKING AND DATA CENTER FABRIC PRODUCTS,\nAND INDUSTRY SPECIFIC HARDWARE; AND HARDWARE SYSTEMS SUPPORT REVENUES; AND (3) SERVICES, WHICH INCLUDE SOFTWARE AND HARDWARE RELATED SERVICES INCLUDING CONSULTING, ADVANCED CUSTOMER SUPPORT AND EDUCATION REVENUES. REVENUES GENERALLY ARE\nRECOGNIZED NET OF ANY TAXES COLLECTED FROM CUSTOMERS AND SUBSEQUENTLY REMITTED TO GOVERNMENTAL AUTHORITIES.\nREVENUE RECOGNITION FOR\nSOFTWARE PRODUCTS AND SOFTWARE RELATED SERVICES (SOFTWARE ELEMENTS)\nNEW SOFTWARE LICENSES REVENUES PRIMARILY REPRESENT FEES EARNED FROM\nGRANTING CUSTOMERS LICENSES TO USE OUR DATABASE, MIDDLEWARE AND APPLICATION SOFTWARE AND EXCLUDE CLOUD SAAS AND PAAS REVENUES AND REVENUES DERIVED FROM SOFTWARE LICENSE UPDATES, WHICH ARE INCLUDED IN SOFTWARE LICENSE UPDATES AND PRODUCT SUPPORT\nREVENUES. THE BASIS FOR OUR NEW SOFTWARE LICENSES REVENUE RECOGNITION IS SUBSTANTIALLY GOVERNED BY THE ACCOUNTING GUIDANCE CONTAINED IN ASC 985-605,\nSOFTWARE-REVENUE RECOGNITION.\nWE EXERCISE JUDGMENT AND USE ESTIMATES IN CONNECTION WITH THE\nDETERMINATION OF THE AMOUNT OF SOFTWARE AND SOFTWARE RELATED SERVICES REVENUES TO BE RECOGNIZED IN EACH ACCOUNTING PERIOD.\nFOR SOFTWARE\nLICENSE ARRANGEMENTS THAT DO NOT REQUIRE SIGNIFICANT MODIFICATION OR CUSTOMIZATION OF THE UNDERLYING SOFTWARE, WE RECOGNIZE NEW SOFTWARE LICENSES REVENUES WHEN: (1) WE ENTER INTO A LEGALLY BINDING ARRANGEMENT WITH A CUSTOMER FOR THE LICENSE OF\nSOFTWARE; (2) WE DELIVER THE PRODUCTS; (3) THE SALE PRICE IS FIXED OR DETERMINABLE AND FREE OF CONTINGENCIES OR SIGNIFICANT UNCERTAINTIES; AND (4) COLLECTION IS PROBABLE. REVENUES THAT ARE NOT RECOGNIZED AT THE TIME OF SALE BECAUSE\nTHE FOREGOING CONDITIONS ARE NOT MET, ARE RECOGNIZED WHEN THOSE CONDITIONS ARE SUBSEQUENTLY MET.\nSUBSTANTIALLY ALL OF OUR SOFTWARE LICENSE\nARRANGEMENTS DO NOT INCLUDE ACCEPTANCE PROVISIONS. HOWEVER, IF ACCEPTANCE PROVISIONS EXIST AS PART OF PUBLIC POLICY, FOR EXAMPLE, IN AGREEMENTS WITH GOVERNMENT ENTITIES WHERE\n43\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nACCEPTANCE PERIODS ARE REQUIRED BY LAW, OR WITHIN PREVIOUSLY EXECUTED TERMS AND CONDITIONS THAT ARE REFERENCED IN THE CURRENT AGREEMENT AND ARE SHORT-TERM IN NATURE, WE GENERALLY RECOGNIZE\nREVENUES UPON DELIVERY PROVIDED THE ACCEPTANCE TERMS ARE PERFUNCTORY AND ALL OTHER REVENUE RECOGNITION CRITERIA HAVE BEEN MET. IF ACCEPTANCE PROVISIONS ARE NOT PERFUNCTORY (FOR EXAMPLE, ACCEPTANCE PROVISIONS THAT ARE LONG-TERM IN NATURE OR ARE NOT\nINCLUDED AS STANDARD TERMS OF AN ARRANGEMENT), REVENUES ARE RECOGNIZED UPON THE EARLIER OF RECEIPT OF WRITTEN CUSTOMER ACCEPTANCE OR EXPIRATION OF THE ACCEPTANCE PERIOD.\nTHE VAST MAJORITY OF OUR SOFTWARE LICENSE ARRANGEMENTS INCLUDE SOFTWARE LICENSE UPDATES AND PRODUCT SUPPORT CONTRACTS, WHICH ARE ENTERED INTO AT THE CUSTOMER\u0092S OPTION AND ARE RECOGNIZED RATABLY OVER\nTHE TERM OF THE ARRANGEMENT, TYPICALLY ONE YEAR. SOFTWARE LICENSE UPDATES PROVIDE CUSTOMERS WITH RIGHTS TO UNSPECIFIED SOFTWARE PRODUCT UPGRADES, MAINTENANCE RELEASES AND PATCHES RELEASED DURING THE TERM OF THE SUPPORT PERIOD. PRODUCT SUPPORT\nINCLUDES INTERNET ACCESS TO TECHNICAL CONTENT, AS WELL AS INTERNET AND TELEPHONE ACCESS TO TECHNICAL SUPPORT PERSONNEL. SOFTWARE LICENSE UPDATES AND PRODUCT SUPPORT CONTRACTS ARE GENERALLY PRICED AS A PERCENTAGE OF THE NET NEW SOFTWARE LICENSES\nFEES. SUBSTANTIALLY ALL OF OUR CUSTOMERS RENEW THEIR SOFTWARE LICENSE UPDATES AND PRODUCT SUPPORT CONTRACTS ANNUALLY.\nREVENUE RECOGNITION\nFOR MULTIPLE-ELEMENT ARRANGEMENTS\n\u0097\nSOFTWARE PRODUCTS AND SOFTWARE RELATED SERVICES (SOFTWARE ARRANGEMENTS)\nWE OFTEN ENTER INTO\nARRANGEMENTS WITH CUSTOMERS THAT PURCHASE BOTH SOFTWARE RELATED PRODUCTS AND SOFTWARE RELATED SERVICES FROM US AT THE SAME TIME, OR WITHIN CLOSE PROXIMITY OF ONE ANOTHER (REFERRED TO AS SOFTWARE RELATED MULTIPLE-ELEMENT ARRANGEMENTS). SUCH SOFTWARE\nRELATED MULTIPLE-ELEMENT ARRANGEMENTS INCLUDE THE SALE OF OUR SOFTWARE PRODUCTS, SOFTWARE LICENSE UPDATES AND PRODUCT SUPPORT CONTRACTS AND OTHER SOFTWARE RELATED SERVICES WHEREBY SOFTWARE LICENSE DELIVERY IS FOLLOWED BY THE SUBSEQUENT OR\nCONTEMPORANEOUS DELIVERY OF THE OTHER ELEMENTS. FOR THOSE SOFTWARE RELATED MULTIPLE-ELEMENT ARRANGEMENTS, WE HAVE APPLIED THE RESIDUAL METHOD TO DETERMINE THE AMOUNT OF NEW SOFTWARE LICENSE REVENUES TO BE RECOGNIZED PURSUANT TO ASC 985-605. UNDER\nTHE RESIDUAL METHOD, IF FAIR VALUE EXISTS FOR UNDELIVERED ELEMENTS IN A MULTIPLE-ELEMENT ARRANGEMENT, SUCH FAIR VALUE OF THE UNDELIVERED ELEMENTS IS DEFERRED WITH THE REMAINING PORTION OF THE ARRANGEMENT CONSIDERATION GENERALLY RECOGNIZED UPON\nDELIVERY OF THE SOFTWARE LICENSE. WE ALLOCATE THE FAIR VALUE OF EACH ELEMENT OF A SOFTWARE RELATED MULTIPLE-ELEMENT ARRANGEMENT BASED UPON ITS FAIR VALUE AS DETERMINED BY OUR VENDOR SPECIFIC OBJECTIVE EVIDENCE (VSOE\u0097DESCRIBED FURTHER BELOW),\nWITH ANY REMAINING AMOUNT ALLOCATED TO THE SOFTWARE LICENSE.\nREVENUE RECOGNITION FOR CLOUD SAAS, PAAS AND IAAS OFFERINGS, HARDWARE SYSTEMS\nPRODUCTS, HARDWARE SYSTEMS SUPPORT AND RELATED SERVICES (NONSOFTWARE ELEMENTS)\nOUR REVENUE RECOGNITION POLICY FOR NONSOFTWARE DELIVERABLES\nINCLUDING CLOUD SAAS, PAAS AND IAAS OFFERINGS, HARDWARE SYSTEMS PRODUCTS, SUPPORT AND RELATED SERVICES IS BASED UPON THE ACCOUNTING GUIDANCE CONTAINED IN ASC 605-25,\nREVENUE RECOGNITION\n,\nMULTIPLE-ELEMENT ARRANGEMENTS,\nAND WE EXERCISE\nJUDGMENT AND USE ESTIMATES IN CONNECTION WITH THE DETERMINATION OF THE AMOUNT OF CLOUD SAAS, PAAS AND IAAS REVENUES, HARDWARE SYSTEMS PRODUCTS REVENUES, SUPPORT AND RELATED SERVICES REVENUES TO BE RECOGNIZED IN EACH ACCOUNTING PERIOD.\nREVENUES FROM THE SALES OF OUR NONSOFTWARE ELEMENTS ARE RECOGNIZED WHEN: (1) PERSUASIVE EVIDENCE OF AN ARRANGEMENT EXISTS; (2) WE DELIVER THE\nPRODUCTS AND PASSAGE OF THE TITLE TO THE BUYER OCCURS; (3) THE SALE PRICE IS FIXED OR DETERMINABLE; AND (4) COLLECTION IS REASONABLY ASSURED. REVENUES THAT ARE NOT RECOGNIZED AT THE TIME OF SALE BECAUSE THE FOREGOING CONDITIONS ARE NOT MET\nARE RECOGNIZED WHEN THOSE CONDITIONS ARE SUBSEQUENTLY MET. WHEN APPLICABLE, WE REDUCE REVENUES FOR ESTIMATED RETURNS OR CERTAIN OTHER INCENTIVE PROGRAMS WHERE WE HAVE THE ABILITY TO SUFFICIENTLY ESTIMATE THE EFFECTS OF THESE ITEMS. WHERE AN\nARRANGEMENT IS SUBJECT TO ACCEPTANCE CRITERIA AND THE ACCEPTANCE PROVISIONS ARE NOT PERFUNCTORY (FOR EXAMPLE, ACCEPTANCE PROVISIONS THAT ARE LONG-TERM IN NATURE OR ARE NOT INCLUDED AS STANDARD TERMS OF AN ARRANGEMENT), REVENUES ARE RECOGNIZED UPON\nTHE EARLIER OF RECEIPT OF WRITTEN CUSTOMER ACCEPTANCE OR EXPIRATION OF THE ACCEPTANCE PERIOD.\nOUR CLOUD SAAS AND PAAS OFFERINGS GENERALLY\nPROVIDE CUSTOMERS ACCESS TO CERTAIN OF OUR SOFTWARE WITHIN A CLOUD-BASED IT ENVIRONMENT THAT WE MANAGE, HOST AND SUPPORT AND OFFER TO CUSTOMERS ON A SUBSCRIPTION BASIS. REVENUES FOR OUR CLOUD SAAS AND PAAS OFFERINGS ARE GENERALLY RECOGNIZED RATABLY\nOVER THE CONTRACT TERM COMMENCING WITH THE DATE THE SERVICE IS MADE AVAILABLE TO CUSTOMERS AND ALL OTHER REVENUE RECOGNITION CRITERIA HAVE BEEN SATISFIED.\n44\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nOUR CLOUD IAAS OFFERINGS PROVIDE DEPLOYMENT AND MANAGEMENT OFFERINGS FOR OUR SOFTWARE AND HARDWARE AND\nRELATED IT INFRASTRUCTURE INCLUDING COMPREHENSIVE SOFTWARE AND HARDWARE MANAGEMENT AND MAINTENANCE SERVICES ARRANGEMENTS FOR CUSTOMER IT INFRASTRUCTURE FOR A STATED TERM THAT IS HOSTED AT OUR DATA CENTER FACILITIES, SELECT PARTNER DATA CENTERS OR\nPHYSICALLY ON-PREMISES AT CUSTOMER FACILITIES GENERALLY FOR A TERM-BASED FEE; AND VIRTUAL MACHINE INSTANCES THAT ARE SUBSCRIPTION-BASED AND DESIGNED FOR COMPUTING AND RELIABLE AND SECURE OBJECT STORAGE. REVENUES FOR THESE CLOUD IAAS OFFERINGS ARE\nGENERALLY RECOGNIZED RATABLY OVER THE CONTRACT TERM COMMENCING WITH THE DATE THE SERVICE IS MADE AVAILABLE TO CUSTOMERS AND ALL OTHER REVENUE RECOGNITION CRITERIA HAVE BEEN SATISFIED.\nREVENUES FROM THE SALE OF HARDWARE SYSTEMS PRODUCTS REPRESENT AMOUNTS EARNED PRIMARILY FROM THE SALE OF OUR ORACLE ENGINEERED SYSTEMS, COMPUTER SERVERS, STORAGE, NETWORKING AND INDUSTRY SPECIFIC HARDWARE.\nOUR HARDWARE SYSTEMS SUPPORT OFFERINGS GENERALLY PROVIDE CUSTOMERS WITH SOFTWARE UPDATES FOR THE SOFTWARE COMPONENTS THAT ARE ESSENTIAL TO THE\nFUNCTIONALITY OF OUR HARDWARE PRODUCTS AND CAN ALSO INCLUDE PRODUCT REPAIRS, MAINTENANCE SERVICES AND TECHNICAL SUPPORT SERVICES. HARDWARE SYSTEMS SUPPORT CONTRACTS ARE GENERALLY PRICED AS A PERCENTAGE OF THE NET HARDWARE SYSTEMS PRODUCTS FEES.\nHARDWARE SYSTEMS SUPPORT CONTRACTS ARE ENTERED INTO AT THE CUSTOMER\u0092S OPTION AND ARE RECOGNIZED RATABLY OVER THE CONTRACTUAL TERM OF THE ARRANGEMENTS, WHICH ARE TYPICALLY ONE YEAR.\nREVENUE RECOGNITION FOR MULTIPLE-ELEMENT ARRANGEMENTS\u0097CLOUD SAAS, PAAS AND IAAS OFFERINGS, HARDWARE SYSTEMS PRODUCTS, HARDWARE SYSTEMS SUPPORT AND RELATED SERVICES (NONSOFTWARE ARRANGEMENTS)\nWE ENTER INTO ARRANGEMENTS WITH CUSTOMERS THAT PURCHASE BOTH NONSOFTWARE RELATED PRODUCTS AND SERVICES FROM US AT THE SAME TIME, OR WITHIN\nCLOSE PROXIMITY OF ONE ANOTHER (REFERRED TO AS NONSOFTWARE MULTIPLE-ELEMENT ARRANGEMENTS). EACH ELEMENT WITHIN A NONSOFTWARE MULTIPLE-ELEMENT ARRANGEMENT IS ACCOUNTED FOR AS A SEPARATE UNIT OF ACCOUNTING PROVIDED THE FOLLOWING CRITERIA ARE MET: THE\nDELIVERED PRODUCTS OR SERVICES HAVE VALUE TO THE CUSTOMER ON A STANDALONE BASIS; AND FOR AN ARRANGEMENT THAT INCLUDES A GENERAL RIGHT OF RETURN RELATIVE TO THE DELIVERED PRODUCTS OR SERVICES, DELIVERY OR PERFORMANCE OF THE UNDELIVERED PRODUCT OR\nSERVICE IS CONSIDERED PROBABLE AND IS SUBSTANTIALLY CONTROLLED BY US. WE CONSIDER A DELIVERABLE TO HAVE STANDALONE VALUE IF THE PRODUCT OR SERVICE IS SOLD SEPARATELY BY US OR ANOTHER VENDOR OR COULD BE RESOLD BY THE CUSTOMER. FURTHER, OUR REVENUE\nARRANGEMENTS GENERALLY DO NOT INCLUDE A GENERAL RIGHT OF RETURN RELATIVE TO THE DELIVERED PRODUCTS. WHERE THE AFOREMENTIONED CRITERIA FOR A SEPARATE UNIT OF ACCOUNTING ARE NOT MET, THE DELIVERABLE IS COMBINED WITH THE UNDELIVERED ELEMENT(S) AND\nTREATED AS A SINGLE UNIT OF ACCOUNTING FOR THE PURPOSES OF ALLOCATION OF THE ARRANGEMENT CONSIDERATION AND REVENUE RECOGNITION. FOR THOSE UNITS OF ACCOUNTING THAT INCLUDE MORE THAN ONE DELIVERABLE BUT ARE TREATED AS A SINGLE UNIT OF ACCOUNTING, WE\nGENERALLY RECOGNIZE REVENUES OVER THE CONTRACTUAL PERIOD OF THE ARRANGEMENT OR IN THE CASE OF OUR CLOUD OFFERINGS, WE GENERALLY RECOGNIZE REVENUES OVER THE CONTRACTUAL TERM OF THE CLOUD SOFTWARE SUBSCRIPTION. FOR THE PURPOSES OF REVENUE\nCLASSIFICATION OF THE ELEMENTS THAT ARE ACCOUNTED FOR AS A SINGLE UNIT OF ACCOUNTING, WE ALLOCATE REVENUE TO THE RESPECTIVE REVENUE LINE ITEMS WITHIN OUR CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF OPERATIONS BASED ON A RATIONAL AND CONSISTENT METHODOLOGY UTILIZING\nOUR BEST ESTIMATE OF RELATIVE SELLING PRICES OF SUCH ELEMENTS.\nFOR OUR NONSOFTWARE MULTIPLE-ELEMENT ARRANGEMENTS, WE ALLOCATE REVENUE TO EACH\nELEMENT BASED ON A SELLING PRICE HIERARCHY AT THE ARRANGEMENT\u0092S INCEPTION. THE SELLING PRICE FOR EACH ELEMENT IS BASED UPON THE FOLLOWING SELLING PRICE HIERARCHY: VSOE IF AVAILABLE, THIRD PARTY EVIDENCE (TPE) IF VSOE IS NOT AVAILABLE, OR\nESTIMATED SELLING PRICE (ESP) IF NEITHER VSOE NOR TPE ARE AVAILABLE (A DESCRIPTION AS TO HOW WE DETERMINE VSOE, TPE AND ESP IS PROVIDED BELOW). IF A TANGIBLE HARDWARE SYSTEMS PRODUCT INCLUDES SOFTWARE, WE DETERMINE WHETHER THE TANGIBLE HARDWARE\nSYSTEMS PRODUCT AND THE SOFTWARE WORK TOGETHER TO DELIVER THE PRODUCT\u0092S ESSENTIAL FUNCTIONALITY AND, IF SO, THE ENTIRE PRODUCT IS TREATED AS A NONSOFTWARE DELIVERABLE. THE TOTAL ARRANGEMENT CONSIDERATION IS ALLOCATED TO EACH SEPARATE UNIT OF\nACCOUNTING FOR EACH OF THE NONSOFTWARE DELIVERABLES USING THE RELATIVE SELLING PRICES OF EACH UNIT BASED ON THE AFOREMENTIONED SELLING PRICE HIERARCHY. WE LIMIT THE AMOUNT OF REVENUE RECOGNIZED FOR DELIVERED ELEMENTS TO AN AMOUNT THAT IS NOT\nCONTINGENT UPON FUTURE DELIVERY OF ADDITIONAL PRODUCTS OR SERVICES OR MEETING OF ANY SPECIFIED PERFORMANCE CONDITIONS.\nWHEN POSSIBLE, WE\nESTABLISH VSOE OF SELLING PRICE FOR DELIVERABLES IN SOFTWARE AND NONSOFTWARE MULTIPLE-ELEMENT ARRANGEMENTS USING THE PRICE CHARGED FOR A DELIVERABLE WHEN SOLD SEPARATELY AND FOR SOFTWARE LICENSE UPDATES AND PRODUCT SUPPORT AND HARDWARE SYSTEMS\nSUPPORT, BASED ON THE RENEWAL RATES OFFERED TO CUSTOMERS. TPE\n45\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nIS ESTABLISHED BY EVALUATING SIMILAR AND INTERCHANGEABLE COMPETITOR PRODUCTS OR SERVICES IN STANDALONE ARRANGEMENTS WITH SIMILARLY SITUATED CUSTOMERS. IF WE ARE UNABLE TO DETERMINE THE SELLING\nPRICE BECAUSE VSOE OR TPE DOES NOT EXIST, WE DETERMINE ESP FOR THE PURPOSES OF ALLOCATING THE ARRANGEMENT BY REVIEWING HISTORICAL TRANSACTIONS, INCLUDING TRANSACTIONS WHEREBY THE DELIVERABLE WAS SOLD ON A STANDALONE BASIS AND CONSIDERING SEVERAL\nOTHER EXTERNAL AND INTERNAL FACTORS INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, PRICING PRACTICES INCLUDING DISCOUNTING, MARGIN OBJECTIVES, COMPETITION, CONTRACTUALLY STATED PRICES, THE GEOGRAPHIES IN WHICH WE OFFER OUR PRODUCTS AND SERVICES, THE TYPE OF\nCUSTOMER (I.E., DISTRIBUTOR, VALUE ADDED RESELLER, GOVERNMENT AGENCY AND DIRECT END USER, AMONG OTHERS) AND THE STAGE OF THE PRODUCT LIFECYCLE. THE DETERMINATION OF ESP IS MADE THROUGH CONSULTATION WITH AND APPROVAL BY OUR MANAGEMENT, TAKING INTO\nCONSIDERATION OUR PRICING MODEL AND GO-TO-MARKET STRATEGY. AS OUR, OR OUR COMPETITORS\u0092, PRICING AND GO-TO-MARKET STRATEGIES EVOLVE, WE MAY MODIFY OUR PRICING PRACTICES IN THE FUTURE, WHICH COULD RESULT IN CHANGES TO OUR DETERMINATION OF VSOE,\nTPE AND ESP. AS A RESULT, OUR FUTURE REVENUE RECOGNITION FOR MULTIPLE-ELEMENT ARRANGEMENTS COULD DIFFER MATERIALLY FROM OUR RESULTS IN THE CURRENT PERIOD. SELLING PRICES ARE ANALYZED ON AN ANNUAL BASIS OR MORE FREQUENTLY IF WE EXPERIENCE SIGNIFICANT\nCHANGES IN OUR SELLING PRICES.\nREVENUE RECOGNITION POLICIES APPLICABLE TO BOTH SOFTWARE AND NONSOFTWARE ELEMENTS\nREVENUE RECOGNITION FOR MULTIPLE-ELEMENT ARRANGEMENTS\n\u0097\nARRANGEMENTS WITH SOFTWARE AND NONSOFTWARE ELEMENTS\nWE ALSO ENTER INTO MULTIPLE-ELEMENT ARRANGEMENTS THAT MAY INCLUDE A COMBINATION OF OUR VARIOUS SOFTWARE RELATED AND NONSOFTWARE RELATED PRODUCTS AND\nSERVICES OFFERINGS INCLUDING NEW SOFTWARE LICENSES, SOFTWARE LICENSE UPDATES AND PRODUCT SUPPORT, CLOUD SAAS, PAAS AND IAAS OFFERINGS, HARDWARE SYSTEMS PRODUCTS, HARDWARE SYSTEMS SUPPORT, CONSULTING, ADVANCED CUSTOMER SUPPORT SERVICES AND EDUCATION.\nIN SUCH ARRANGEMENTS, WE FIRST ALLOCATE THE TOTAL ARRANGEMENT CONSIDERATION BASED ON THE RELATIVE SELLING PRICES OF THE SOFTWARE GROUP OF ELEMENTS AS A WHOLE AND TO THE NONSOFTWARE ELEMENTS. WE THEN FURTHER ALLOCATE CONSIDERATION WITHIN THE SOFTWARE\nGROUP TO THE RESPECTIVE ELEMENTS WITHIN THAT GROUP FOLLOWING THE GUIDANCE IN ASC 985-605 AND OUR POLICIES AS DESCRIBED ABOVE. AFTER THE ARRANGEMENT CONSIDERATION HAS BEEN ALLOCATED TO THE ELEMENTS, WE ACCOUNT FOR EACH RESPECTIVE ELEMENT IN THE\nARRANGEMENT AS DESCRIBED ABOVE.\nOTHER REVENUE RECOGNITION POLICIES APPLICABLE TO SOFTWARE AND NONSOFTWARE ELEMENTS\nMANY OF OUR SOFTWARE ARRANGEMENTS INCLUDE CONSULTING IMPLEMENTATION SERVICES SOLD SEPARATELY UNDER CONSULTING ENGAGEMENT CONTRACTS AND ARE INCLUDED AS A\nPART OF OUR SERVICES BUSINESS. CONSULTING REVENUES FROM THESE ARRANGEMENTS ARE GENERALLY ACCOUNTED FOR SEPARATELY FROM NEW SOFTWARE LICENSES REVENUES BECAUSE THE ARRANGEMENTS QUALIFY AS SERVICES TRANSACTIONS AS DEFINED IN ASC 985-605. THE MORE\nSIGNIFICANT FACTORS CONSIDERED IN DETERMINING WHETHER THE REVENUES SHOULD BE ACCOUNTED FOR SEPARATELY INCLUDE THE NATURE OF SERVICES (I.E., CONSIDERATION OF WHETHER THE SERVICES ARE ESSENTIAL TO THE FUNCTIONALITY OF THE LICENSED PRODUCT), DEGREE OF\nRISK, AVAILABILITY OF SERVICES FROM OTHER VENDORS, TIMING OF PAYMENTS AND IMPACT OF MILESTONES OR ACCEPTANCE CRITERIA ON THE REALIZABILITY OF THE SOFTWARE LICENSE FEE. REVENUES FOR CONSULTING SERVICES ARE GENERALLY RECOGNIZED AS THE SERVICES ARE\nPERFORMED. IF THERE IS A SIGNIFICANT UNCERTAINTY ABOUT THE PROJECT COMPLETION OR RECEIPT OF PAYMENT FOR THE CONSULTING SERVICES, REVENUES ARE DEFERRED UNTIL THE UNCERTAINTY IS SUFFICIENTLY RESOLVED. WE ESTIMATE THE PROPORTIONAL PERFORMANCE ON\nCONTRACTS WITH FIXED OR \u0093NOT TO EXCEED\u0094 FEES ON A MONTHLY BASIS UTILIZING HOURS INCURRED TO DATE AS A PERCENTAGE OF TOTAL ESTIMATED HOURS TO COMPLETE THE PROJECT. IF WE DO NOT HAVE A SUFFICIENT BASIS TO MEASURE PROGRESS TOWARDS COMPLETION,\nREVENUES ARE RECOGNIZED WHEN WE RECEIVE FINAL ACCEPTANCE FROM THE CUSTOMER THAT THE SERVICES HAVE BEEN COMPLETED. WHEN TOTAL COST ESTIMATES EXCEED REVENUES, WE ACCRUE FOR THE ESTIMATED LOSSES IMMEDIATELY USING COST ESTIMATES THAT ARE BASED UPON AN\nAVERAGE FULLY BURDENED DAILY RATE APPLICABLE TO THE CONSULTING ORGANIZATION DELIVERING THE SERVICES. THE COMPLEXITY OF THE ESTIMATION PROCESS AND FACTORS RELATING TO THE ASSUMPTIONS, RISKS AND UNCERTAINTIES INHERENT WITH THE APPLICATION OF THE\nPROPORTIONAL PERFORMANCE METHOD OF ACCOUNTING AFFECTS THE AMOUNTS OF REVENUES AND RELATED EXPENSES REPORTED IN OUR CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS. A NUMBER OF INTERNAL AND EXTERNAL FACTORS CAN AFFECT OUR ESTIMATES, INCLUDING LABOR RATES,\nUTILIZATION AND EFFICIENCY VARIANCES AND SPECIFICATION AND TESTING REQUIREMENT CHANGES.\nOUR ADVANCED CUSTOMER SUPPORT SERVICES ARE OFFERED AS\nSTANDALONE ARRANGEMENTS OR AS A PART OF ARRANGEMENTS TO CUSTOMERS BUYING OTHER SOFTWARE AND NON-SOFTWARE PRODUCTS AND SERVICES. WE OFFER THESE ADVANCED SUPPORT\n46\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nSERVICES, BOTH ON-PREMISES AND REMOTE, TO ORACLE CUSTOMERS TO ENABLE INCREASED PERFORMANCE AND HIGHER AVAILABILITY OF THEIR PRODUCTS AND SERVICES. DEPENDING UPON THE NATURE OF THE ARRANGEMENT,\nREVENUES FROM THESE SERVICES ARE RECOGNIZED AS THE SERVICES ARE PERFORMED OR RATABLY OVER THE TERM OF THE SERVICE PERIOD, WHICH IS GENERALLY ONE YEAR OR LESS.\nEDUCATION REVENUES ARE ALSO A PART OF OUR SERVICES BUSINESS AND INCLUDE INSTRUCTOR-LED, MEDIA-BASED AND INTERNET-BASED TRAINING IN THE USE OF OUR SOFTWARE AND HARDWARE PRODUCTS. EDUCATION REVENUES ARE\nRECOGNIZED AS THE CLASSES OR OTHER EDUCATION OFFERINGS ARE DELIVERED.\nIF AN ARRANGEMENT CONTAINS MULTIPLE ELEMENTS AND DOES NOT QUALIFY FOR\nSEPARATE ACCOUNTING FOR THE PRODUCT AND SERVICE TRANSACTIONS, THEN NEW SOFTWARE LICENSES REVENUES AND\/OR HARDWARE SYSTEMS PRODUCTS REVENUES, INCLUDING THE COSTS OF HARDWARE SYSTEMS PRODUCTS, ARE GENERALLY RECOGNIZED TOGETHER WITH THE SERVICES BASED\nON CONTRACT ACCOUNTING USING EITHER THE PERCENTAGE-OF-COMPLETION OR COMPLETED-CONTRACT METHOD. CONTRACT ACCOUNTING IS APPLIED TO ANY BUNDLED SOFTWARE AND CLOUD, HARDWARE SYSTEMS AND SERVICES ARRANGEMENTS: (1) THAT INCLUDE MILESTONES OR CUSTOMER\nSPECIFIC ACCEPTANCE CRITERIA THAT MAY AFFECT COLLECTION OF THE SOFTWARE LICENSE OR HARDWARE SYSTEMS PRODUCT FEES; (2) WHERE CONSULTING SERVICES INCLUDE SIGNIFICANT MODIFICATION OR CUSTOMIZATION OF THE SOFTWARE OR HARDWARE SYSTEMS PRODUCT OR ARE\nOF A SPECIALIZED NATURE AND GENERALLY PERFORMED ONLY BY ORACLE; (3) WHERE SIGNIFICANT CONSULTING SERVICES ARE PROVIDED FOR IN THE SOFTWARE LICENSE CONTRACT OR HARDWARE SYSTEMS PRODUCT CONTRACT WITHOUT ADDITIONAL CHARGE OR ARE SUBSTANTIALLY\nDISCOUNTED; OR (4) WHERE THE SOFTWARE LICENSE OR HARDWARE SYSTEMS PRODUCT PAYMENT IS TIED TO THE PERFORMANCE OF CONSULTING SERVICES. FOR THE PURPOSES OF REVENUE CLASSIFICATION OF THE ELEMENTS THAT ARE ACCOUNTED FOR AS A SINGLE UNIT OF\nACCOUNTING, WE ALLOCATE REVENUES TO SOFTWARE AND NONSOFTWARE ELEMENTS BASED ON A RATIONAL AND CONSISTENT METHODOLOGY UTILIZING OUR BEST ESTIMATE OF THE RELATIVE SELLING PRICE OF SUCH ELEMENTS.\nWE ALSO EVALUATE ARRANGEMENTS WITH GOVERNMENTAL ENTITIES CONTAINING \u0093FISCAL FUNDING\u0094 OR \u0093TERMINATION FOR CONVENIENCE\u0094 PROVISIONS, WHEN SUCH PROVISIONS ARE REQUIRED BY LAW, TO DETERMINE\nTHE PROBABILITY OF POSSIBLE CANCELLATION. WE CONSIDER MULTIPLE FACTORS, INCLUDING THE HISTORY WITH THE CUSTOMER IN SIMILAR TRANSACTIONS, THE \u0093ESSENTIAL USE\u0094 OF THE SOFTWARE OR HARDWARE SYSTEMS PRODUCTS AND THE PLANNING, BUDGETING AND\nAPPROVAL PROCESSES UNDERTAKEN BY THE GOVERNMENTAL ENTITY. IF WE DETERMINE UPON EXECUTION OF THESE ARRANGEMENTS THAT THE LIKELIHOOD OF CANCELLATION IS REMOTE, WE THEN RECOGNIZE REVENUES ONCE ALL OF THE CRITERIA DESCRIBED ABOVE HAVE BEEN MET. IF SUCH\nA DETERMINATION CANNOT BE MADE, REVENUES ARE RECOGNIZED UPON THE EARLIER OF CASH RECEIPT OR APPROVAL OF THE APPLICABLE FUNDING PROVISION BY THE GOVERNMENTAL ENTITY.\nWE ASSESS WHETHER FEES ARE FIXED OR DETERMINABLE AT THE TIME OF SALE AND RECOGNIZE REVENUES IF ALL OTHER REVENUE RECOGNITION REQUIREMENTS ARE MET. OUR STANDARD PAYMENT TERMS ARE NET 30 DAYS. HOWEVER,\nPAYMENT TERMS MAY VARY BASED ON THE COUNTRY IN WHICH THE AGREEMENT IS EXECUTED. PAYMENTS THAT ARE DUE WITHIN SIX MONTHS ARE GENERALLY DEEMED TO BE FIXED OR DETERMINABLE BASED ON OUR SUCCESSFUL COLLECTION HISTORY ON SUCH ARRANGEMENTS, AND THEREBY\nSATISFY THE REQUIRED CRITERIA FOR REVENUE RECOGNITION.\nWHILE MOST OF OUR ARRANGEMENTS FOR SALES WITHIN OUR BUSINESSES INCLUDE SHORT-TERM\nPAYMENT TERMS, WE HAVE A STANDARD PRACTICE OF PROVIDING LONG-TERM FINANCING TO CREDITWORTHY CUSTOMERS PRIMARILY THROUGH OUR FINANCING DIVISION. SINCE FISCAL 1989, WHEN OUR FINANCING DIVISION WAS FORMED, WE HAVE ESTABLISHED A HISTORY OF COLLECTION,\nWITHOUT CONCESSIONS, ON THESE RECEIVABLES WITH PAYMENT TERMS THAT GENERALLY EXTEND UP TO FIVE YEARS FROM THE CONTRACT DATE. PROVIDED ALL OTHER REVENUE RECOGNITION CRITERIA HAVE BEEN MET, WE RECOGNIZE NEW SOFTWARE LICENSES REVENUES AND HARDWARE\nSYSTEMS PRODUCTS REVENUES FOR THESE ARRANGEMENTS UPON DELIVERY, NET OF ANY PAYMENT DISCOUNTS FROM FINANCING TRANSACTIONS. WE HAVE GENERALLY SOLD RECEIVABLES FINANCED THROUGH OUR FINANCING DIVISION ON A NON-RECOURSE BASIS TO THIRD PARTY FINANCING\nINSTITUTIONS WITHIN 90 DAYS OF THE CONTRACTS\u0092 DATES OF EXECUTION AND WE CLASSIFY THE PROCEEDS FROM THESE SALES AS CASH FLOWS FROM OPERATING ACTIVITIES IN OUR CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF CASH FLOWS. WE ACCOUNT FOR THE SALES OF THESE RECEIVABLES\nAS \u0093TRUE SALES\u0094 AS DEFINED IN ASC 860,\nTRANSFERS AND SERVICING\n, AS WE ARE CONSIDERED TO HAVE SURRENDERED CONTROL OF THESE FINANCING RECEIVABLES.\nIN ADDITION, WE ENTER INTO ARRANGEMENTS WITH LEASING COMPANIES FOR THE SALE OF OUR HARDWARE SYSTEMS PRODUCTS. THESE LEASING COMPANIES, IN TURN, LEASE OUR PRODUCTS TO END-USERS. THE LEASING COMPANIES\nGENERALLY HAVE NO RECOURSE TO US IN THE EVENT OF DEFAULT BY THE END-USER AND WE RECOGNIZE REVENUE UPON DELIVERY, IF ALL OTHER REVENUE RECOGNITION CRITERIA HAVE BEEN MET.\n47\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nOUR CUSTOMERS INCLUDE SEVERAL OF OUR SUPPLIERS AND, OCCASIONALLY, WE HAVE PURCHASED GOODS OR SERVICES FOR\nOUR OPERATIONS FROM THESE VENDORS AT OR ABOUT THE SAME TIME THAT WE HAVE SOLD OUR PRODUCTS TO THESE SAME COMPANIES (CONCURRENT TRANSACTIONS). SOFTWARE LICENSE AGREEMENTS OR SALES OF HARDWARE SYSTEMS THAT OCCUR WITHIN A THREE-MONTH TIME PERIOD FROM\nTHE DATE WE HAVE PURCHASED GOODS OR SERVICES FROM THAT SAME CUSTOMER ARE REVIEWED FOR APPROPRIATE ACCOUNTING TREATMENT AND DISCLOSURE. WHEN WE ACQUIRE GOODS OR SERVICES FROM A CUSTOMER, WE NEGOTIATE THE PURCHASE SEPARATELY FROM ANY SALES\nTRANSACTION, AT TERMS WE CONSIDER TO BE AT ARM\u0092S LENGTH AND SETTLE THE PURCHASE IN CASH. WE RECOGNIZE REVENUES FROM CONCURRENT TRANSACTIONS IF ALL OF OUR REVENUE RECOGNITION CRITERIA ARE MET AND THE GOODS AND SERVICES ACQUIRED ARE NECESSARY FOR\nOUR CURRENT OPERATIONS.\nBUSINESS COMBINATIONS\nWE APPLY THE PROVISIONS OF ASC 805,\nBUSINESS COMBINATIONS\n, IN THE ACCOUNTING FOR OUR ACQUISITIONS. IT REQUIRES US TO RECOGNIZE SEPARATELY FROM GOODWILL THE ASSETS ACQUIRED AND THE LIABILITIES\nASSUMED AT THE ACQUISITION DATE FAIR VALUES. GOODWILL AS OF THE ACQUISITION DATE IS MEASURED AS THE EXCESS OF CONSIDERATION TRANSFERRED OVER THE NET OF THE ACQUISITION DATE FAIR VALUES OF THE ASSETS ACQUIRED AND THE LIABILITIES ASSUMED. WHILE WE USE\nOUR BEST ESTIMATES AND ASSUMPTIONS TO ACCURATELY VALUE ASSETS ACQUIRED AND LIABILITIES ASSUMED AT THE ACQUISITION DATE AS WELL AS CONTINGENT CONSIDERATION, WHERE APPLICABLE, OUR ESTIMATES ARE INHERENTLY UNCERTAIN AND SUBJECT TO REFINEMENT. AS A\nRESULT, DURING THE MEASUREMENT PERIOD, WHICH MAY BE UP TO ONE YEAR FROM THE ACQUISITION DATE, WE RECORD ADJUSTMENTS TO THE ASSETS ACQUIRED AND LIABILITIES ASSUMED WITH THE CORRESPONDING OFFSET TO GOODWILL. UPON THE CONCLUSION OF THE MEASUREMENT\nPERIOD OR FINAL DETERMINATION OF THE VALUES OF ASSETS ACQUIRED OR LIABILITIES ASSUMED, WHICHEVER COMES FIRST, ANY SUBSEQUENT ADJUSTMENTS ARE RECORDED TO OUR CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF OPERATIONS.\nACCOUNTING FOR BUSINESS COMBINATIONS REQUIRES OUR MANAGEMENT TO MAKE SIGNIFICANT ESTIMATES AND ASSUMPTIONS, ESPECIALLY AT THE ACQUISITION DATE, INCLUDING\nOUR ESTIMATES FOR INTANGIBLE ASSETS, CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS ASSUMED, RESTRUCTURING LIABILITIES, PRE-ACQUISITION CONTINGENCIES AND CONTINGENT CONSIDERATION, WHERE APPLICABLE. ALTHOUGH WE BELIEVE THE ASSUMPTIONS AND ESTIMATES WE HAVE MADE IN THE PAST\nHAVE BEEN REASONABLE AND APPROPRIATE, THEY ARE BASED IN PART ON HISTORICAL EXPERIENCE AND INFORMATION OBTAINED FROM THE MANAGEMENT OF THE ACQUIRED COMPANIES AND ARE INHERENTLY UNCERTAIN.\nEXAMPLES OF CRITICAL ESTIMATES IN VALUING CERTAIN OF THE INTANGIBLE ASSETS WE HAVE ACQUIRED INCLUDE BUT ARE NOT LIMITED TO.\n\u0095\nFUTURE EXPECTED CASH FLOWS FROM SOFTWARE LICENSE SALES, CLOUD SAAS, PAAS AND IAAS CONTRACTS, HARDWARE SYSTEMS PRODUCT SALES, SUPPORT AGREEMENTS,\nCONSULTING CONTRACTS, OTHER CUSTOMER CONTRACTS, ACQUIRED DEVELOPED TECHNOLOGIES AND PATENTS;\n\u0095\nEXPECTED COSTS TO DEVELOP THE IN-PROCESS RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT INTO COMMERCIALLY VIABLE PRODUCTS AND ESTIMATED CASH FLOWS FROM THE PROJECTS WHEN\nCOMPLETED;\n\u0095\nTHE ACQUIRED COMPANY\u0092S BRAND AND COMPETITIVE POSITION, AS WELL AS ASSUMPTIONS ABOUT THE PERIOD OF TIME THE ACQUIRED BRAND WILL CONTINUE TO BE USED\nIN THE COMBINED COMPANY\u0092S PRODUCT PORTFOLIO; AND\n\u0095\nDISCOUNT RATES.\nUNANTICIPATED EVENTS AND CIRCUMSTANCES MAY OCCUR THAT MAY AFFECT THE ACCURACY OR VALIDITY OF SUCH ASSUMPTIONS, ESTIMATES OR ACTUAL RESULTS.\nWE ESTIMATE THE FAIR VALUES OF OUR CLOUD SAAS AND PAAS (COLLECTIVELY, CLOUD SOFTWARE SUBSCRIPTIONS), SOFTWARE LICENSE UPDATES AND PRODUCT SUPPORT, AND\nHARDWARE SYSTEMS SUPPORT OBLIGATIONS ASSUMED. THE ESTIMATED FAIR VALUES OF THESE PERFORMANCE OBLIGATIONS ARE DETERMINED UTILIZING A COST BUILD-UP APPROACH. THE COST BUILD-UP APPROACH DETERMINES FAIR VALUE BY ESTIMATING THE COSTS RELATED TO\nFULFILLING THE OBLIGATIONS PLUS A NORMAL PROFIT MARGIN. THE ESTIMATED COSTS TO FULFILL THE OBLIGATIONS ARE BASED ON THE HISTORICAL DIRECT COSTS RELATED TO PROVIDING THE SERVICES INCLUDING THE CORRECTION OF ANY ERRORS IN THE PRODUCTS ACQUIRED. THE\nSUM OF THESE COSTS AND OPERATING PROFIT APPROXIMATES, IN THEORY, THE AMOUNT THAT WE WOULD BE REQUIRED TO PAY A THIRD PARTY TO ASSUME THE PERFORMANCE OBLIGATIONS. WE DO NOT INCLUDE ANY COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH SELLING EFFORTS OR RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT\nOR THE RELATED FULFILLMENT MARGINS ON THESE COSTS. PROFIT ASSOCIATED WITH ANY SELLING EFFORTS IS EXCLUDED BECAUSE THE\n48\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nACQUIRED ENTITIES WOULD HAVE CONCLUDED THOSE SELLING EFFORTS ON THE PERFORMANCE OBLIGATIONS PRIOR TO THE ACQUISITION DATE. WE ALSO DO NOT INCLUDE THE ESTIMATED RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT COSTS IN\nOUR FAIR VALUE DETERMINATIONS, AS THESE COSTS ARE NOT DEEMED TO REPRESENT A LEGAL OBLIGATION AT THE TIME OF ACQUISITION. AS A RESULT, WE DID NOT RECOGNIZE CLOUD SAAS AND PAAS REVENUES RELATED TO CLOUD SAAS AND PAAS CONTRACTS IN THE AMOUNTS OF $12\nMILLION, $17 MILLION AND $45 MILLION THAT WOULD HAVE BEEN OTHERWISE RECORDED BY THE ACQUIRED BUSINESSES AS INDEPENDENT ENTITIES IN FISCAL 2015, 2014 AND 2013, RESPECTIVELY. WE DID NOT RECOGNIZE SOFTWARE LICENSE UPDATES AND PRODUCT SUPPORT REVENUES\nRELATED TO SUPPORT CONTRACTS IN THE AMOUNTS OF $11 MILLION, $3 MILLION AND $14 MILLION THAT WOULD HAVE BEEN OTHERWISE RECORDED BY THE ACQUIRED BUSINESSES AS INDEPENDENT ENTITIES IN FISCAL 2015, 2014 AND 2013, RESPECTIVELY. IN ADDITION, WE DID NOT\nRECOGNIZE HARDWARE SYSTEMS SUPPORT REVENUES RELATED TO HARDWARE SYSTEMS SUPPORT CONTRACTS THAT WOULD HAVE OTHERWISE BEEN RECORDED BY THE ACQUIRED BUSINESSES AS INDEPENDENT ENTITIES IN THE AMOUNTS OF $4 MILLION, $11 MILLION AND $14 MILLION FOR FISCAL\n2015, 2014 AND 2013, RESPECTIVELY. HISTORICALLY, SUBSTANTIALLY ALL OF OUR CUSTOMERS, INCLUDING CUSTOMERS FROM ACQUIRED COMPANIES, RENEW THEIR SOFTWARE LICENSE UPDATES AND PRODUCT SUPPORT CONTRACTS WHEN THE CONTRACTS ARE ELIGIBLE FOR RENEWAL AND WE\nSTRIVE TO RENEW CLOUD SAAS AND PAAS, AND HARDWARE SYSTEMS SUPPORT CONTRACTS. TO THE EXTENT CLOUD SAAS AND PAAS, SOFTWARE SUPPORT OR HARDWARE SYSTEMS SUPPORT CONTRACTS ARE RENEWED, WE WILL RECOGNIZE THE REVENUES FOR THE FULL VALUES OF THE CONTRACTS\nOVER THEIR RESPECTIVE CONTRACTUAL PERIODS, WHICH ARE GENERALLY ONE YEAR IN DURATION.\nIN CONNECTION WITH A BUSINESS COMBINATION OR OTHER\nSTRATEGIC INITIATIVE, WE MAY ESTIMATE COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH RESTRUCTURING PLANS COMMITTED TO BY OUR MANAGEMENT. RESTRUCTURING COSTS ARE TYPICALLY COMPRISED OF EMPLOYEE SEVERANCE COSTS, COSTS OF CONSOLIDATING DUPLICATE FACILITIES AND CONTRACT\nTERMINATION COSTS. RESTRUCTURING EXPENSES ARE BASED UPON PLANS THAT HAVE BEEN COMMITTED TO BY OUR MANAGEMENT, BUT MAY BE REFINED IN SUBSEQUENT PERIODS. WE ACCOUNT FOR COSTS TO EXIT OR RESTRUCTURE CERTAIN ACTIVITIES OF AN ACQUIRED COMPANY SEPARATELY\nFROM THE BUSINESS COMBINATION PURSUANT TO ASC 420,\nEXIT OR DISPOSAL COST OBLIGATIONS.\nA LIABILITY FOR COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH AN EXIT OR DISPOSAL ACTIVITY IS RECOGNIZED AND MEASURED AT ITS FAIR VALUE IN OUR CONSOLIDATED STATEMENT OF OPERATIONS\nIN THE PERIOD IN WHICH THE LIABILITY IS INCURRED. WHEN ESTIMATING THE FAIR VALUE OF FACILITY RESTRUCTURING ACTIVITIES, ASSUMPTIONS ARE APPLIED REGARDING ESTIMATED SUB-LEASE PAYMENTS TO BE RECEIVED, WHICH CAN DIFFER MATERIALLY FROM ACTUAL RESULTS.\nTHIS MAY REQUIRE US TO REVISE OUR INITIAL ESTIMATES WHICH MAY MATERIALLY AFFECT OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL POSITION IN THE PERIOD THE REVISION IS MADE.\nFOR A GIVEN ACQUISITION, WE MAY IDENTIFY CERTAIN PRE-ACQUISITION CONTINGENCIES AS OF THE ACQUISITION DATE AND MAY EXTEND OUR REVIEW AND EVALUATION OF THESE PRE-ACQUISITION CONTINGENCIES THROUGHOUT THE\nMEASUREMENT PERIOD IN ORDER TO OBTAIN SUFFICIENT INFORMATION TO ASSESS WHETHER WE INCLUDE THESE CONTINGENCIES AS A PART OF THE FAIR VALUE ESTIMATES OF ASSETS ACQUIRED AND LIABILITIES ASSUMED AND, IF SO, TO DETERMINE THEIR ESTIMATED AMOUNTS.\nIF WE CANNOT REASONABLY DETERMINE THE FAIR VALUE OF A PRE-ACQUISITION CONTINGENCY (NON-INCOME TAX RELATED) BY THE END OF THE MEASUREMENT\nPERIOD, WHICH IS GENERALLY THE CASE GIVEN THE NATURE OF SUCH MATTERS, WE WILL RECOGNIZE AN ASSET OR A LIABILITY FOR SUCH PRE-ACQUISITION CONTINGENCY IF: (I) IT IS PROBABLE THAT AN ASSET EXISTED OR A LIABILITY HAD BEEN INCURRED AT THE\nACQUISITION DATE AND (II) THE AMOUNT OF THE ASSET OR LIABILITY CAN BE REASONABLY ESTIMATED. SUBSEQUENT TO THE MEASUREMENT PERIOD, CHANGES IN OUR ESTIMATES OF SUCH CONTINGENCIES WILL AFFECT EARNINGS AND COULD HAVE A MATERIAL EFFECT ON OUR\nRESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL POSITION.\nIN ADDITION, UNCERTAIN TAX POSITIONS AND TAX RELATED VALUATION ALLOWANCES ASSUMED IN CONNECTION\nWITH A BUSINESS COMBINATION ARE INITIALLY ESTIMATED AS OF THE ACQUISITION DATE. WE REEVALUATE THESE ITEMS QUARTERLY BASED UPON FACTS AND CIRCUMSTANCES THAT EXISTED AS OF THE ACQUISITION DATE WITH ANY ADJUSTMENTS TO OUR PRELIMINARY ESTIMATES BEING\nRECORDED TO GOODWILL IF IDENTIFIED WITHIN THE MEASUREMENT PERIOD. SUBSEQUENT TO THE MEASUREMENT PERIOD OR OUR FINAL DETERMINATION OF THE TAX ALLOWANCE\u0092S OR CONTINGENCY\u0092S ESTIMATED VALUE, WHICHEVER COMES FIRST, CHANGES TO THESE UNCERTAIN\nTAX POSITIONS AND TAX RELATED VALUATION ALLOWANCES WILL AFFECT OUR PROVISION FOR INCOME TAXES IN OUR CONSOLIDATED STATEMENT OF OPERATIONS AND COULD HAVE A MATERIAL IMPACT ON OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL POSITION.\nGOODWILL AND INTANGIBLE ASSETS\n\u0097\nIMPAIRMENT ASSESSMENTS\nWE REVIEW GOODWILL FOR IMPAIRMENT ANNUALLY AND WHENEVER EVENTS OR CHANGES IN CIRCUMSTANCES INDICATE ITS CARRYING VALUE MAY NOT BE RECOVERABLE IN ACCORDANCE WITH ASC 350,\nINTANGIBLES\u0097GOODWILL AND\nOTHER\n. ACCORDING TO ASC 350, WE CAN OPT TO PERFORM A QUALITATIVE ASSESSMENT TO TEST A REPORTING UNIT\u0092S GOODWILL FOR\n49\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nIMPAIRMENT OR WE CAN DIRECTLY PERFORM THE TWO STEP IMPAIRMENT TEST. BASED ON OUR QUALITATIVE ASSESSMENT, IF WE DETERMINE THAT THE FAIR VALUE OF A REPORTING UNIT IS MORE LIKELY THAN NOT (I.E., A\nLIKELIHOOD OF MORE THAN 50 PERCENT) TO BE LESS THAN ITS CARRYING AMOUNT, THE TWO STEP IMPAIRMENT TEST PRESCRIBED BY ASC 350 WILL BE PERFORMED. IN THE FIRST STEP, WE COMPARE THE FAIR VALUE OF EACH REPORTING UNIT TO ITS CARRYING VALUE. IF THE FAIR\nVALUE OF THE REPORTING UNIT EXCEEDS THE CARRYING VALUE OF THE NET ASSETS ASSIGNED TO THAT UNIT, GOODWILL IS NOT CONSIDERED IMPAIRED AND WE ARE NOT REQUIRED TO PERFORM FURTHER TESTING. IF THE CARRYING VALUE OF THE NET ASSETS ASSIGNED TO THE REPORTING\nUNIT EXCEEDS THE FAIR VALUE OF THE REPORTING UNIT, THEN WE MUST PERFORM THE SECOND STEP OF THE IMPAIRMENT TEST IN ORDER TO DETERMINE THE IMPLIED FAIR VALUE OF THE REPORTING UNIT\u0092S GOODWILL. IF THE CARRYING VALUE OF A REPORTING UNIT\u0092S\nGOODWILL EXCEEDS ITS IMPLIED FAIR VALUE, THEN WE WOULD RECORD AN IMPAIRMENT LOSS EQUAL TO THE DIFFERENCE.\nDETERMINING THE FAIR VALUE OF A\nREPORTING UNIT INVOLVES THE USE OF SIGNIFICANT ESTIMATES AND ASSUMPTIONS. THESE ESTIMATES AND ASSUMPTIONS INCLUDE REVENUE GROWTH RATES AND OPERATING MARGINS USED TO CALCULATE PROJECTED FUTURE CASH FLOWS, RISK-ADJUSTED DISCOUNT RATES, FUTURE ECONOMIC\nAND MARKET CONDITIONS AND DETERMINATION OF APPROPRIATE MARKET COMPARABLES. WE BASE OUR FAIR VALUE ESTIMATES ON ASSUMPTIONS WE BELIEVE TO BE REASONABLE BUT THAT ARE INHERENTLY UNCERTAIN. ACTUAL FUTURE RESULTS MAY DIFFER FROM THOSE ESTIMATES. IN\nADDITION, WE MAKE CERTAIN JUDGMENTS AND ASSUMPTIONS IN ALLOCATING SHARED ASSETS AND LIABILITIES TO DETERMINE THE CARRYING VALUES FOR EACH OF OUR REPORTING UNITS.\nBASED UPON OUR MOST RECENT ANNUAL GOODWILL IMPAIRMENT REVIEW WHICH TOOK PLACE AS OF MARCH 1, 2015, WE RECORDED A GOODWILL IMPAIRMENT LOSS RELATED TO OUR HARDWARE SYSTEMS PRODUCTS REPORTING UNIT. WE\nCONSIDERED SEVERAL APPROACHES TO DETERMINE THE FAIR VALUE OF OUR HARDWARE SYSTEMS REPORTING UNIT AND CONCLUDED THE MOST APPROPRIATE TO BE THE INCOME APPROACH. BASED UPON THE COMPLETION OF OUR ANNUAL FORECASTING PROCESS, THE FAIR VALUE OF OUR\nHARDWARE SYSTEMS PRODUCTS REPORTING UNIT UNDER THE INCOME APPROACH WAS IMPACTED BY LOWER FORECASTED OPERATING RESULTS, PRIMARILY CAUSED BY LOWER FORECASTED REVENUES AND OUR CONTINUED INVESTMENT IN RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT ACTIVITIES. WE COMPARED THE\nIMPLIED FAIR VALUE OF GOODWILL IN OUR HARDWARE SYSTEMS PRODUCTS REPORTING UNIT TO ITS CARRYING VALUE, WHICH RESULTED IN A $186 MILLION GOODWILL IMPAIRMENT LOSS, REPRESENTING THE AGGREGATE AMOUNT OF GOODWILL IN OUR HARDWARE SYSTEMS PRODUCTS REPORTING\nUNIT. THE AGGREGATE HARDWARE SYSTEMS REPORTING UNIT GOODWILL THAT WAS IMPAIRED IN FISCAL 2015 RESULTED FROM OUR ACQUISITIONS OF PILLAR DATA SYSTEMS, INC., XSIGO SYSTEMS, INC., GREENBYTES, INC. AND MICROS SYSTEMS, INC. SUCH IMPAIRMENT LOSS WAS\nRECORDED TO ACQUISITION RELATED AND OTHER EXPENSES IN OUR FISCAL 2015 CONSOLIDATED STATEMENT OF OPERATIONS. WE DID NOT RECOGNIZE ANY GOODWILL IMPAIRMENT LOSSES IN FISCAL 2014 OR 2013.\nOUR MOST RECENT ANNUAL GOODWILL IMPAIRMENT REVIEW FOR OUR OTHER REPORTING UNITS, WHICH ALSO TOOK PLACE ON MARCH 1, 2015, DID NOT RESULT IN A GOODWILL IMPAIRMENT LOSS. OTHER THAN OUR CONSULTING\nREPORTING UNIT, ALL OF OUR OTHER REPORTING UNITS HAD FAIR VALUES THAT SUBSTANTIALLY EXCEEDED THEIR CARRYING VALUES. OUR CONSULTING REPORTING UNIT HAD $1.8 BILLION OF GOODWILL ON MARCH 1, 2015, AND EXPERIENCED REVENUE AND OPERATING MARGIN\nDECLINES IN FISCAL 2015. AS OF OUR MOST RECENT ANNUAL GOODWILL IMPAIRMENT REVIEW, OUR CONSULTING REPORTING UNIT\u0092S FAIR VALUE WAS 16% IN EXCESS OF ITS CARRYING VALUE. WE ESTIMATE THAT SHOULD OUR CONSULTING REPORTING UNIT\u0092S PROJECTED MARGINS\nAND RELATED CASH FLOWS UNFAVORABLY DEVIATE FROM OUR PROJECTIONS BY 20% OR MORE, OUR CONSULTING REPORTING UNIT LIKELY WOULD INCUR A GOODWILL IMPAIRMENT LOSS.\nWE MAKE JUDGMENTS ABOUT THE RECOVERABILITY OF PURCHASED FINITE LIVED INTANGIBLE ASSETS WHENEVER EVENTS OR CHANGES IN CIRCUMSTANCES INDICATE THAT AN IMPAIRMENT MAY EXIST. EACH PERIOD WE EVALUATE THE\nESTIMATED REMAINING USEFUL LIVES OF PURCHASED INTANGIBLE ASSETS AND WHETHER EVENTS OR CHANGES IN CIRCUMSTANCES WARRANT A REVISION TO THE REMAINING PERIODS OF AMORTIZATION. RECOVERABILITY OF FINITE LIVED INTANGIBLE ASSETS IS MEASURED BY COMPARISON OF\nTHE CARRYING AMOUNT OF THE ASSET TO THE FUTURE UNDISCOUNTED CASH FLOWS THE ASSET IS EXPECTED TO GENERATE. WE REVIEW INDEFINITE LIVED INTANGIBLE ASSETS FOR IMPAIRMENT ANNUALLY AND WHENEVER EVENTS OR CHANGES IN CIRCUMSTANCES INDICATE THE CARRYING\nVALUE MAY NOT BE RECOVERABLE. RECOVERABILITY OF INDEFINITE LIVED INTANGIBLE ASSETS IS MEASURED BY COMPARISON OF THE CARRYING AMOUNT OF THE ASSET TO ITS FAIR VALUE. IF THE ASSET IS CONSIDERED TO BE IMPAIRED, THE AMOUNT OF ANY IMPAIRMENT IS MEASURED\nAS THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE CARRYING VALUE AND THE FAIR VALUE OF THE IMPAIRED ASSET.\nASSUMPTIONS AND ESTIMATES ABOUT FUTURE VALUES AND\nREMAINING USEFUL LIVES OF OUR INTANGIBLE AND OTHER LONG-LIVED ASSETS ARE COMPLEX AND SUBJECTIVE. THEY CAN BE AFFECTED BY A VARIETY OF FACTORS, INCLUDING EXTERNAL FACTORS SUCH AS INDUSTRY AND ECONOMIC TRENDS AND INTERNAL FACTORS SUCH AS CHANGES IN\nOUR BUSINESS STRATEGY AND OUR INTERNAL\n50\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nFORECASTS. ALTHOUGH WE BELIEVE THE HISTORICAL ASSUMPTIONS AND ESTIMATES WE HAVE MADE ARE REASONABLE AND APPROPRIATE, DIFFERENT ASSUMPTIONS AND ESTIMATES COULD MATERIALLY IMPACT OUR REPORTED\nFINANCIAL RESULTS. WE DID NOT RECOGNIZE ANY INTANGIBLE ASSET IMPAIRMENT CHARGES IN FISCAL 2015, 2014 OR 2013.\nACCOUNTING FOR INCOME\nTAXES\nSIGNIFICANT JUDGMENT IS REQUIRED IN DETERMINING OUR WORLDWIDE INCOME TAX PROVISION. IN THE ORDINARY COURSE OF A GLOBAL BUSINESS,\nTHERE ARE MANY TRANSACTIONS AND CALCULATIONS WHERE THE ULTIMATE TAX OUTCOME IS UNCERTAIN. SOME OF THESE UNCERTAINTIES ARISE AS A CONSEQUENCE OF REVENUE SHARING AND COST REIMBURSEMENT ARRANGEMENTS AMONG RELATED ENTITIES, THE PROCESS OF IDENTIFYING\nITEMS OF REVENUES AND EXPENSES THAT QUALIFY FOR PREFERENTIAL TAX TREATMENT AND SEGREGATION OF FOREIGN AND DOMESTIC EARNINGS AND EXPENSES TO AVOID DOUBLE TAXATION. ALTHOUGH WE BELIEVE THAT OUR ESTIMATES ARE REASONABLE, THE FINAL TAX OUTCOME OF THESE\nMATTERS COULD BE DIFFERENT FROM THAT WHICH IS REFLECTED IN OUR HISTORICAL INCOME TAX PROVISIONS AND ACCRUALS. SUCH DIFFERENCES COULD HAVE A MATERIAL EFFECT ON OUR INCOME TAX PROVISION AND NET INCOME IN THE PERIOD IN WHICH SUCH DETERMINATION IS MADE.\nOUR EFFECTIVE TAX RATE INCLUDES THE IMPACT OF CERTAIN UNDISTRIBUTED FOREIGN EARNINGS FOR WHICH NO U.S. TAXES HAVE BEEN PROVIDED BECAUSE SUCH\nEARNINGS ARE PLANNED TO BE INDEFINITELY REINVESTED OUTSIDE THE UNITED STATES. REMITTANCES OF FOREIGN EARNINGS TO THE UNITED STATES ARE PLANNED BASED ON PROJECTED CASH FLOW, WORKING CAPITAL AND INVESTMENT NEEDS OF OUR FOREIGN AND DOMESTIC OPERATIONS.\nBASED ON THESE ASSUMPTIONS, WE ESTIMATE THE AMOUNT THAT WILL BE DISTRIBUTED TO THE UNITED STATES AND PROVIDE U.S. FEDERAL TAXES ON THESE AMOUNTS. MATERIAL CHANGES IN OUR ESTIMATES AS TO HOW MUCH OF OUR FOREIGN EARNINGS WILL BE DISTRIBUTED TO THE\nUNITED STATES OR TAX LEGISLATION THAT LIMITS OR RESTRICTS THE AMOUNT OF UNDISTRIBUTED FOREIGN EARNINGS THAT WE CONSIDER INDEFINITELY REINVESTED OUTSIDE THE UNITED STATES COULD MATERIALLY IMPACT OUR INCOME TAX PROVISION AND EFFECTIVE TAX RATE.\nWE RECORD A VALUATION ALLOWANCE TO REDUCE OUR DEFERRED TAX ASSETS TO THE AMOUNT THAT IS MORE LIKELY THAN NOT TO BE REALIZED. IN ORDER FOR US\nTO REALIZE OUR DEFERRED TAX ASSETS, WE MUST BE ABLE TO GENERATE SUFFICIENT TAXABLE INCOME IN THOSE JURISDICTIONS WHERE THE DEFERRED TAX ASSETS ARE LOCATED. WE CONSIDER FUTURE GROWTH, FORECASTED EARNINGS, FUTURE TAXABLE INCOME, THE MIX OF EARNINGS IN\nTHE JURISDICTIONS IN WHICH WE OPERATE, HISTORICAL EARNINGS, TAXABLE INCOME IN PRIOR YEARS, IF CARRYBACK IS PERMITTED UNDER THE LAW AND PRUDENT AND FEASIBLE TAX PLANNING STRATEGIES IN DETERMINING THE NEED FOR A VALUATION ALLOWANCE. IN THE EVENT WE\nWERE TO DETERMINE THAT WE WOULD NOT BE ABLE TO REALIZE ALL OR PART OF OUR NET DEFERRED TAX ASSETS IN THE FUTURE, AN ADJUSTMENT TO THE DEFERRED TAX ASSETS VALUATION ALLOWANCE WOULD BE CHARGED TO EARNINGS IN THE PERIOD IN WHICH WE MAKE SUCH A\nDETERMINATION, OR GOODWILL WOULD BE ADJUSTED AT OUR FINAL DETERMINATION OF THE VALUATION ALLOWANCE RELATED TO AN ACQUISITION WITHIN THE MEASUREMENT PERIOD. IF WE LATER DETERMINE THAT IT IS MORE LIKELY THAN NOT THAT THE NET DEFERRED TAX ASSETS WOULD\nBE REALIZED, WE WOULD REVERSE THE APPLICABLE PORTION OF THE PREVIOUSLY PROVIDED VALUATION ALLOWANCE AS AN ADJUSTMENT TO EARNINGS AT SUCH TIME.\nWE CALCULATE OUR CURRENT AND DEFERRED TAX PROVISION BASED ON ESTIMATES AND ASSUMPTIONS THAT COULD DIFFER FROM THE ACTUAL RESULTS REFLECTED IN INCOME TAX\nRETURNS FILED DURING THE SUBSEQUENT YEAR. ADJUSTMENTS BASED ON FILED RETURNS ARE GENERALLY RECORDED IN THE PERIOD WHEN THE TAX RETURNS ARE FILED AND THE GLOBAL TAX IMPLICATIONS ARE KNOWN, WHICH CAN MATERIALLY IMPACT OUR EFFECTIVE TAX RATE.\nTHE AMOUNT OF INCOME TAX WE PAY IS SUBJECT TO ONGOING AUDITS BY FEDERAL, STATE AND FOREIGN TAX AUTHORITIES, WHICH OFTEN RESULT IN PROPOSED\nASSESSMENTS. OUR ESTIMATE OF THE POTENTIAL OUTCOME FOR ANY UNCERTAIN TAX ISSUE IS HIGHLY JUDGMENTAL. A DESCRIPTION OF OUR ACCOUNTING POLICIES ASSOCIATED WITH TAX RELATED CONTINGENCIES ASSUMED AS A PART OF A BUSINESS COMBINATION IS PROVIDED UNDER\n\u0093BUSINESS COMBINATIONS\u0094 ABOVE. FOR THOSE TAX RELATED CONTINGENCIES THAT ARE NOT A PART OF A BUSINESS COMBINATION, WE ACCOUNT FOR THESE UNCERTAIN TAX ISSUES PURSUANT TO ASC 740,\nINCOME TAXES\n, WHICH CONTAINS A TWO-STEP APPROACH TO\nRECOGNIZING AND MEASURING UNCERTAIN TAX POSITIONS TAKEN OR EXPECTED TO BE TAKEN IN A TAX RETURN. THE FIRST STEP IS TO DETERMINE IF THE WEIGHT OF AVAILABLE EVIDENCE INDICATES THAT IT IS MORE LIKELY THAN NOT THAT THE TAX POSITION WILL BE SUSTAINED IN\nAN AUDIT, INCLUDING RESOLUTION OF ANY RELATED APPEALS OR LITIGATION PROCESSES. THE SECOND STEP IS TO MEASURE THE TAX BENEFIT AS THE LARGEST AMOUNT THAT IS MORE THAN 50% LIKELY TO BE REALIZED UPON ULTIMATE SETTLEMENT. ALTHOUGH WE BELIEVE WE HAVE\nADEQUATELY RESERVED FOR OUR UNCERTAIN TAX POSITIONS, NO ASSURANCE CAN BE GIVEN WITH RESPECT TO THE FINAL OUTCOME OF THESE MATTERS. WE ADJUST RESERVES FOR OUR UNCERTAIN TAX POSITIONS DUE TO CHANGING FACTS AND CIRCUMSTANCES, SUCH AS THE CLOSING OF A\nTAX AUDIT, JUDICIAL RULINGS, AND REFINEMENT OF ESTIMATES OR REALIZATION OF EARNINGS OR DEDUCTIONS THAT DIFFER FROM\n51\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nOUR ESTIMATES. TO THE EXTENT THAT THE FINAL OUTCOME OF THESE MATTERS IS DIFFERENT THAN THE AMOUNTS RECORDED, SUCH DIFFERENCES GENERALLY WILL IMPACT OUR PROVISION FOR INCOME TAXES IN THE PERIOD IN\nWHICH SUCH A DETERMINATION IS MADE. OUR PROVISIONS FOR INCOME TAXES INCLUDE THE IMPACT OF RESERVE PROVISIONS AND CHANGES TO RESERVES THAT ARE CONSIDERED APPROPRIATE AND ALSO INCLUDE THE RELATED INTEREST AND PENALTIES.\nIN ADDITION, AS A PART OF OUR ACCOUNTING FOR BUSINESS COMBINATIONS, INTANGIBLE ASSETS ARE RECOGNIZED AT FAIR VALUES AND GOODWILL IS MEASURED AS THE EXCESS\nOF CONSIDERATION TRANSFERRED OVER THE NET ESTIMATED FAIR VALUES OF ASSETS ACQUIRED. IMPAIRMENT CHARGES ASSOCIATED WITH GOODWILL ARE GENERALLY NOT TAX DEDUCTIBLE AND WILL RESULT IN AN INCREASED EFFECTIVE INCOME TAX RATE IN THE PERIOD THAT ANY\nIMPAIRMENT IS RECORDED. AMORTIZATION EXPENSES ASSOCIATED WITH ACQUIRED INTANGIBLE ASSETS ARE GENERALLY NOT TAX DEDUCTIBLE PURSUANT TO OUR EXISTING TAX STRUCTURE; HOWEVER, DEFERRED TAXES HAVE BEEN RECORDED FOR NON-DEDUCTIBLE AMORTIZATION EXPENSES AS\nA PART OF THE ACCOUNTING FOR BUSINESS COMBINATIONS. WE HAVE TAKEN INTO ACCOUNT THE ALLOCATION OF THESE IDENTIFIED INTANGIBLES AMONG DIFFERENT TAXING JURISDICTIONS, INCLUDING THOSE WITH NOMINAL OR ZERO PERCENT TAX RATES, IN ESTABLISHING THE RELATED\nDEFERRED TAX LIABILITIES.\nLEGAL AND OTHER CONTINGENCIES\nWE ARE CURRENTLY INVOLVED IN VARIOUS CLAIMS AND LEGAL PROCEEDINGS. QUARTERLY, WE REVIEW THE STATUS OF EACH SIGNIFICANT MATTER AND ASSESS OUR POTENTIAL FINANCIAL EXPOSURE. A DESCRIPTION OF OUR ACCOUNTING\nPOLICIES ASSOCIATED WITH CONTINGENCIES ASSUMED AS A PART OF A BUSINESS COMBINATION IS PROVIDED UNDER \u0093BUSINESS COMBINATIONS\u0094 ABOVE. FOR LEGAL AND OTHER CONTINGENCIES THAT ARE NOT A PART OF A BUSINESS COMBINATION, WE ACCRUE A LIABILITY FOR\nAN ESTIMATED LOSS IF THE POTENTIAL LOSS FROM ANY CLAIM OR LEGAL PROCEEDING IS CONSIDERED PROBABLE AND THE AMOUNT CAN BE REASONABLY ESTIMATED. SIGNIFICANT JUDGMENT IS REQUIRED IN BOTH THE DETERMINATION OF PROBABILITY AND THE DETERMINATION AS TO\nWHETHER THE AMOUNT OF AN EXPOSURE IS REASONABLY ESTIMABLE. BECAUSE OF UNCERTAINTIES RELATED TO THESE MATTERS, ACCRUALS ARE BASED ONLY ON THE BEST INFORMATION AVAILABLE AT THE TIME THE ACCRUALS ARE MADE. AS ADDITIONAL INFORMATION BECOMES AVAILABLE,\nWE REASSESS THE POTENTIAL LIABILITY RELATED TO OUR PENDING CLAIMS AND LITIGATION AND MAY REVISE OUR ESTIMATES. SUCH REVISIONS IN THE ESTIMATES OF THE POTENTIAL LIABILITIES COULD HAVE A MATERIAL IMPACT ON OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL\nPOSITION.\nSTOCK-BASED COMPENSATION\nWE ACCOUNT FOR SHARE-BASED PAYMENTS TO EMPLOYEES, INCLUDING GRANTS OF SERVICE-BASED EMPLOYEE STOCK OPTIONS, SERVICE-BASED RESTRICTED STOCK AWARDS, PERFORMANCE-BASED RESTRICTED STOCK AWARDS (PSUS) AND\nPURCHASES UNDER EMPLOYEE STOCK PURCHASE PLANS, IN ACCORDANCE WITH ASC 718,\nCOMPENSATION\u0097STOCK COMPENSATION,\nWHICH REQUIRES THAT SHARE-BASED PAYMENTS (TO THE EXTENT THEY ARE COMPENSATORY) BE RECOGNIZED IN OUR CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF\nOPERATIONS BASED ON THEIR FAIR VALUES AND THE ESTIMATED NUMBER OF SHARES WE ULTIMATELY EXPECT WILL VEST. FOR OUR SERVICE-BASED AWARDS, WE RECOGNIZE STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION EXPENSE ON A STRAIGHT-LINE BASIS OVER THE SERVICE PERIOD OF THE AWARD, WHICH\nIS GENERALLY FOUR YEARS. FOR OUR PSUS, WE RECOGNIZE STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION EXPENSE ON A STRAIGHT-LINE BASIS OVER THE SERVICE PERIOD FOR EACH SEPARATELY VESTING TRANCHE, AS THE PERFORMANCE CONDITIONS TO EVALUATE ATTAINMENT OF EACH TRANCHE FOR EACH\nPARTICIPANT ARE INDEPENDENT OF THE PERFORMANCE CONDITIONS FOR THE OTHER TRANCHES.\nWE ARE REQUIRED TO ESTIMATE THE STOCK AWARDS THAT WE\nULTIMATELY EXPECT TO VEST AND TO REDUCE STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION EXPENSE FOR THE EFFECTS OF ESTIMATED FORFEITURES OF AWARDS OVER THE EXPENSE RECOGNITION PERIOD. ALTHOUGH WE ESTIMATE THE RATE OF FUTURE FORFEITURES BASED UPON HISTORICAL EXPERIENCE,\nACTUAL FORFEITURES IN THE FUTURE MAY DIFFER. TO THE EXTENT OUR ACTUAL FORFEITURES ARE DIFFERENT THAN OUR ESTIMATES, WE RECORD A TRUE-UP FOR THE DIFFERENCE IN THE PERIOD THAT A GRANTEE TERMINATES OR THE AWARDS VEST AND SUCH TRUE-UPS COULD MATERIALLY\nAFFECT OUR OPERATING RESULTS. ADDITIONALLY, WE ALSO CONSIDER ON A QUARTERLY BASIS WHETHER THERE HAVE BEEN ANY SIGNIFICANT CHANGES IN FACTS AND CIRCUMSTANCES THAT WOULD AFFECT OUR EXPECTED FORFEITURE RATE.\nWE ESTIMATE THE FAIR VALUES OF EMPLOYEE STOCK OPTIONS USING A BLACK-SCHOLES-MERTON VALUATION MODEL. THE FAIR VALUE OF AN AWARD IS AFFECTED BY OUR STOCK\nPRICE ON THE DATE OF GRANT AS WELL AS OTHER ASSUMPTIONS INCLUDING THE ESTIMATED VOLATILITY OF OUR STOCK PRICE OVER THE TERM OF THE AWARDS AND THE ESTIMATED PERIOD OF TIME THAT WE EXPECT EMPLOYEES TO HOLD THEIR STOCK OPTIONS. THE RISK-FREE INTEREST\nRATE ASSUMPTION WE USE IS BASED UPON U.S. TREASURY INTEREST RATES APPROPRIATE FOR THE EXPECTED LIFE OF THE AWARDS. WE USE THE IMPLIED VOLATILITY OF PUBLICLY TRADED\n52\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nOPTIONS IN OUR STOCK IN ORDER TO ESTIMATE FUTURE STOCK PRICE TRENDS AS WE BELIEVE THAT IMPLIED VOLATILITY IS MORE REPRESENTATIVE OF FUTURE STOCK PRICE TRENDS THAN HISTORICAL VOLATILITY. IN ORDER\nTO DETERMINE THE ESTIMATED PERIOD OF TIME THAT WE EXPECT EMPLOYEES TO HOLD THEIR STOCK OPTIONS, WE HAVE USED HISTORICAL RATES OF EMPLOYEE GROUPS BY SENIORITY OF JOB CLASSIFICATION. OUR EXPECTED DIVIDEND RATE IS BASED UPON AN ANNUALIZED DIVIDEND\nYIELD BASED ON THE PER SHARE DIVIDEND DECLARED BY OUR BOARD OF DIRECTORS. THE AFOREMENTIONED INPUTS ENTERED INTO THE OPTION VALUATION MODEL WE USE TO FAIR VALUE OUR STOCK AWARDS ARE SUBJECTIVE ESTIMATES AND CHANGES TO THESE ESTIMATES WILL CAUSE THE\nFAIR VALUES OF OUR STOCK AWARDS AND RELATED STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION EXPENSE THAT WE RECORD TO VARY.\nWE ISSUE PSUS TO CERTAIN KEY EXECUTIVES.\nWE ESTIMATE THE FAIR VALUES OF THE PSUS BASED UPON THEIR INTRINSIC VALUES AS OF THE GRANT DATES AS THE VESTING CONDITIONS AND RELATED TERMS OF THE PSUS WERE COMMUNICATED TO EACH PARTICIPATING EMPLOYEE AS OF THEIR RESPECTIVE GRANT DATES AND INCLUDE\nATTAINMENT METRICS THAT ARE DEFINED, FIXED AND CONSISTENTLY DETERMINED BASED UPON CONSISTENT U.S. GAAP METRICS OR INTERNAL METRICS AND THAT REQUIRE THE EMPLOYEE TO RENDER SERVICE. THE PERFORMANCE CONDITIONS OF THE PSUS AFFECT THE NUMBER OF PSUS THAT\nWILL ULTIMATELY VEST AND BE ISSUED TO THE GRANTEE BASED UPON A \u0093TARGET\u0094 THAT IS SUBJECT TO CERTAIN ATTAINMENT MAXIMUMS, WITH THE POSSIBILITY THAT NONE WILL VEST IF APPLICABLE PERFORMANCE CONDITIONS ARE NOT MET. WE UPDATE THE AMOUNT OF\nSTOCK-BASED COMPENSATION EXPENSE, NET OF FORFEITURES, TO RECORD AS OF THE END OF EACH REPORTING PERIOD BASED ON THE EXPECTED ATTAINMENT OF PERFORMANCE TARGETS, WHICH IS SUBJECT TO CHANGE UNTIL A FINAL DETERMINATION IS KNOWN. CHANGES TO THE TARGET\nESTIMATES ARE REFLECTED IN THE AMOUNT OF STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION EXPENSE THAT WE RECOGNIZE FOR EACH PSU TRANCHE ON A CUMULATIVE BASIS DURING THE REPORTING PERIOD IN WHICH THE TARGET ESTIMATES ARE ALTERED AND MAY CAUSE THE AMOUNT OF STOCK-BASED\nCOMPENSATION EXPENSE THAT WE RECORD FOR SUCH REPORTING PERIOD TO VARY.\nWE RECORD DEFERRED TAX ASSETS FOR STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION AWARDS THAT\nRESULT IN DEDUCTIONS ON OUR INCOME TAX RETURNS, BASED ON THE AMOUNT OF STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION RECOGNIZED AND THE FAIR VALUES ATTRIBUTABLE TO THE VESTED PORTION OF STOCK AWARDS ASSUMED IN CONNECTION WITH A BUSINESS COMBINATION, AT THE STATUTORY TAX\nRATE IN THE JURISDICTION IN WHICH WE WILL RECEIVE A TAX DEDUCTION. BECAUSE THE DEFERRED TAX ASSETS WE RECORD ARE BASED UPON THE STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION EXPENSES IN A PARTICULAR JURISDICTION, THE AFOREMENTIONED INPUTS THAT AFFECT THE FAIR VALUES OF\nOUR STOCK AWARDS MAY ALSO INDIRECTLY AFFECT OUR INCOME TAX EXPENSE. IN ADDITION, DIFFERENCES BETWEEN THE DEFERRED TAX ASSETS RECOGNIZED FOR FINANCIAL REPORTING PURPOSES AND THE ACTUAL TAX DEDUCTION REPORTED ON OUR INCOME TAX RETURNS ARE RECORDED IN\nADDITIONAL PAID-IN CAPITAL.\nTO THE EXTENT WE CHANGE THE TERMS OF OUR EMPLOYEE STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION PROGRAMS, EXPERIENCE MARKET VOLATILITY\nIN THE PRICING OF OUR COMMON STOCK THAT INCREASES THE IMPLIED VOLATILITY CALCULATION OF PUBLICLY TRADED OPTIONS IN OUR STOCK, REFINE DIFFERENT ASSUMPTIONS IN FUTURE PERIODS SUCH AS FORFEITURE RATES OR PSU TARGET PERFORMANCE ATTAINMENT THAT DIFFER\nFROM OUR CURRENT ESTIMATES, OR ASSUME STOCK AWARDS FROM ACQUIRED COMPANIES THAT ARE DIFFERENT IN NATURE THAN OUR STOCK AWARD ARRANGEMENTS, AMONG OTHER POTENTIAL IMPACTS, THE STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION EXPENSE THAT WE RECORD IN FUTURE PERIODS AND THE\nTAX BENEFITS THAT WE REALIZE MAY DIFFER SIGNIFICANTLY FROM WHAT WE HAVE RECORDED IN PREVIOUS REPORTING PERIODS.\nRESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nIMPACT OF ACQUISITIONS\nTHE COMPARABILITY OF OUR OPERATING RESULTS IN FISCAL 2015 COMPARED TO FISCAL 2014 WAS IMPACTED BY OUR ACQUISITIONS, PRIMARILY OUR ACQUISITIONS OF MICROS IN THE SECOND QUARTER OF FISCAL 2015 AND RESPONSYS\nIN THE THIRD QUARTER OF FISCAL 2014.\nTHE COMPARABILITY OF OUR OPERATING RESULTS IN FISCAL 2014 COMPARED TO FISCAL 2013 WAS IMPACTED BY OUR\nACQUISITIONS, PRIMARILY OUR ACQUISITIONS OF RESPONSYS IN THE THIRD QUARTER OF FISCAL 2014, TEKELEC IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF FISCAL 2014 AND ACME PACKET IN THE FOURTH QUARTER OF FISCAL 2013.\nIN OUR DISCUSSION OF CHANGES IN OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS FROM FISCAL 2015 COMPARED TO FISCAL 2014 AND FISCAL 2014 COMPARED TO FISCAL 2013, WE MAY QUALITATIVELY DISCLOSE THE IMPACT OF OUR ACQUIRED\nPRODUCTS AND SERVICES (FOR THE ONE YEAR PERIOD SUBSEQUENT TO THE ACQUISITION DATE) TO THE GROWTH IN CERTAIN OF OUR OPERATING SEGMENTS\u0092 REVENUES WHERE SUCH QUALITATIVE DISCUSSIONS WOULD BE MEANINGFUL FOR AN UNDERSTANDING OF THE FACTORS THAT\nINFLUENCED THE CHANGES IN OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS. WHEN MATERIAL, WE MAY ALSO PROVIDE QUANTITATIVE DISCLOSURES RELATED TO SUCH\n53\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nACQUIRED PRODUCTS AND SERVICES. THE CONTRIBUTIONS OF OUR ACQUISITIONS TO CERTAIN OF OUR OPERATING SEGMENTS\u0092 REVENUES, MARGINS AND EXPENSES FOR EACH OF THE RESPECTIVE PERIOD COMPARISONS\nGENERALLY ARE NOT PROVIDED IN OUR DISCUSSIONS, AS THEY EITHER WERE NOT SEPARATELY IDENTIFIABLE DUE TO THE INTEGRATION OF THESE BUSINESSES AND OPERATING SEGMENTS INTO OUR EXISTING OPERATIONS, AND\/OR WERE INSIGNIFICANT TO OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nDURING THE PERIODS PRESENTED.\nWE CAUTION READERS THAT, WHILE PRE- AND POST-ACQUISITION COMPARISONS, AS WELL AS ANY QUANTIFIED AMOUNTS\nTHEMSELVES, MAY PROVIDE INDICATIONS OF GENERAL TRENDS, ANY ACQUISITION INFORMATION THAT WE PROVIDE HAS INHERENT LIMITATIONS FOR THE FOLLOWING REASONS.\n\u0095\nANY QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE DISCLOSURES CANNOT SPECIFICALLY ADDRESS OR QUANTIFY THE SUBSTANTIAL EFFECTS ATTRIBUTABLE TO CHANGES IN BUSINESS\nSTRATEGIES, INCLUDING OUR SALES FORCE INTEGRATION EFFORTS. WE BELIEVE THAT IF OUR ACQUIRED COMPANIES HAD OPERATED INDEPENDENTLY AND SALES FORCES HAD NOT BEEN INTEGRATED, THE RELATIVE MIX OF PRODUCTS SOLD WOULD HAVE BEEN DIFFERENT; AND\n\u0095\nALTHOUGH SUBSTANTIALLY ALL OF OUR SOFTWARE LICENSE CUSTOMERS, INCLUDING CUSTOMERS FROM ACQUIRED COMPANIES, RENEW THEIR SOFTWARE LICENSE UPDATES AND\nPRODUCT SUPPORT CONTRACTS WHEN THE CONTRACTS ARE ELIGIBLE FOR RENEWAL AND WE STRIVE TO RENEW CLOUD SAAS AND PAAS CONTRACTS AND HARDWARE SYSTEMS SUPPORT CONTRACTS, THE AMOUNTS SHOWN AS CLOUD SAAS AND PAAS DEFERRED REVENUES, SOFTWARE LICENSE UPDATES\nAND PRODUCT SUPPORT DEFERRED REVENUES, AND HARDWARE SYSTEMS SUPPORT DEFERRED REVENUES IN OUR SUPPLEMENTAL DISCLOSURE RELATED TO CERTAIN CHARGES (PRESENTED BELOW) ARE NOT NECESSARILY INDICATIVE OF REVENUE IMPROVEMENTS WE WILL ACHIEVE UPON CONTRACT\nRENEWALS TO THE EXTENT CUSTOMERS DO NOT RENEW.\nCONSTANT CURRENCY PRESENTATION\nOUR INTERNATIONAL OPERATIONS HAVE PROVIDED AND WILL CONTINUE TO PROVIDE A SIGNIFICANT PORTION OF OUR TOTAL REVENUES AND EXPENSES. AS A RESULT, TOTAL\nREVENUES AND EXPENSES WILL CONTINUE TO BE AFFECTED BY CHANGES IN THE U.S. DOLLAR AGAINST MAJOR INTERNATIONAL CURRENCIES. IN ORDER TO PROVIDE A FRAMEWORK FOR ASSESSING HOW OUR UNDERLYING BUSINESSES PERFORMED EXCLUDING THE EFFECTS OF FOREIGN\nCURRENCY FLUCTUATIONS, WE COMPARE THE PERCENT CHANGE IN THE RESULTS FROM ONE PERIOD TO ANOTHER PERIOD IN THIS ANNUAL REPORT USING CONSTANT CURRENCY DISCLOSURE. TO PRESENT THIS INFORMATION, CURRENT AND COMPARATIVE PRIOR PERIOD RESULTS FOR ENTITIES\nREPORTING IN CURRENCIES OTHER THAN U.S. DOLLARS ARE CONVERTED INTO U.S. DOLLARS AT CONSTANT EXCHANGE RATES (I.E., THE RATES IN EFFECT ON MAY 31, 2014, WHICH WAS THE LAST DAY OF OUR PRIOR FISCAL YEAR) RATHER THAN THE ACTUAL EXCHANGE RATES IN\nEFFECT DURING THE RESPECTIVE PERIODS. FOR EXAMPLE, IF AN ENTITY REPORTING IN EUROS HAD REVENUES OF 1.0 MILLION EUROS FROM PRODUCTS SOLD ON MAY 31, 2015 AND 2014, OUR FINANCIAL STATEMENTS WOULD REFLECT REPORTED REVENUES OF $1.08 MILLION IN\nFISCAL 2015 (USING 1.08 AS THE MONTH-END AVERAGE EXCHANGE RATE FOR THE PERIOD) AND $1.36 MILLION IN FISCAL 2014 (USING 1.36 AS THE MONTH-END AVERAGE EXCHANGE RATE FOR THE PERIOD). THE CONSTANT CURRENCY PRESENTATION, HOWEVER, WOULD TRANSLATE THE\nFISCAL 2015 RESULTS USING THE FISCAL 2014 EXCHANGE RATE AND INDICATE, IN THIS EXAMPLE, NO CHANGE IN REVENUES DURING THE PERIOD.

WE ALSO OBTAIN INDIVIDUAL HARDWARE COMPONENTS FOR OUR PRODUCTS FROM A VARIETY OF INDIVIDUAL SUPPLIERS BASED ON PROJECTED DEMAND INFORMATION. SUCH PURCHASE COMMITMENTS ARE BASED ON OUR FORECASTED COMPONENT AND\nMANUFACTURING REQUIREMENTS AND TYPICALLY PROVIDE FOR FULFILLMENT WITHIN AGREED UPON LEAD-TIMES AND\/OR COMMERCIALLY STANDARD LEAD-TIMES FOR THE PARTICULAR PART OR PRODUCT AND HAVE BEEN INCLUDED IN THE AMOUNT PRESENTED IN THE ABOVE CONTRACTUAL\nOBLIGATIONS TABLE.

IN ADDITION, OUR EUROPEAN OPERATIONS GENERALLY PROVIDE LOWER REVENUES IN OUR FIRST FISCAL QUARTER BECAUSE OF THE REDUCED ECONOMIC ACTIVITY IN EUROPE DURING THE SUMMER. THESE SEASONAL FACTORS ARE COMMON IN THE HIGH\nTECHNOLOGY INDUSTRY. THESE FACTORS HAVE CAUSED A DECREASE IN OUR FIRST QUARTER REVENUES AS COMPARED TO REVENUES IN THE IMMEDIATELY PRECEDING FOURTH QUARTER, WHICH HISTORICALLY HAS BEEN OUR HIGHEST REVENUE QUARTER WITHIN A PARTICULAR FISCAL YEAR.\nSIMILARLY, THE OPERATING INCOME OF OUR BUSINESS IS AFFECTED BY SEASONAL FACTORS IN A CONSISTENT MANNER AS OUR REVENUES (IN PARTICULAR, OUR NEW SOFTWARE LICENSES AND CLOUD SOFTWARE SUBSCRIPTIONS SEGMENT) AS CERTAIN EXPENSES WITHIN OUR COST STRUCTURE\nARE RELATIVELY FIXED IN THE SHORT-TERM.

MANY OF THESE REVENUE AND EXPENSES ARE\nDENOMINATED IN CURRENCIES OTHER THAN THE U.S. DOLLAR. AS A RESULT, CHANGES IN FOREIGN EXCHANGE RATES MAY SIGNIFICANTLY AFFECT REVENUE AND EXPENSES.

THE FISCAL\nYEAR 2015 EFFECTIVE RATE INCREASED BY 13%, PRIMARILY DUE TO GOODWILL AND ASSET IMPAIRMENTS AND RESTRUCTURING CHARGES RECORDED IN FISCAL YEAR 2015, MOST OF WHICH DID NOT GENERATE A TAX BENEFIT. OUR EFFECTIVE TAX RATE WAS LOWER THAN THE U.S. FEDERAL\nSTATUTORY RATE PRIMARILY DUE TO FOREIGN EARNINGS TAXED AT LOWER RATES RESULTING FROM PRODUCING AND DISTRIBUTING OUR PRODUCTS AND SERVICES THROUGH OUR FOREIGN REGIONAL OPERATIONS CENTERS IN IRELAND, SINGAPORE, AND PUERTO RICO. IN FISCAL YEAR 2015,\nTHIS REDUCTION WAS MOSTLY OFFSET BY LOSSES IN FOREIGN JURISDICTIONS FOR WHICH WE MAY NOT REALIZE A TAX BENEFIT, PRIMARILY AS A RESULT OF IMPAIRMENT AND RESTRUCTURING CHARGES.\n41\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nPART II\nITEM 7\nCHANGES IN THE MIX OF INCOME BEFORE INCOME TAXES BETWEEN THE U.S. AND FOREIGN COUNTRIES ALSO\nIMPACTED OUR EFFECTIVE TAX RATES AND RESULTED PRIMARILY FROM CHANGES IN THE GEOGRAPHIC DISTRIBUTION OF AND CHANGES IN CONSUMER DEMAND FOR OUR PRODUCTS AND SERVICES.

IN FISCAL YEARS 2015 AND 2014, OUR U.S. INCOME BEFORE INCOME TAXES WAS $7.4 BILLION AND\n$7.1 BILLION, RESPECTIVELY, AND COMPRISED 40% AND 26%, RESPECTIVELY, OF OUR INCOME BEFORE INCOME TAXES. IN FISCAL YEARS 2015 AND 2014, OUR FOREIGN INCOME BEFORE INCOME TAXES WAS $11.1 BILLION AND $20.7 BILLION, RESPECTIVELY, AND COMPRISED 60% AND\n74%, RESPECTIVELY, OF OUR INCOME BEFORE INCOME TAXES.\nTAX CONTINGENCIES AND OTHER INCOME TAX LIABILITIES WERE $12.1 BILLION AND $10.4\nBILLION AS OF JUNE 30, 2015 AND 2014, RESPECTIVELY, AND ARE INCLUDED IN OTHER LONG-TERM LIABILITIES. THIS INCREASE RELATES PRIMARILY TO ADJUSTMENTS TO PRIOR YEARS\u0092 LIABILITIES FOR INTERCOMPANY TRANSFER PRICING AND ADJUSTMENTS RELATED TO\nOUR IRS AUDITS. WHILE WE SETTLED A PORTION OF THE I.R.S. AUDIT FOR TAX YEARS 2004 TO 2006 DURING THE THIRD QUARTER OF FISCAL YEAR 2011, WE REMAIN UNDER AUDIT FOR THOSE YEARS. IN FEBRUARY 2012, THE I.R.S. WITHDREW ITS 2011 REVENUE AGENTS REPORT AND\nREOPENED THE AUDIT PHASE OF THE EXAMINATION. AS OF JUNE 30, 2015, THE PRIMARY UNRESOLVED ISSUE RELATES TO TRANSFER PRICING, WHICH COULD HAVE A SIGNIFICANT IMPACT ON OUR CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS IF NOT RESOLVED FAVORABLY. WE BELIEVE OUR\nALLOWANCES FOR INCOME TAX CONTINGENCIES ARE ADEQUATE. WE HAVE NOT RECEIVED A PROPOSED ASSESSMENT FOR THE UNRESOLVED ISSUES AND DO NOT EXPECT A FINAL RESOLUTION OF THESE ISSUES IN THE NEXT 12 MONTHS. BASED ON THE INFORMATION CURRENTLY AVAILABLE,\nWE DO NOT ANTICIPATE A SIGNIFICANT INCREASE OR DECREASE TO OUR TAX CONTINGENCIES FOR THESE ISSUES WITHIN THE NEXT 12 MONTHS. WE ALSO CONTINUE TO BE SUBJECT TO EXAMINATION BY THE I.R.S. FOR TAX YEARS 2007 TO 2015.\nWE ARE SUBJECT TO INCOME TAX IN MANY JURISDICTIONS OUTSIDE THE U.S. OUR OPERATIONS IN CERTAIN JURISDICTIONS REMAIN SUBJECT TO EXAMINATION FOR TAX\nYEARS 1996 TO 2015, SOME OF WHICH ARE CURRENTLY UNDER AUDIT BY LOCAL TAX AUTHORITIES.

OUR EFFECTIVE TAX RATE WAS LOWER THAN THE U.S. FEDERAL STATUTORY RATE PRIMARILY DUE TO EARNINGS TAXED AT LOWER RATES IN FOREIGN JURISDICTIONS RESULTING FROM PRODUCING AND DISTRIBUTING OUR\nPRODUCTS AND SERVICES THROUGH OUR FOREIGN REGIONAL OPERATIONS CENTERS IN IRELAND, SINGAPORE, AND PUERTO RICO.\nOUR FISCAL YEAR 2014\nEFFECTIVE RATE INCREASED BY 2% FROM FISCAL YEAR 2013 MAINLY DUE TO ADJUSTMENTS OF $458 MILLION TO PRIOR YEARS\u0092 LIABILITIES FOR INTERCOMPANY TRANSFER PRICING THAT INCREASED TAXABLE INCOME IN MORE HIGHLY TAXED JURISDICTIONS, AS WELL AS LOSSES\nINCURRED BY NDS AND CHANGES IN THE GEOGRAPHIC MIX OF OUR BUSINESS. THIS WAS OFFSET IN PART BY FAVORABLE TRANSFER PRICING DEVELOPMENTS IN CERTAIN FOREIGN TAX JURISDICTIONS, PRIMARILY DENMARK.\nCHANGES IN THE MIX OF INCOME BEFORE INCOME TAXES BETWEEN THE U.S. AND FOREIGN COUNTRIES ALSO IMPACTED OUR EFFECTIVE TAX RATES AND RESULTED\nPRIMARILY FROM CHANGES IN THE GEOGRAPHIC DISTRIBUTION OF AND CHANGES IN CONSUMER DEMAND FOR OUR PRODUCTS AND SERVICES. WE SUPPLY OUR WINDOWS PC OPERATING SYSTEM TO CUSTOMERS THROUGH OUR U.S. REGIONAL OPERATING CENTER, WHILE WE SUPPLY THE MICROSOFT\nOFFICE SYSTEM AND OUR SERVER PRODUCTS AND TOOLS TO CUSTOMERS THROUGH OUR FOREIGN REGIONAL OPERATIONS CENTERS. WINDOWS PC OPERATING SYSTEM REVENUE DECREASED $655 MILLION IN FISCAL YEAR 2014, WHILE MICROSOFT OFFICE SYSTEM AND SERVER PRODUCTS AND TOOLS\nREVENUE INCREASED $1.3 BILLION AND $1.6 BILLION, RESPECTIVELY, DURING THIS SAME PERIOD. IN FISCAL YEARS 2014 AND 2013, OUR U.S. INCOME BEFORE INCOME TAXES WAS $7.1 BILLION AND $6.7 BILLION, RESPECTIVELY, AND COMPRISED 26% AND 25%, RESPECTIVELY, OF\nOUR INCOME BEFORE INCOME TAXES. IN FISCAL YEARS 2014 AND 2013, THE FOREIGN INCOME BEFORE INCOME TAXES WAS $20.7 BILLION AND $20.4 BILLION, RESPECTIVELY, AND COMPRISED 74% AND 75%, RESPECTIVELY, OF OUR INCOME BEFORE INCOME TAXES.\nFINANCIAL CONDITION\nCASH, CASH\nEQUIVALENTS, AND INVESTMENTS\nCASH, CASH EQUIVALENTS, AND SHORT-TERM INVESTMENTS TOTALED $96.5 BILLION AS OF JUNE 30, 2015,\nCOMPARED WITH $85.7 BILLION AS OF JUNE 30, 2014. EQUITY AND OTHER INVESTMENTS WERE $12.1 BILLION AS OF JUNE 30, 2015, COMPARED WITH $14.6 BILLION AS OF JUNE 30, 2014.

THEY CONSIST PREDOMINANTLY OF HIGHLY LIQUID INVESTMENT-GRADE FIXED-INCOME SECURITIES, DIVERSIFIED AMONG INDUSTRIES AND INDIVIDUAL ISSUERS. THE INVESTMENTS ARE PREDOMINANTLY U.S.\nDOLLAR-DENOMINATED SECURITIES, BUT ALSO INCLUDE FOREIGN CURRENCY-DENOMINATED SECURITIES IN ORDER TO DIVERSIFY RISK. OUR FIXED-INCOME INVESTMENTS ARE EXPOSED TO INTEREST RATE RISK AND CREDIT RISK. THE CREDIT RISK AND AVERAGE MATURITY OF OUR\nFIXED-INCOME PORTFOLIO ARE MANAGED TO ACHIEVE ECONOMIC RETURNS THAT CORRELATE TO CERTAIN FIXED-INCOME INDICES. THE SETTLEMENT RISK RELATED TO THESE INVESTMENTS IS INSIGNIFICANT GIVEN THAT THE SHORT-TERM INVESTMENTS HELD ARE PRIMARILY HIGHLY LIQUID\nINVESTMENT-GRADE FIXED-INCOME SECURITIES.\nOF THE CASH, CASH EQUIVALENTS, AND SHORT-TERM INVESTMENTS AT JUNE 30, 2015, $94.4\nBILLION WAS HELD BY OUR FOREIGN SUBSIDIARIES AND WOULD BE SUBJECT TO MATERIAL REPATRIATION TAX EFFECTS. THE AMOUNT OF CASH, CASH EQUIVALENTS, AND SHORT-TERM INVESTMENTS HELD BY FOREIGN SUBSIDIARIES SUBJECT TO OTHER RESTRICTIONS ON THE FREE FLOW OF\nFUNDS (PRIMARILY CURRENCY AND OTHER LOCAL REGULATORY) WAS $2.1 BILLION. AS OF JUNE 30, 2015, APPROXIMATELY 79% OF THE CASH EQUIVALENTS AND SHORT-TERM INVESTMENTS HELD BY OUR FOREIGN SUBSIDIARIES WERE INVESTED IN U.S. GOVERNMENT AND AGENCY\nSECURITIES, APPROXIMATELY 5% WERE INVESTED IN CORPORATE NOTES AND BONDS OF U.S. COMPANIES, AND APPROXIMATELY 5% WERE INVESTED IN U.S. MORTGAGE- AND ASSET-BACKED SECURITIES, ALL OF WHICH ARE DENOMINATED IN U.S. DOLLARS.\nSECURITIES LENDING\nWE LEND CERTAIN\nFIXED-INCOME AND EQUITY SECURITIES TO INCREASE INVESTMENT RETURNS. THE LOANED SECURITIES CONTINUE TO BE CARRIED AS INVESTMENTS ON OUR BALANCE SHEET. CASH AND\/OR SECURITY INTERESTS ARE RECEIVED AS COLLATERAL FOR THE LOANED SECURITIES WITH THE AMOUNT\nDETERMINED BASED UPON THE UNDERLYING SECURITY LENT AND THE CREDITWORTHINESS OF THE BORROWER. CASH RECEIVED IS RECORDED AS AN ASSET WITH A CORRESPONDING LIABILITY. OUR SECURITIES LENDING PAYABLE BALANCE WAS $92 MILLION AS OF JUNE 30, 2015. OUR\nAVERAGE AND MAXIMUM SECURITIES LENDING PAYABLE BALANCES FOR THE FISCAL YEAR WERE $287 MILLION AND $750 MILLION, RESPECTIVELY. INTRA-YEAR VARIANCES IN THE AMOUNT OF SECURITIES LOANED ARE MAINLY DUE TO FLUCTUATIONS IN THE DEMAND FOR THE SECURITIES.\nVALUATION\nIN GENERAL, AND\nWHERE APPLICABLE, WE USE QUOTED PRICES IN ACTIVE MARKETS FOR IDENTICAL ASSETS OR LIABILITIES TO DETERMINE THE FAIR VALUE OF OUR FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS. THIS PRICING METHODOLOGY APPLIES TO OUR LEVEL 1 INVESTMENTS, SUCH AS EXCHANGE-TRADED MUTUAL FUNDS,\nDOMESTIC AND INTERNATIONAL EQUITIES, AND U.S. GOVERNMENT SECURITIES. IF QUOTED PRICES IN ACTIVE MARKETS FOR IDENTICAL ASSETS OR LIABILITIES ARE NOT AVAILABLE TO DETERMINE FAIR VALUE, THEN WE USE QUOTED PRICES FOR SIMILAR ASSETS AND LIABILITIES OR\nINPUTS OTHER THAN THE QUOTED PRICES THAT ARE OBSERVABLE EITHER DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY. THIS PRICING METHODOLOGY APPLIES TO OUR LEVEL 2 INVESTMENTS SUCH AS CORPORATE NOTES AND BONDS, COMMON AND PREFERRED STOCK, FOREIGN GOVERNMENT BONDS, MORTGAGE- AND\nASSET-BACKED SECURITIES, U.S. GOVERNMENT AND AGENCY SECURITIES, AND CERTIFICATES OF DEPOSIT. LEVEL 3 INVESTMENTS ARE VALUED USING INTERNALLY DEVELOPED MODELS WITH UNOBSERVABLE INPUTS. ASSETS AND LIABILITIES MEASURED AT FAIR VALUE ON A RECURRING\nBASIS USING UNOBSERVABLE INPUTS ARE AN IMMATERIAL PORTION OF OUR PORTFOLIO.\nA MAJORITY OF OUR INVESTMENTS ARE PRICED BY PRICING VENDORS\nAND ARE GENERALLY LEVEL 1 OR LEVEL 2 INVESTMENTS AS THESE VENDORS EITHER PROVIDE A QUOTED MARKET PRICE IN AN ACTIVE MARKET OR USE OBSERVABLE INPUTS FOR THEIR PRICING WITHOUT APPLYING SIGNIFICANT ADJUSTMENTS. BROKER PRICING IS USED MAINLY WHEN A\nQUOTED PRICE IS NOT AVAILABLE, THE INVESTMENT IS NOT PRICED BY OUR PRICING VENDORS, OR WHEN A BROKER PRICE IS MORE REFLECTIVE OF FAIR VALUES IN THE MARKET IN WHICH THE INVESTMENT TRADES. OUR BROKER-PRICED INVESTMENTS ARE GENERALLY CLASSIFIED AS\nLEVEL 2 INVESTMENTS BECAUSE THE BROKER PRICES THESE INVESTMENTS BASED ON SIMILAR ASSETS WITHOUT APPLYING SIGNIFICANT ADJUSTMENTS. IN ADDITION, ALL OF OUR BROKER-PRICED INVESTMENTS HAVE A SUFFICIENT LEVEL OF TRADING VOLUME TO DEMONSTRATE THAT THE\nFAIR VALUES USED ARE APPROPRIATE FOR THESE INVESTMENTS. OUR FAIR VALUE PROCESSES INCLUDE CONTROLS THAT ARE DESIGNED TO ENSURE APPROPRIATE FAIR VALUES ARE RECORDED. THESE CONTROLS INCLUDE MODEL VALIDATION, REVIEW OF KEY MODEL INPUTS, ANALYSIS OF\nPERIOD-OVER-PERIOD FLUCTUATIONS, AND INDEPENDENT RECALCULATION OF PRICES WHERE APPROPRIATE.\n43\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nPART II\nITEM 7\nCASH FLOWS\nFISCAL YEAR 2015 COMPARED WITH FISCAL YEAR 2014\nCASH FLOWS FROM OPERATIONS DECREASED $3.2 BILLION DURING THE FISCAL YEAR TO $29.1 BILLION, MAINLY DUE TO AN INCREASE IN MATERIALS AND PRODUCTION COSTS IN SUPPORT OF SALES GROWTH AS WELL AS PAYMENTS RELATED TO\nRESTRUCTURING CHARGES AND OTHER CHANGES IN WORKING CAPITAL, OFFSET IN PART BY INCREASES IN CASH RECEIVED FROM CUSTOMERS. CASH USED IN FINANCING INCREASED $686 MILLION TO $9.1 BILLION, MAINLY DUE TO A $7.1 BILLION INCREASE IN CASH USED FOR COMMON\nSTOCK REPURCHASES, OFFSET IN PART BY A $6.7 BILLION INCREASE IN PROCEEDS FROM ISSUANCES OF DEBT, NET OF REPAYMENTS.

WE EXPECT EXISTING DOMESTIC CASH, CASH EQUIVALENTS, SHORT-TERM INVESTMENTS, CASH FLOWS FROM OPERATIONS, AND ACCESS TO CAPITAL\nMARKETS TO CONTINUE TO BE SUFFICIENT TO FUND OUR DOMESTIC OPERATING ACTIVITIES AND CASH COMMITMENTS FOR INVESTING AND FINANCING ACTIVITIES, SUCH AS REGULAR QUARTERLY DIVIDENDS, DEBT MATURITIES, AND MATERIAL CAPITAL EXPENDITURES, FOR AT LEAST THE\nNEXT 12 MONTHS AND THEREAFTER FOR THE FORESEEABLE FUTURE. IN ADDITION, WE EXPECT EXISTING FOREIGN CASH, CASH EQUIVALENTS, SHORT-TERM INVESTMENTS, AND CASH FLOWS FROM OPERATIONS TO CONTINUE TO BE SUFFICIENT TO FUND OUR FOREIGN OPERATING ACTIVITIES\nAND CASH COMMITMENTS FOR INVESTING ACTIVITIES, SUCH AS MATERIAL CAPITAL EXPENDITURES, FOR AT LEAST THE NEXT 12 MONTHS AND THEREAFTER FOR THE FORESEEABLE FUTURE.\nSHOULD WE REQUIRE MORE CAPITAL IN THE U.S. THAN IS GENERATED BY OUR OPERATIONS DOMESTICALLY, FOR EXAMPLE TO FUND SIGNIFICANT DISCRETIONARY ACTIVITIES, SUCH AS BUSINESS ACQUISITIONS AND SHARE REPURCHASES, WE COULD\nELECT TO REPATRIATE FUTURE EARNINGS FROM FOREIGN JURISDICTIONS OR RAISE CAPITAL IN THE U.S. THROUGH DEBT OR EQUITY ISSUANCES. THESE ALTERNATIVES COULD RESULT IN HIGHER EFFECTIVE TAX RATES, INCREASED INTEREST EXPENSE, OR DILUTION OF OUR EARNINGS.

PREPARING CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS REQUIRES MANAGEMENT TO MAKE ESTIMATES AND ASSUMPTIONS THAT AFFECT\nTHE REPORTED AMOUNTS OF ASSETS, LIABILITIES, REVENUE, AND EXPENSES. THESE ESTIMATES AND ASSUMPTIONS ARE AFFECTED BY MANAGEMENT\u0092S APPLICATION OF ACCOUNTING POLICIES. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES FOR US INCLUDE REVENUE RECOGNITION, IMPAIRMENT OF\nINVESTMENT SECURITIES, GOODWILL, RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT COSTS, CONTINGENCIES, INCOME TAXES, AND INVENTORIES.\nREVENUE RECOGNITION\nREVENUE RECOGNITION FOR MULTIPLE-ELEMENT ARRANGEMENTS REQUIRES JUDGMENT TO DETERMINE IF MULTIPLE ELEMENTS EXIST, WHETHER ELEMENTS CAN BE ACCOUNTED\nFOR AS SEPARATE UNITS OF ACCOUNTING, AND IF SO, THE FAIR VALUE FOR EACH OF THE ELEMENTS.\nJUDGMENT IS ALSO REQUIRED TO ASSESS WHETHER\nFUTURE RELEASES OF CERTAIN SOFTWARE REPRESENT NEW PRODUCTS OR UPGRADES AND ENHANCEMENTS TO EXISTING PRODUCTS.

IF IT IS DETERMINED THAT IMPLIED POST-CONTRACT CUSTOMER SUPPORT (\u0093PCS\u0094) IS BEING PROVIDED, REVENUE FROM THE ARRANGEMENT IS\nDEFERRED AND RECOGNIZED OVER THE IMPLIED PCS TERM. IF UPDATES ARE DETERMINED TO NOT MEET THE DEFINITION OF AN UPGRADE, REVENUE IS GENERALLY RECOGNIZED AS PRODUCTS ARE SHIPPED OR MADE AVAILABLE.\nMICROSOFT ENTERS INTO ARRANGEMENTS THAT CAN INCLUDE VARIOUS COMBINATIONS OF SOFTWARE, SERVICES, AND HARDWARE. WHERE ELEMENTS ARE DELIVERED OVER\nDIFFERENT PERIODS OF TIME, AND WHEN ALLOWED UNDER U.S. GAAP, REVENUE IS ALLOCATED TO THE RESPECTIVE ELEMENTS BASED ON THEIR RELATIVE SELLING PRICES AT THE INCEPTION OF THE ARRANGEMENT, AND REVENUE IS RECOGNIZED AS EACH ELEMENT IS DELIVERED. WE USE A\nHIERARCHY TO DETERMINE THE FAIR VALUE TO BE USED FOR ALLOCATING REVENUE TO ELEMENTS: (I) VENDOR-SPECIFIC OBJECTIVE EVIDENCE OF FAIR VALUE (\u0093VSOE\u0094), (II) THIRD-PARTY EVIDENCE, AND (III) BEST ESTIMATE OF SELLING PRICE\n(\u0093ESP\u0094). FOR SOFTWARE ELEMENTS, WE FOLLOW THE INDUSTRY SPECIFIC SOFTWARE GUIDANCE WHICH ONLY ALLOWS FOR THE USE OF VSOE IN ESTABLISHING FAIR VALUE. GENERALLY, VSOE IS THE PRICE CHARGED WHEN THE DELIVERABLE IS SOLD SEPARATELY OR THE PRICE\nESTABLISHED BY MANAGEMENT FOR A PRODUCT THAT IS NOT YET SOLD IF IT IS PROBABLE THAT THE PRICE WILL NOT CHANGE BEFORE INTRODUCTION INTO THE MARKETPLACE. ESPS ARE ESTABLISHED AS BEST ESTIMATES OF WHAT THE SELLING PRICES WOULD BE IF THE DELIVERABLES\nWERE SOLD REGULARLY ON A STAND-ALONE BASIS. OUR PROCESS FOR DETERMINING ESPS REQUIRES JUDGMENT AND CONSIDERS MULTIPLE FACTORS THAT MAY VARY OVER TIME DEPENDING UPON THE UNIQUE FACTS AND CIRCUMSTANCES RELATED TO EACH DELIVERABLE.\nIN JANUARY 2015, WE ANNOUNCED WINDOWS 10 WILL BE FREE TO ALL QUALIFIED EXISTING USERS OF WINDOWS 7 AND WINDOWS 8.1. THIS OFFER DIFFERS FROM\nHISTORICAL OFFERS PRECEDING THE LAUNCH OF NEW VERSIONS OF WINDOWS AS IT IS BEING MADE AVAILABLE FOR FREE TO EXISTING USERS IN ADDITION TO NEW CUSTOMERS AFTER THE OFFER ANNOUNCEMENT. WE EVALUATED THE NATURE AND ACCOUNTING TREATMENT OF THE WINDOWS 10\nOFFER AND DETERMINED THAT IT REPRESENTS A MARKETING AND PROMOTIONAL ACTIVITY, IN PART BECAUSE THE OFFER IS BEING MADE AVAILABLE FOR FREE TO EXISTING USERS. AS THIS IS A MARKETING AND PROMOTIONAL ACTIVITY, REVENUE RECOGNITION OF NEW SALES OF WINDOWS\n8 WILL CONTINUE TO BE RECOGNIZED AS DELIVERED.\nIMPAIRMENT OF INVESTMENT SECURITIES\nWE REVIEW INVESTMENTS QUARTERLY FOR INDICATORS OF OTHER-THAN-TEMPORARY IMPAIRMENT. THIS DETERMINATION REQUIRES SIGNIFICANT JUDGMENT. IN MAKING THIS\nJUDGMENT, WE EMPLOY A SYSTEMATIC METHODOLOGY QUARTERLY THAT CONSIDERS AVAILABLE QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE EVIDENCE IN EVALUATING POTENTIAL IMPAIRMENT OF OUR INVESTMENTS. IF THE COST OF AN INVESTMENT EXCEEDS ITS FAIR VALUE, WE EVALUATE, AMONG\nOTHER FACTORS, GENERAL MARKET CONDITIONS, CREDIT QUALITY OF DEBT INSTRUMENT ISSUERS, THE DURATION AND EXTENT TO WHICH THE FAIR VALUE IS LESS THAN COST, AND FOR EQUITY SECURITIES, OUR INTENT AND ABILITY TO HOLD, OR PLANS TO SELL, THE INVESTMENT. FOR\nFIXED-INCOME SECURITIES, WE ALSO EVALUATE WHETHER WE HAVE PLANS TO SELL THE SECURITY OR IT IS MORE LIKELY THAN NOT THAT WE WILL BE REQUIRED TO SELL THE SECURITY BEFORE RECOVERY. WE ALSO CONSIDER SPECIFIC ADVERSE CONDITIONS RELATED TO THE FINANCIAL\nHEALTH OF AND BUSINESS OUTLOOK FOR THE INVESTEE, INCLUDING INDUSTRY AND SECTOR PERFORMANCE, CHANGES IN TECHNOLOGY, AND OPERATIONAL AND FINANCING CASH FLOW FACTORS. ONCE A DECLINE IN FAIR VALUE IS DETERMINED TO BE OTHER-THAN-TEMPORARY, AN IMPAIRMENT\nCHARGE IS RECORDED TO OTHER INCOME (EXPENSE), NET AND A NEW COST BASIS IN THE INVESTMENT IS ESTABLISHED. IF MARKET, INDUSTRY, AND\/OR INVESTEE CONDITIONS DETERIORATE, WE MAY INCUR FUTURE IMPAIRMENTS.\nGOODWILL\nWE ALLOCATE GOODWILL TO REPORTING\nUNITS BASED ON THE REPORTING UNIT EXPECTED TO BENEFIT FROM THE BUSINESS COMBINATION. WE EVALUATE OUR REPORTING UNITS ON AN ANNUAL BASIS AND, IF NECESSARY, REASSIGN GOODWILL USING A RELATIVE FAIR VALUE ALLOCATION APPROACH. GOODWILL IS TESTED FOR\nIMPAIRMENT AT THE REPORTING UNIT LEVEL (OPERATING SEGMENT OR ONE LEVEL BELOW AN OPERATING SEGMENT) ON AN ANNUAL BASIS (MAY 1 FOR US) AND BETWEEN ANNUAL TESTS IF AN EVENT OCCURS OR CIRCUMSTANCES CHANGE THAT WOULD MORE LIKELY THAN NOT REDUCE THE FAIR\nVALUE OF A REPORTING UNIT BELOW ITS CARRYING VALUE. THESE EVENTS OR CIRCUMSTANCES COULD INCLUDE A SIGNIFICANT CHANGE IN THE BUSINESS CLIMATE, LEGAL FACTORS, OPERATING PERFORMANCE INDICATORS, COMPETITION, OR SALE OR DISPOSITION OF A SIGNIFICANT\nPORTION OF A REPORTING UNIT.\nAPPLICATION OF THE GOODWILL IMPAIRMENT TEST REQUIRES JUDGMENT, INCLUDING THE IDENTIFICATION OF REPORTING\nUNITS, ASSIGNMENT OF ASSETS AND LIABILITIES TO REPORTING UNITS, ASSIGNMENT OF GOODWILL TO REPORTING UNITS, AND DETERMINATION OF THE FAIR VALUE OF EACH REPORTING UNIT. THE FAIR VALUE OF EACH REPORTING UNIT IS ESTIMATED PRIMARILY THROUGH THE USE OF A\n47\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nPART II\nITEM 7\nDISCOUNTED CASH FLOW METHODOLOGY. THIS ANALYSIS REQUIRES SIGNIFICANT JUDGMENTS, INCLUDING ESTIMATION OF FUTURE CASH FLOWS, WHICH IS DEPENDENT ON INTERNAL FORECASTS, ESTIMATION OF THE LONG-TERM\nRATE OF GROWTH FOR OUR BUSINESS, ESTIMATION OF THE USEFUL LIFE OVER WHICH CASH FLOWS WILL OCCUR, AND DETERMINATION OF OUR WEIGHTED AVERAGE COST OF CAPITAL.\nTHE ESTIMATES USED TO CALCULATE THE FAIR VALUE OF A REPORTING UNIT CHANGE FROM YEAR TO YEAR BASED ON OPERATING RESULTS, MARKET CONDITIONS, AND OTHER FACTORS. CHANGES IN THESE ESTIMATES AND ASSUMPTIONS COULD\nMATERIALLY AFFECT THE DETERMINATION OF FAIR VALUE AND GOODWILL IMPAIRMENT FOR EACH REPORTING UNIT.\nBASED ON THE RESULTS OF OUR ANNUAL\nGOODWILL IMPAIRMENT TESTING AS OF MAY 1, 2015, WE DETERMINED THAT GOODWILL ASSOCIATED WITH OUR PHONE HARDWARE REPORTING UNIT WAS IMPAIRED, RESULTING IN A MATERIAL CHARGE TO EARNINGS IN THE FOURTH QUARTER OF FISCAL YEAR 2015. AS OF JUNE 30,\n2015, NONE OF OUR REPORTING UNITS WERE CONSIDERED TO BE AT RISK OF IMPAIRMENT.\nRESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT COSTS\nCOSTS INCURRED INTERNALLY IN RESEARCHING AND DEVELOPING A COMPUTER SOFTWARE PRODUCT ARE CHARGED TO EXPENSE UNTIL TECHNOLOGICAL FEASIBILITY HAS BEEN\nESTABLISHED FOR THE PRODUCT. ONCE TECHNOLOGICAL FEASIBILITY IS ESTABLISHED, ALL SOFTWARE COSTS ARE CAPITALIZED UNTIL THE PRODUCT IS AVAILABLE FOR GENERAL RELEASE TO CUSTOMERS. JUDGMENT IS REQUIRED IN DETERMINING WHEN TECHNOLOGICAL FEASIBILITY OF A\nPRODUCT IS ESTABLISHED. WE HAVE DETERMINED THAT TECHNOLOGICAL FEASIBILITY FOR OUR SOFTWARE PRODUCTS IS REACHED AFTER ALL HIGH-RISK DEVELOPMENT ISSUES HAVE BEEN RESOLVED THROUGH CODING AND TESTING. GENERALLY, THIS OCCURS SHORTLY BEFORE THE PRODUCTS\nARE RELEASED TO MANUFACTURING. THE AMORTIZATION OF THESE COSTS IS INCLUDED IN COST OF REVENUE OVER THE ESTIMATED LIFE OF THE PRODUCTS.\nLEGAL AND\nOTHER CONTINGENCIES\nTHE OUTCOMES OF LEGAL PROCEEDINGS AND CLAIMS BROUGHT AGAINST US ARE SUBJECT TO SIGNIFICANT UNCERTAINTY. AN\nESTIMATED LOSS FROM A LOSS CONTINGENCY SUCH AS A LEGAL PROCEEDING OR CLAIM IS ACCRUED BY A CHARGE TO INCOME IF IT IS PROBABLE THAT AN ASSET HAS BEEN IMPAIRED OR A LIABILITY HAS BEEN INCURRED AND THE AMOUNT OF THE LOSS CAN BE REASONABLY ESTIMATED. IN\nDETERMINING WHETHER A LOSS SHOULD BE ACCRUED WE EVALUATE, AMONG OTHER FACTORS, THE DEGREE OF PROBABILITY OF AN UNFAVORABLE OUTCOME AND THE ABILITY TO MAKE A REASONABLE ESTIMATE OF THE AMOUNT OF LOSS. CHANGES IN THESE FACTORS COULD MATERIALLY IMPACT\nOUR CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.\nINCOME TAXES\nTHE OBJECTIVES OF ACCOUNTING FOR INCOME TAXES ARE TO RECOGNIZE THE AMOUNT OF TAXES PAYABLE OR REFUNDABLE FOR THE CURRENT YEAR AND DEFERRED TAX LIABILITIES AND ASSETS FOR THE FUTURE TAX CONSEQUENCES OF EVENTS THAT\nHAVE BEEN RECOGNIZED IN AN ENTITY\u0092S FINANCIAL STATEMENTS OR TAX RETURNS. WE RECOGNIZE THE TAX BENEFIT FROM AN UNCERTAIN TAX POSITION ONLY IF IT IS MORE LIKELY THAN NOT THAT THE TAX POSITION WILL BE SUSTAINED ON EXAMINATION BY THE TAXING\nAUTHORITIES, BASED ON THE TECHNICAL MERITS OF THE POSITION. THE TAX BENEFITS RECOGNIZED IN THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FROM SUCH A POSITION ARE MEASURED BASED ON THE LARGEST BENEFIT THAT HAS A GREATER THAN 50% LIKELIHOOD OF BEING REALIZED UPON ULTIMATE\nSETTLEMENT. ACCOUNTING LITERATURE ALSO PROVIDES GUIDANCE ON DERECOGNITION OF INCOME TAX ASSETS AND LIABILITIES, CLASSIFICATION OF CURRENT AND DEFERRED INCOME TAX ASSETS AND LIABILITIES, ACCOUNTING FOR INTEREST AND PENALTIES ASSOCIATED WITH TAX\nPOSITIONS, AND INCOME TAX DISCLOSURES. JUDGMENT IS REQUIRED IN ASSESSING THE FUTURE TAX CONSEQUENCES OF EVENTS THAT HAVE BEEN RECOGNIZED IN OUR CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS OR TAX RETURNS. VARIATIONS IN THE ACTUAL OUTCOME OF THESE FUTURE TAX\nCONSEQUENCES COULD MATERIALLY IMPACT OUR CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.\n48\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nPART II\nITEM 7\nINVENTORIES\nINVENTORIES ARE STATED AT AVERAGE COST, SUBJECT TO THE LOWER OF COST OR MARKET. COST INCLUDES MATERIALS, LABOR, AND MANUFACTURING OVERHEAD RELATED TO THE PURCHASE AND PRODUCTION OF INVENTORIES. WE REGULARLY REVIEW\nINVENTORY QUANTITIES ON HAND, FUTURE PURCHASE COMMITMENTS WITH OUR SUPPLIERS, AND THE ESTIMATED UTILITY OF OUR INVENTORY. THESE REVIEWS INCLUDE ANALYSIS OF DEMAND FORECASTS, PRODUCT LIFE CYCLE STATUS, PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT PLANS, CURRENT SALES LEVELS,\nPRICING STRATEGY, AND COMPONENT COST TRENDS. IF OUR REVIEW INDICATES A REDUCTION IN UTILITY BELOW CARRYING VALUE, WE REDUCE OUR INVENTORY TO A NEW COST BASIS THROUGH A CHARGE TO COST OF REVENUE. THE DETERMINATION OF MARKET VALUE AND THE ESTIMATED\nVOLUME OF DEMAND USED IN THE LOWER OF COST OR MARKET ANALYSIS REQUIRE SIGNIFICANT JUDGMENT.\n49\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nPART II\nITEM 7\nSTATEMENT OF MANAGEMENT\u0092S RESPONSIBILITY FOR FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nMANAGEMENT IS RESPONSIBLE FOR THE PREPARATION OF THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND RELATED INFORMATION THAT ARE PRESENTED IN THIS REPORT.\nTHE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS, WHICH INCLUDE AMOUNTS BASED ON MANAGEMENT\u0092S ESTIMATES AND JUDGMENTS, HAVE BEEN PREPARED IN CONFORMITY WITH ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES GENERALLY ACCEPTED IN THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA.\nTHE COMPANY DESIGNS AND MAINTAINS ACCOUNTING AND INTERNAL CONTROL SYSTEMS TO PROVIDE REASONABLE ASSURANCE AT REASONABLE COST THAT ASSETS ARE\nSAFEGUARDED AGAINST LOSS FROM UNAUTHORIZED USE OR DISPOSITION, AND THAT THE FINANCIAL RECORDS ARE RELIABLE FOR PREPARING CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND MAINTAINING ACCOUNTABILITY FOR ASSETS.

IPHONE NET SALES AND UNIT SALES IN 2015 INCREASED IN ALL OF THE COMPANY\u0092S REPORTABLE\nOPERATING SEGMENTS. THE COMPANY ALSO EXPERIENCED YEAR-OVER-YEAR NET SALES INCREASES IN MAC\n\u00ae\n, SERVICES AND OTHER PRODUCTS. APPLE WATCH\n\u00ae\n,\nWHICH LAUNCHED DURING THE THIRD QUARTER OF 2015, ACCOUNTED FOR MORE THAN 100% OF THE YEAR-OVER-YEAR GROWTH IN NET SALES OF OTHER PRODUCTS. NET SALES GROWTH DURING 2015 WAS PARTIALLY OFFSET BY THE EFFECT OF WEAKNESS IN MOST FOREIGN CURRENCIES\nRELATIVE TO THE U.S. DOLLAR AND LOWER IPAD\n\u00ae\nNET SALES. TOTAL NET SALES INCREASED IN EACH OF THE COMPANY\u0092S REPORTABLE OPERATING SEGMENTS, WITH PARTICULARLY STRONG GROWTH IN GREATER CHINA\nWHERE YEAR-OVER-YEAR NET SALES INCREASED 84%.\nIN APRIL 2015, THE COMPANY ANNOUNCED A SIGNIFICANT INCREASE TO ITS CAPITAL RETURN PROGRAM BY RAISING\nTHE EXPECTED TOTAL SIZE OF THE PROGRAM TO $200 BILLION THROUGH MARCH 2017.

THIS WAS DRIVEN BY INCREASES IN NET SALES OF IPHONE, MAC AND SERVICES. NET SALES AND UNIT\nSALES INCREASED FOR IPHONE PRIMARILY DUE TO THE SUCCESSFUL INTRODUCTION OF IPHONE 5S AND 5C IN THE LATTER HALF OF CALENDAR YEAR 2013, THE SUCCESSFUL LAUNCH OF IPHONE 6 AND 6 PLUS BEGINNING IN THE FOURTH QUARTER OF 2014, AND EXPANDED DISTRIBUTION.\nMAC NET SALES AND UNIT SALES INCREASED PRIMARILY DUE TO STRONG DEMAND FOR MACBOOK AIR\n\u00ae\nAND MACBOOK PRO\n\u00ae\nWHICH WERE UPDATED IN 2014 WITH\nFASTER PROCESSORS AND OFFERED AT LOWER PRICES. NET SALES OF SERVICES GREW PRIMARILY DUE TO INCREASED REVENUE FROM SALES THROUGH THE APP STORE\n\u00ae\n, APPLECARE\n\u00ae\nAND LICENSING. GROWTH IN THESE AREAS WAS PARTIALLY OFFSET BY THE YEAR-OVER-YEAR DECLINE IN NET SALES FOR IPAD DUE TO LOWER UNIT SALES IN MANY MARKETS, AND A DECLINE IN NET SALES OF OTHER\nPRODUCTS. ALL OF THE COMPANY\u0092S OPERATING SEGMENTS OTHER THAN THE REST OF ASIA PACIFIC SEGMENT EXPERIENCED INCREASED NET SALES IN 2014, WITH GROWTH BEING STRONGEST IN THE GREATER CHINA AND JAPAN OPERATING SEGMENTS.\nDURING 2014, THE COMPANY COMPLETED VARIOUS BUSINESS ACQUISITIONS, INCLUDING THE ACQUISITIONS OF BEATS MUSIC, LLC, WHICH OFFERS A SUBSCRIPTION STREAMING\nMUSIC SERVICE, AND BEATS ELECTRONICS, LLC, WHICH MAKES BEATS\n\u00ae\nHEADPHONES, SPEAKERS AND AUDIO SOFTWARE.\nAPPLE INC. | 2015 FORM 10-K | 23\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nIN APRIL 2014, THE COMPANY INCREASED ITS SHARE REPURCHASE AUTHORIZATION TO $90 BILLION AND THE QUARTERLY\nDIVIDEND WAS RAISED TO $0.47 PER COMMON SHARE, RESULTING IN AN OVERALL INCREASE IN ITS CAPITAL RETURN PROGRAM FROM $100 BILLION TO OVER $130 BILLION.

THE COMPANY DID NOT RECORD A LIABILITY FOR INFRINGEMENT COSTS RELATED TO INDEMNIFICATION AS OF SEPTEMBER 26, 2015 OR SEPTEMBER 27, 2014.\nAPPLE INC. | 2015 FORM 10-K | 32\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nIN SEPTEMBER 2015, THE COMPANY INTRODUCED THE IPHONE UPGRADE PROGRAM, WHICH IS AVAILABLE TO CUSTOMERS WHO\nPURCHASE AN IPHONE 6S AND 6S PLUS IN ONE OF ITS U.S. PHYSICAL RETAIL STORES AND ACTIVATE THE PURCHASED IPHONE WITH ONE OF THE FOUR NATIONAL CARRIERS. THE IPHONE UPGRADE PROGRAM PROVIDES CUSTOMERS THE RIGHT TO TRADE IN THAT IPHONE FOR A NEW IPHONE,\nPROVIDED CERTAIN CONDITIONS ARE MET. ONE OF THE CONDITIONS OF THIS PROGRAM REQUIRES THE CUSTOMER TO FINANCE THE INITIAL PURCHASE PRICE OF THE IPHONE WITH A THIRD-PARTY LENDER. UPON EXERCISE OF THE TRADE-IN RIGHT AND PURCHASE OF A NEW IPHONE, THE\nCOMPANY SATISFIES THE CUSTOMER\u0092S OUTSTANDING BALANCE DUE TO THE THIRD-PARTY LENDER ON THE ORIGINAL DEVICE. THE COMPANY ACCOUNTS FOR THE TRADE-IN RIGHT AS A GUARANTEE LIABILITY AND RECOGNIZES ARRANGEMENT REVENUE NET OF THE FAIR VALUE OF SUCH\nRIGHT WITH SUBSEQUENT CHANGES TO THE GUARANTEE LIABILITY RECOGNIZED WITHIN REVENUE.\nTHE COMPANY HAS ENTERED INTO INDEMNIFICATION AGREEMENTS WITH ITS\nDIRECTORS AND EXECUTIVE OFFICERS. UNDER THESE AGREEMENTS, THE COMPANY HAS AGREED TO INDEMNIFY SUCH INDIVIDUALS TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW AGAINST LIABILITIES THAT ARISE BY REASON OF THEIR STATUS AS DIRECTORS OR OFFICERS AND TO ADVANCE\nEXPENSES INCURRED BY SUCH INDIVIDUALS IN CONNECTION WITH RELATED LEGAL PROCEEDINGS. IT IS NOT POSSIBLE TO DETERMINE THE MAXIMUM POTENTIAL AMOUNT OF PAYMENTS THE COMPANY COULD BE REQUIRED TO MAKE UNDER THESE AGREEMENTS DUE TO THE LIMITED HISTORY OF\nPRIOR INDEMNIFICATION CLAIMS AND THE UNIQUE FACTS AND CIRCUMSTANCES INVOLVED IN EACH CLAIM. HOWEVER, THE COMPANY MAINTAINS DIRECTORS AND OFFICERS LIABILITY INSURANCE COVERAGE TO REDUCE ITS EXPOSURE TO SUCH OBLIGATIONS.\nCRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES\nTHE PREPARATION OF\nFINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND RELATED DISCLOSURES IN CONFORMITY WITH U.S. GENERALLY ACCEPTED ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES (\u0093GAAP\u0094) AND THE COMPANY\u0092S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF ITS FINANCIAL CONDITION AND OPERATING RESULTS REQUIRE THE\nCOMPANY\u0092S MANAGEMENT TO MAKE JUDGMENTS, ASSUMPTIONS AND ESTIMATES THAT AFFECT THE AMOUNTS REPORTED IN ITS CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND ACCOMPANYING NOTES. NOTE 1, \u0093SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES,\u0094 OF THE NOTES TO\nCONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS IN PART II, ITEM 8 OF THIS FORM 10-K DESCRIBES THE SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND METHODS USED IN THE PREPARATION OF THE COMPANY\u0092S CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS. MANAGEMENT BASES ITS ESTIMATES ON\nHISTORICAL EXPERIENCE AND ON VARIOUS OTHER ASSUMPTIONS IT BELIEVES TO BE REASONABLE UNDER THE CIRCUMSTANCES, THE RESULTS OF WHICH FORM THE BASIS FOR MAKING JUDGMENTS ABOUT THE CARRYING VALUES OF ASSETS AND LIABILITIES. ACTUAL RESULTS MAY DIFFER FROM\nTHESE ESTIMATES, AND SUCH DIFFERENCES MAY BE MATERIAL.\nMANAGEMENT BELIEVES THE COMPANY\u0092S CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES ARE THOSE\nRELATED TO REVENUE RECOGNITION, VALUATION AND IMPAIRMENT OF MARKETABLE SECURITIES, INVENTORY VALUATION AND VALUATION OF MANUFACTURING-RELATED ASSETS AND ESTIMATED PURCHASE COMMITMENT CANCELLATION FEES, WARRANTY COSTS, INCOME TAXES, AND LEGAL AND\nOTHER CONTINGENCIES. MANAGEMENT CONSIDERS THESE POLICIES CRITICAL BECAUSE THEY ARE BOTH IMPORTANT TO THE PORTRAYAL OF THE COMPANY\u0092S FINANCIAL CONDITION AND OPERATING RESULTS, AND THEY REQUIRE MANAGEMENT TO MAKE JUDGMENTS AND ESTIMATES ABOUT\nINHERENTLY UNCERTAIN MATTERS. THE COMPANY\u0092S SENIOR MANAGEMENT HAS REVIEWED THESE CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND RELATED DISCLOSURES WITH THE AUDIT AND FINANCE COMMITTEE OF THE COMPANY\u0092S BOARD OF DIRECTORS.\nREVENUE RECOGNITION\nNET SALES CONSIST PRIMARILY OF REVENUE\nFROM THE SALE OF HARDWARE, SOFTWARE, DIGITAL CONTENT AND APPLICATIONS, ACCESSORIES, AND SERVICE AND SUPPORT CONTRACTS. THE COMPANY RECOGNIZES REVENUE WHEN PERSUASIVE EVIDENCE OF AN ARRANGEMENT EXISTS, DELIVERY HAS OCCURRED, THE SALES PRICE IS FIXED\nOR DETERMINABLE AND COLLECTION IS PROBABLE. PRODUCT IS CONSIDERED DELIVERED TO THE CUSTOMER ONCE IT HAS BEEN SHIPPED AND TITLE, RISK OF LOSS AND REWARDS OF OWNERSHIP HAVE BEEN TRANSFERRED. FOR MOST OF THE COMPANY\u0092S PRODUCT SALES, THESE CRITERIA\nARE MET AT THE TIME THE PRODUCT IS SHIPPED. FOR ONLINE SALES TO INDIVIDUALS, FOR SOME SALES TO EDUCATION CUSTOMERS IN THE U.S., AND FOR CERTAIN OTHER SALES, THE COMPANY DEFERS REVENUE UNTIL THE CUSTOMER RECEIVES THE PRODUCT BECAUSE THE COMPANY\nRETAINS A PORTION OF THE RISK OF LOSS ON THESE SALES DURING TRANSIT. FOR PAYMENT TERMS IN EXCESS OF THE COMPANY\u0092S STANDARD PAYMENT TERMS, REVENUE IS RECOGNIZED AS PAYMENTS BECOME DUE UNLESS THE COMPANY HAS POSITIVE EVIDENCE THAT THE SALES PRICE\nIS FIXED OR DETERMINABLE, SUCH AS A SUCCESSFUL HISTORY OF COLLECTION, WITHOUT CONCESSION, ON COMPARABLE ARRANGEMENTS. THE COMPANY RECOGNIZES REVENUE FROM THE SALE OF HARDWARE PRODUCTS, SOFTWARE BUNDLED WITH HARDWARE THAT IS ESSENTIAL TO THE\nFUNCTIONALITY OF THE HARDWARE AND THIRD-PARTY DIGITAL CONTENT SOLD ON THE ITUNES STORE IN ACCORDANCE WITH GENERAL REVENUE RECOGNITION ACCOUNTING GUIDANCE. THE COMPANY RECOGNIZES REVENUE IN ACCORDANCE WITH INDUSTRY-SPECIFIC SOFTWARE ACCOUNTING\nGUIDANCE FOR THE FOLLOWING TYPES OF SALES TRANSACTIONS: (I) STANDALONE SALES OF SOFTWARE PRODUCTS, (II) SALES OF SOFTWARE UPGRADES AND (III) SALES OF SOFTWARE BUNDLED WITH HARDWARE NOT ESSENTIAL TO THE FUNCTIONALITY OF THE HARDWARE.\nFOR MULTI-ELEMENT ARRANGEMENTS THAT INCLUDE HARDWARE PRODUCTS CONTAINING SOFTWARE ESSENTIAL TO THE HARDWARE PRODUCT\u0092S FUNCTIONALITY,\nUNDELIVERED SOFTWARE ELEMENTS THAT RELATE TO THE HARDWARE PRODUCT\u0092S ESSENTIAL SOFTWARE AND\/OR UNDELIVERED NON-SOFTWARE SERVICES, THE COMPANY ALLOCATES REVENUE TO ALL DELIVERABLES BASED ON THEIR RELATIVE SELLING PRICES. IN SUCH CIRCUMSTANCES,\nTHE COMPANY USES A HIERARCHY TO DETERMINE THE SELLING PRICE TO BE USED FOR ALLOCATING REVENUE TO DELIVERABLES: (I) VENDOR-SPECIFIC OBJECTIVE EVIDENCE OF FAIR VALUE (\u0093VSOE\u0094), (II) THIRD-PARTY EVIDENCE OF SELLING PRICE\n(\u0093TPE\u0094) AND (III) BEST ESTIMATE OF SELLING PRICE (\u0093ESP\u0094). VSOE GENERALLY EXISTS ONLY WHEN THE COMPANY SELLS THE DELIVERABLE SEPARATELY AND IS THE PRICE ACTUALLY CHARGED BY THE COMPANY FOR THAT DELIVERABLE. ESPS REFLECT THE\nCOMPANY\u0092S BEST ESTIMATES OF WHAT THE SELLING PRICES OF ELEMENTS WOULD BE IF THEY WERE SOLD REGULARLY ON A STAND-ALONE BASIS.\nAPPLE INC. | 2015 FORM 10-K | 33\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nFOR SALES OF QUALIFYING VERSIONS OF IOS DEVICES, MAC, APPLE WATCH AND APPLE TV, THE COMPANY HAS INDICATED IT\nMAY FROM TIME TO TIME PROVIDE FUTURE UNSPECIFIED SOFTWARE UPGRADES TO THE DEVICE\u0092S ESSENTIAL SOFTWARE AND\/OR NON-SOFTWARE SERVICES FREE OF CHARGE. BECAUSE THE COMPANY HAS NEITHER VSOE NOR TPE FOR THE UNSPECIFIED SOFTWARE UPGRADE RIGHTS OR THE\nNON-SOFTWARE SERVICES, REVENUE IS ALLOCATED TO THESE RIGHTS AND SERVICES BASED ON THE COMPANY\u0092S ESPS. REVENUE ALLOCATED TO THE UNSPECIFIED SOFTWARE UPGRADE RIGHTS AND NON-SOFTWARE SERVICES BASED ON THE COMPANY\u0092S ESPS IS DEFERRED AND\nRECOGNIZED ON A STRAIGHT-LINE BASIS OVER THE ESTIMATED PERIOD THE SOFTWARE UPGRADES AND NON-SOFTWARE SERVICES ARE EXPECTED TO BE PROVIDED.\nTHE\nCOMPANY\u0092S PROCESS FOR DETERMINING ESPS INVOLVES MANAGEMENT\u0092S JUDGMENT AND CONSIDERS MULTIPLE FACTORS THAT MAY VARY OVER TIME DEPENDING UPON THE UNIQUE FACTS AND CIRCUMSTANCES RELATED TO EACH DELIVERABLE. SHOULD FUTURE FACTS AND\nCIRCUMSTANCES CHANGE, THE COMPANY\u0092S ESPS AND THE FUTURE RATE OF RELATED AMORTIZATION FOR UNSPECIFIED SOFTWARE UPGRADES AND NON-SOFTWARE SERVICES RELATED TO FUTURE SALES OF THESE DEVICES COULD CHANGE. FACTORS SUBJECT TO CHANGE INCLUDE THE\nUNSPECIFIED SOFTWARE UPGRADE RIGHTS AND NON-SOFTWARE SERVICES OFFERED, THE ESTIMATED VALUE OF UNSPECIFIED SOFTWARE UPGRADE RIGHTS AND NON-SOFTWARE SERVICES AND THE ESTIMATED PERIOD UNSPECIFIED SOFTWARE UPGRADES AND NON-SOFTWARE SERVICES ARE EXPECTED\nTO BE PROVIDED.\nTHE COMPANY RECORDS REDUCTIONS TO REVENUE FOR ESTIMATED COMMITMENTS RELATED TO PRICE PROTECTION AND OTHER CUSTOMER INCENTIVE\nPROGRAMS. FOR TRANSACTIONS INVOLVING PRICE PROTECTION, THE COMPANY RECOGNIZES REVENUE NET OF THE ESTIMATED AMOUNT TO BE REFUNDED, PROVIDED THE REFUND AMOUNT CAN BE REASONABLY AND RELIABLY ESTIMATED AND THE OTHER CONDITIONS FOR REVENUE RECOGNITION\nHAVE BEEN MET. THE COMPANY\u0092S POLICY REQUIRES THAT, IF REFUNDS CANNOT BE RELIABLY ESTIMATED, REVENUE IS NOT RECOGNIZED UNTIL RELIABLE ESTIMATES CAN BE MADE OR THE PRICE PROTECTION LAPSES. FOR THE COMPANY\u0092S OTHER CUSTOMER INCENTIVE PROGRAMS,\nTHE ESTIMATED COST IS RECOGNIZED AT THE LATER OF THE DATE AT WHICH THE COMPANY HAS SOLD THE PRODUCT OR THE DATE AT WHICH THE PROGRAM IS OFFERED. THE COMPANY ALSO RECORDS REDUCTIONS TO REVENUE FOR EXPECTED FUTURE PRODUCT RETURNS BASED ON THE\nCOMPANY\u0092S HISTORICAL EXPERIENCE. FUTURE MARKET CONDITIONS AND PRODUCT TRANSITIONS MAY REQUIRE THE COMPANY TO INCREASE CUSTOMER INCENTIVE PROGRAMS THAT COULD RESULT IN REDUCTIONS TO FUTURE REVENUE. ADDITIONALLY, CERTAIN CUSTOMER INCENTIVE\nPROGRAMS REQUIRE MANAGEMENT TO ESTIMATE THE NUMBER OF CUSTOMERS WHO WILL ACTUALLY REDEEM THE INCENTIVE. MANAGEMENT\u0092S ESTIMATES ARE BASED ON HISTORICAL EXPERIENCE AND THE SPECIFIC TERMS AND CONDITIONS OF PARTICULAR INCENTIVE PROGRAMS. IF A\nGREATER THAN ESTIMATED PROPORTION OF CUSTOMERS REDEEMS SUCH INCENTIVES, THE COMPANY WOULD BE REQUIRED TO RECORD ADDITIONAL REDUCTIONS TO REVENUE, WHICH WOULD HAVE AN ADVERSE IMPACT ON THE COMPANY\u0092S OPERATING RESULTS.\nVALUATION AND IMPAIRMENT OF MARKETABLE SECURITIES\nTHE\nCOMPANY\u0092S INVESTMENTS IN AVAILABLE-FOR-SALE SECURITIES ARE REPORTED AT FAIR VALUE. UNREALIZED GAINS AND LOSSES RELATED TO CHANGES IN THE FAIR VALUE OF SECURITIES ARE RECOGNIZED IN ACCUMULATED OTHER COMPREHENSIVE INCOME, NET OF TAX, IN THE\nCOMPANY\u0092S CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS. CHANGES IN THE FAIR VALUE OF AVAILABLE-FOR-SALE SECURITIES IMPACT THE COMPANY\u0092S NET INCOME ONLY WHEN SUCH SECURITIES ARE SOLD OR AN OTHER-THAN-TEMPORARY IMPAIRMENT IS RECOGNIZED. REALIZED GAINS AND\nLOSSES ON THE SALE OF SECURITIES ARE DETERMINED BY SPECIFIC IDENTIFICATION OF EACH SECURITY\u0092S COST BASIS. THE COMPANY REGULARLY REVIEWS ITS INVESTMENT PORTFOLIO TO DETERMINE IF ANY SECURITY IS OTHER-THAN-TEMPORARILY IMPAIRED, WHICH WOULD\nREQUIRE THE COMPANY TO RECORD AN IMPAIRMENT CHARGE IN THE PERIOD ANY SUCH DETERMINATION IS MADE. IN MAKING THIS JUDGMENT, THE COMPANY EVALUATES, AMONG OTHER THINGS, THE DURATION AND EXTENT TO WHICH THE FAIR VALUE OF A SECURITY IS LESS THAN ITS COST;\nTHE FINANCIAL CONDITION OF THE ISSUER AND ANY CHANGES THERETO; AND THE COMPANY\u0092S INTENT TO SELL, OR WHETHER IT WILL MORE LIKELY THAN NOT BE REQUIRED TO SELL, THE SECURITY BEFORE RECOVERY OF ITS AMORTIZED COST BASIS. THE COMPANY\u0092S\nASSESSMENT ON WHETHER A SECURITY IS OTHER-THAN-TEMPORARILY IMPAIRED COULD CHANGE IN THE FUTURE DUE TO NEW DEVELOPMENTS OR CHANGES IN ASSUMPTIONS RELATED TO ANY PARTICULAR SECURITY, WHICH WOULD HAVE AN ADVERSE IMPACT ON THE COMPANY\u0092S OPERATING\nRESULTS.\nINVENTORY VALUATION AND VALUATION OF MANUFACTURING-RELATED ASSETS AND ESTIMATED PURCHASE COMMITMENT CANCELLATION FEES\nTHE COMPANY MUST PURCHASE COMPONENTS AND BUILD INVENTORY IN ADVANCE OF PRODUCT SHIPMENTS AND HAS INVESTED IN MANUFACTURING-RELATED ASSETS, INCLUDING\nCAPITAL ASSETS HELD AT ITS SUPPLIERS\u0092 FACILITIES. IN ADDITION, THE COMPANY HAS MADE PREPAYMENTS TO CERTAIN OF ITS SUPPLIERS ASSOCIATED WITH LONG-TERM SUPPLY AGREEMENTS TO SECURE SUPPLY OF INVENTORY COMPONENTS. THE COMPANY RECORDS A WRITE-DOWN\nFOR INVENTORIES OF COMPONENTS AND PRODUCTS, INCLUDING THIRD-PARTY PRODUCTS HELD FOR RESALE, WHICH HAVE BECOME OBSOLETE OR ARE IN EXCESS OF ANTICIPATED DEMAND OR NET REALIZABLE VALUE. THE COMPANY PERFORMS A DETAILED REVIEW OF INVENTORY THAT CONSIDERS\nMULTIPLE FACTORS INCLUDING DEMAND FORECASTS, PRODUCT LIFE CYCLE STATUS, PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT PLANS, CURRENT SALES LEVELS AND COMPONENT COST TRENDS. THE COMPANY ALSO REVIEWS ITS MANUFACTURING-RELATED CAPITAL ASSETS AND INVENTORY PREPAYMENTS FOR\nIMPAIRMENT WHENEVER EVENTS OR CIRCUMSTANCES INDICATE THE CARRYING AMOUNT OF SUCH ASSETS MAY NOT BE RECOVERABLE. IF THE COMPANY DETERMINES THAT AN ASSET IS NOT RECOVERABLE, IT RECORDS AN IMPAIRMENT LOSS EQUAL TO THE AMOUNT BY WHICH THE CARRYING VALUE\nOF SUCH AN ASSET EXCEEDS ITS FAIR VALUE.\nTHE INDUSTRIES IN WHICH THE COMPANY COMPETES ARE SUBJECT TO A RAPID AND UNPREDICTABLE PACE OF PRODUCT AND\nCOMPONENT OBSOLESCENCE AND DEMAND CHANGES. IN CERTAIN CIRCUMSTANCES THE COMPANY MAY BE REQUIRED TO RECORD ADDITIONAL WRITE-DOWNS OF INVENTORY AND\/OR MANUFACTURING-RELATED ASSETS. THESE CIRCUMSTANCES INCLUDE FUTURE DEMAND OR MARKET CONDITIONS FOR THE\nCOMPANY\u0092S PRODUCTS BEING LESS FAVORABLE THAN FORECASTED, UNFORESEEN TECHNOLOGICAL CHANGES OR CHANGES TO THE COMPANY\u0092S PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT PLANS THAT NEGATIVELY IMPACT THE UTILITY OF ANY OF THESE ASSETS, OR SIGNIFICANT DETERIORATION IN THE\nFINANCIAL CONDITION OF ONE OR MORE OF THE COMPANY\u0092S SUPPLIERS THAT HOLD ANY OF THE COMPANY\u0092S MANUFACTURING-RELATED ASSETS OR TO WHOM THE COMPANY HAS MADE AN INVENTORY PREPAYMENT. SUCH WRITE-DOWNS WOULD ADVERSELY AFFECT THE COMPANY\u0092S\nFINANCIAL CONDITION AND OPERATING RESULTS IN THE PERIOD WHEN THE WRITE-DOWNS WERE RECORDED.\nAPPLE INC. | 2015 FORM 10-K | 34\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nTHE COMPANY ACCRUES FOR ESTIMATED CANCELLATION FEES RELATED TO INVENTORY ORDERS THAT HAVE BEEN CANCELLED OR\nARE EXPECTED TO BE CANCELLED. CONSISTENT WITH INDUSTRY PRACTICE, THE COMPANY ACQUIRES COMPONENTS THROUGH A COMBINATION OF PURCHASE ORDERS, SUPPLIER CONTRACTS, AND OPEN ORDERS IN EACH CASE BASED ON PROJECTED DEMAND. WHERE APPROPRIATE, THE PURCHASES\nARE APPLIED TO INVENTORY COMPONENT PREPAYMENTS THAT ARE OUTSTANDING WITH THE RESPECTIVE SUPPLIER. PURCHASE COMMITMENTS TYPICALLY COVER THE COMPANY\u0092S FORECASTED COMPONENT AND MANUFACTURING REQUIREMENTS FOR PERIODS UP TO 150\nDAYS. IF THERE IS AN ABRUPT AND SUBSTANTIAL DECLINE IN DEMAND FOR ONE OR MORE OF THE COMPANY\u0092S PRODUCTS, A CHANGE IN THE COMPANY\u0092S PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT PLANS, OR AN UNANTICIPATED CHANGE IN TECHNOLOGICAL REQUIREMENTS FOR ANY OF THE\nCOMPANY\u0092S PRODUCTS, THE COMPANY MAY BE REQUIRED TO RECORD ADDITIONAL ACCRUALS FOR CANCELLATION FEES THAT WOULD ADVERSELY AFFECT ITS RESULTS OF OPERATIONS IN THE PERIOD WHEN THE CANCELLATION FEES ARE IDENTIFIED AND RECORDED.\nWARRANTY COSTS\nTHE COMPANY ACCRUES FOR THE ESTIMATED COST OF\nWARRANTIES AT THE TIME THE RELATED REVENUE IS RECOGNIZED BASED ON HISTORICAL AND PROJECTED WARRANTY CLAIM RATES, HISTORICAL AND PROJECTED COST-PER-CLAIM AND KNOWLEDGE OF SPECIFIC PRODUCT FAILURES THAT ARE OUTSIDE OF THE COMPANY\u0092S TYPICAL\nEXPERIENCE. THE COMPANY REGULARLY REVIEWS THESE ESTIMATES TO ASSESS THE ADEQUACY OF ITS RECORDED WARRANTY LIABILITIES OR THE CURRENT INSTALLED BASE OF PRODUCTS SUBJECT TO WARRANTY PROTECTION AND ADJUSTS THE AMOUNTS AS NECESSARY. IF ACTUAL PRODUCT\nFAILURE RATES OR REPAIR COSTS DIFFER FROM ESTIMATES, REVISIONS TO THE ESTIMATED WARRANTY LIABILITIES WOULD BE REQUIRED AND COULD MATERIALLY AFFECT THE COMPANY\u0092S FINANCIAL CONDITION AND OPERATING RESULTS.\nINCOME TAXES\nTHE COMPANY RECORDS A TAX PROVISION FOR THE\nANTICIPATED TAX CONSEQUENCES OF ITS REPORTED OPERATING RESULTS. THE PROVISION FOR INCOME TAXES IS COMPUTED USING THE ASSET AND LIABILITY METHOD, UNDER WHICH DEFERRED TAX ASSETS AND LIABILITIES ARE RECOGNIZED FOR THE EXPECTED FUTURE TAX CONSEQUENCES\nOF TEMPORARY DIFFERENCES BETWEEN THE FINANCIAL REPORTING AND TAX BASES OF ASSETS AND LIABILITIES, AND FOR OPERATING LOSSES AND TAX CREDIT CARRYFORWARDS. DEFERRED TAX ASSETS AND LIABILITIES ARE MEASURED USING THE CURRENTLY ENACTED TAX RATES THAT\nAPPLY TO TAXABLE INCOME IN EFFECT FOR THE YEARS IN WHICH THOSE TAX ASSETS AND LIABILITIES ARE EXPECTED TO BE REALIZED OR SETTLED. THE COMPANY RECORDS A VALUATION ALLOWANCE TO REDUCE DEFERRED TAX ASSETS TO THE AMOUNT THAT IS BELIEVED MORE LIKELY THAN\nNOT TO BE REALIZED.\nTHE COMPANY RECOGNIZES TAX BENEFITS FROM UNCERTAIN TAX POSITIONS ONLY IF IT IS MORE LIKELY THAN NOT THAT THE TAX POSITION WILL\nBE SUSTAINED ON EXAMINATION BY THE TAXING AUTHORITIES, BASED ON THE TECHNICAL MERITS OF THE POSITION. THE TAX BENEFITS RECOGNIZED IN THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FROM SUCH POSITIONS ARE THEN MEASURED BASED ON THE LARGEST BENEFIT THAT HAS A GREATER THAN\n50% LIKELIHOOD OF BEING REALIZED UPON ULTIMATE SETTLEMENT.\nMANAGEMENT BELIEVES IT IS MORE LIKELY THAN NOT THAT FORECASTED INCOME, INCLUDING INCOME\nTHAT MAY BE GENERATED AS A RESULT OF CERTAIN TAX PLANNING STRATEGIES, TOGETHER WITH FUTURE REVERSALS OF EXISTING TAXABLE TEMPORARY DIFFERENCES, WILL BE SUFFICIENT TO FULLY RECOVER THE DEFERRED TAX ASSETS. IN THE EVENT THAT THE COMPANY DETERMINES ALL\nOR PART OF THE NET DEFERRED TAX ASSETS ARE NOT REALIZABLE IN THE FUTURE, THE COMPANY WILL RECORD AN ADJUSTMENT TO THE VALUATION ALLOWANCE THAT WOULD BE CHARGED TO EARNINGS IN THE PERIOD SUCH DETERMINATION IS MADE. IN ADDITION, THE CALCULATION OF TAX\nLIABILITIES INVOLVES SIGNIFICANT JUDGMENT IN ESTIMATING THE IMPACT OF UNCERTAINTIES IN THE APPLICATION OF GAAP AND COMPLEX TAX LAWS. RESOLUTION OF THESE UNCERTAINTIES IN A MANNER INCONSISTENT WITH MANAGEMENT\u0092S EXPECTATIONS COULD HAVE A MATERIAL\nIMPACT ON THE COMPANY\u0092S FINANCIAL CONDITION AND OPERATING RESULTS.\nLEGAL AND OTHER CONTINGENCIES\nAS DISCUSSED IN PART I, ITEM 3 OF THIS FORM 10-K UNDER THE HEADING \u0093LEGAL PROCEEDINGS\u0094 AND IN PART II, ITEM 8 OF THIS FORM 10-K IN THE\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS IN NOTE 10, \u0093COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES,\u0094 THE COMPANY IS SUBJECT TO VARIOUS LEGAL PROCEEDINGS AND CLAIMS THAT ARISE IN THE ORDINARY COURSE OF BUSINESS. THE COMPANY RECORDS A LIABILITY WHEN IT\nIS PROBABLE THAT A LOSS HAS BEEN INCURRED AND THE AMOUNT IS REASONABLY ESTIMABLE. THERE IS SIGNIFICANT JUDGMENT REQUIRED IN BOTH THE PROBABILITY DETERMINATION AND AS TO WHETHER AN EXPOSURE CAN BE REASONABLY ESTIMATED. IN THE OPINION OF MANAGEMENT,\nTHERE WAS NOT AT LEAST A REASONABLE POSSIBILITY THE COMPANY MAY HAVE INCURRED A MATERIAL LOSS, OR A MATERIAL LOSS IN EXCESS OF A RECORDED ACCRUAL, WITH RESPECT TO LOSS CONTINGENCIES FOR ASSERTED LEGAL AND OTHER CLAIMS. HOWEVER, THE OUTCOME OF LEGAL\nPROCEEDINGS AND CLAIMS BROUGHT AGAINST THE COMPANY IS SUBJECT TO SIGNIFICANT UNCERTAINTY. THEREFORE, ALTHOUGH MANAGEMENT CONSIDERS THE LIKELIHOOD OF SUCH AN OUTCOME TO BE REMOTE, IF ONE OR MORE OF THESE LEGAL MATTERS WERE RESOLVED AGAINST THE\nCOMPANY IN A REPORTING PERIOD FOR AMOUNTS IN EXCESS OF MANAGEMENT\u0092S EXPECTATIONS, THE COMPANY\u0092S CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR THAT REPORTING PERIOD COULD BE MATERIALLY ADVERSELY AFFECTED.\nAPPLE INC. | 2015 FORM 10-K | 35\nTABLE OF CONTENTS"}}
