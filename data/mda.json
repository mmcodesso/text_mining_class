7.\nMANAGEMENT\u2019S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF\nOPERATIONS\nINTRODUCTION\nManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements of ACCO Brands Corporation and the accompanying notes contained in Part II, Item 8. of this report. Unless otherwise noted, the following discussion pertains only to our continuing operations.\nOverview of the Company\nACCO Brands is one of the world's largest designers, marketers and manufacturers of branded business, academic and selected consumer products. Our widely recognized brands include Artline\n\u00ae\n, AT-A-GLANCE\n\u00ae\n, Derwent\n\u00ae\n,\nEsselte\n\u00ae\n, Five Star\n\u00ae\n, GBC\n\u00ae\n, Hilroy\n\u00ae\n, Kensington\n\u00ae\n, Leitz\n\u00ae\n, Marbig\n\u00ae\n, Mead\n\u00ae\n, NOBO\n\u00ae\n, Quartet\n\u00ae\n, Rapid\n\u00ae\n, Rexel\n\u00ae\n, Swingline\n\u00ae\n, Tilibra\n\u00ae\n, Wilson Jones\n\u00ae\nand many others. More than 80% of our net sales come from brands that occupy the number one or number two positions in the select product categories in which we compete. We seek to develop new products that meet the needs of our consumer and commercial end-users. We compete through a balance of product innovation, category management, a low-cost operating model and an efficient supply chain. We sell our products to consumers and commercial end-users primarily through resellers, including wholesalers and retailers, on-line retailers, and traditional office supply resellers. Our products are sold primarily to markets located in the U.S., Northern Europe, Australia, Canada, Brazil and Mexico.\nFor the year ended\nDecember 31, 2016\n, approximately\n43%\nof our sales were outside the U.S., up from\n40%\nin\n2015.\nThe majority of our revenue is concentrated in geographies where demand for our product categories is in mature stages, but we see opportunities to grow sales through share gains, channel expansion and new products. Over the long-term we expect to derive growth in faster growing emerging geographies where demand in the product categories in which we compete is strong, such as in Latin America and parts of Asia, the Middle East and Eastern Europe. We plan to grow organically, supplemented by strategic acquisitions in both existing and adjacent categories. Historically, key drivers of demand for our products have included trends in white-collar employment levels, education enrollment levels, gross domestic product (GDP), growth in the number of small businesses and home offices, as well as consumer usage trends for our product categories.\nWe believe our leading product positions provide the scale to enable us to invest in product innovation and drive growth across our product categories. We currently manufacture approximately half of our products locally where we operate, and source approximately half of our products, primarily from China.\nPelikan Artline Joint-Venture Acquisition\nOn May 2, 2016, the Company completed the PA Acquisition. Prior to the PA Acquisition, the Company's investment in the Pelikan Artline joint-venture was accounted for under the equity method. The results of Pelikan Artline joint-venture are included in the Company's consolidated financial statements from the date of the PA Acquisition, May 2, 2016.\nPelikan Artline's product categories include writing instruments, notebooks, binding and lamination, visual communication, cleaning and janitorial supplies, as well as general stationery. Its industry-leading brands include Artline\n\u00ae\n, Quartet\n\u00ae,\nGBC\n\u00ae\n, Spirax\n\u00ae\nand Texta\n\u00ae\n, among others.\nThe PA Acquisition was financed through a borrowing of\nA$100.0 million\n(US\n$76.6 million\nbased on May 2, 2016 exchange rates) under our credit facilities. For further information on the financing see also \"\nNote 4. Long-term Debt and Short-term Borrowings\n\" to the consolidated financial statements contained in Item 8. of this report.\nDuring 2016, we recognized a\n$28.9 million\ngain in connection with the PA Acquisition due to the revaluation of the Company's previously held equity interest in the Pelikan Artline joint-venture. This amount was reported in \"\nOther expense, net\n.\" For further information on the PA Acquisition see also \"\nNote 3. Acquisition\n\" to the consolidated financial statements contained in Item 8. of this report.\nReportable Segments\nACCO Brands North America and ACCO Brands International\nACCO Brands North America and ACCO Brands International design, market, source, manufacture and sell traditional office products, academic supplies and calendar products. ACCO Brands North America comprises the U.S. and Canada, and ACCO Brands International comprises the rest of the world, primarily Northern Europe, Australia, Brazil and Mexico.\n25\nOur business, academic and calendar product lines use name brands such as Artline\n\u00ae\n, AT-A-GLANCE\n\u00ae\n, Derwent\n\u00ae\n, Esselte\n\u00ae\n, Five Star\n\u00ae\n, GBC\n\u00ae\n, Hilroy\n\u00ae\n, Leitz\n\u00ae\n, Marbig\n\u00ae\n, Mead\n\u00ae\n, NOBO\n\u00ae\n, Quartet\n\u00ae\n, Rapid\n\u00ae\n, Rexel\n\u00ae\n, Swingline\n\u00ae\n, Tilibra\n\u00ae\n, Wilson Jones\n\u00ae\nand many others. Products and brands are not confined to one channel or product category and are sold based on end-user preference in each geographic location.\nThe majority of our office products, such as stapling, binding and laminating equipment and related consumable supplies, shredders and whiteboards, are used by businesses. Most of these end-users purchase their products from our customers, which include traditional office supply resellers, wholesalers and other retailers, including on-line retailers. We supply some of our products directly to large commercial and industrial end-users, and provide business machine maintenance and certain repair services. Additionally, we supply some similar private label products.\nOur academic products include notebooks, folders, decorative calendars and stationery products. We distribute our academic products primarily through mass merchandisers and other retailers, such as grocery, drug and office superstores, as well as on-line retailers. We also distribute to small independent retailers in emerging markets and supply some private label academic products.\nOur calendar products are sold through all the same channels where we sell business or academic products, as well as directly to consumers, both on-line and through direct mail.\nOur customers are primarily large global and regional resellers of our products including traditional office supply resellers, wholesalers, on-line retailers and other retailers. Mass merchandisers and retail channels primarily sell to individual consumers but also to small businesses. We also sell to office supply retailers, commercial contract dealers, wholesalers, distributors and independent dealers who primarily serve commercial end-users. Over half of our product sales by our customers are to commercial end-users, who generally seek premium products that have added value or ease-of-use features and a reputation for reliability, performance and professional appearance. Some of our binding and laminating equipment products are sold directly to high-volume end-users and commercial reprographic centers. We also sell directly to consumers.\nComputer Products Group\nOur Computer Products Group designs, sources, distributes, markets and sells accessories for laptop and desktop computers and tablets. These accessories primarily include security products, input devices such as presenters, mice and trackballs, ergonomic aids such as foot and wrist rests, docking stations, and other PC and tablet accessories. We sell these products mostly under the Kensington\n\u00ae\n, Microsaver\n\u00ae\nand ClickSafe\n\u00ae\nbrand names, with the majority of revenue coming from the U.S. and Northern Europe. Our computer products are manufactured by third-party suppliers, principally in Asia, and are distributed from our regional facilities. Our computer products are sold primarily to consumer electronics retailers, information technology value-added resellers, original equipment manufacturers, and office products retailers, as well as directly to consumers on-line.\nOverview of\n2016\nCompany Performance\nIn 2016, the Company effectively executed against its business strategy, including increasing penetration in growing channels, strategic acquisitions and effective management of its capital structure and deployment of operating cash flow.\nSpecifically, net sales increased\n3%\nto\n$1.56 billion\ncompared to\n$1.51 billion\nin the prior-year period. The PA Acquisition, which was completed on May 2, 2016, contributed\n5%\nto sales. Foreign currency translation reduced sales by\n1%\n. The underlying decline in sales was primarily due to\ndeclines at certain wholesalers and office superstores customers\n, partially offset by strong growth with mass channel and e-tail customers. Net income was\n$95.5 million\n, or\n$0.87\nper share, compared to net income of\n$85.9 million\n, or\n$0.78\nper share, in the prior-year period. The increase was primarily due to the lower effective tax rate for 2016.\nDuring 2016, the company entered into two new financing arrangements. The first refinancing was in connection with the PA Acquisition. In addition, in December 2016, the Company refinanced its Senior Unsecured Notes at a lower interest rate, extending the maturity of the debt an additional 4 years to 2024.\nIn connection with the PA Acquisition and the Esselte Acquisition, announced in October 2016, the Company incurred\n$12.8 million\nof transaction and integration costs in 2016.\nForeign Currency\nThe strong U.S. dollar impacted our 2016 results from both a translation and transaction perspective. With respect to translation the strong U.S. dollar decreased our 2016 reported sales by\n$16.9 million\n, or\n1%\n, but slightly benefited our operating income.\n26\nForeign currency translation increased operating income by\n$1.6 million\n, or\n1%\n, due to the seasonality of our Brazilian business, which earns most of its income in the fourth quarter when the Brazilian real strengthened.\nWith respect to the transaction impact, in response to the strengthening of the U.S. dollar during both the second half of 2015 and into 2016, we implemented price increases in 2016 in certain foreign markets in an effort to recover our lost gross margin. Due to competitive pressures and the timing of these price increases relative to changes in currency exchange rates, we were not able to increase our prices enough to fully offset the cumulative impact of the foreign exchange related inflation on our cost of products sold in these markets.\nThe annual average foreign exchange rates have moved as follows for our major currencies relative to the U.S. dollar.\n2016 Average Versus 2015 Average\n2015 Average Versus 2014 Average\nCurrency\nIncrease\/(Decline)\nIncrease\/(Decline)\nBrazilian real\n(6)%\n(28)%\nEuro\n\u2014%\n(17)%\nCanadian dollar\n(4)%\n(14)%\nAustralian dollar\n(1)%\n(17)%\nMexican peso\n(15)%\n(16)%\nBritish pound\n(11)%\n(7)%\nJapanese yen\n11%\n(13)%\nFluctuations in the currency exchange rates can also have a material impact on our Consolidated Balance Sheet. The strengthening of the U.S. dollar has reduced the value of our reported assets and liabilities by\n$16.8 million\nversus\nDecember 31, 2015\n. Therefore, our reported shareholders' equity has decreased by this amount.\nWe expect the adverse effects from the strong U.S. dollar to continue to impact us in 2017.

Derivative Financial Instruments\n\" to the consolidated financial statements contained in Item 8. of this report.\nSenior Unsecured Notes\nOn December 22, 2016, the Company completed a private offering of $400.0 million in aggregate principal amount of 5.25% senior unsecured notes due December 2024 (the \"New Notes\") which were issued under an indenture, dated December 22, 2016 (the \"New Indenture\"), among the Company, as issuer, the guarantors named therein (the \"Guarantors\") and Wells Fargo Bank, National Association, as trustee (the \"Trustee\").\nIn addition, effective December 22, 2016, the Company irrevocably deposited with the trustee of its 6.75% Senior Notes due 2020 (the \"Existing Notes\") an amount necessary to pay the aggregate redemption price for the Existing Notes, and satisfied and discharged all its obligations related to the Existing Notes indenture. The Company borrowed\n$73.9 million\nunder its revolving credit facility and applied the funds, together with the net proceeds from the issuance of the New Notes and cash on hand, toward the payment of the redemption price for all of the Existing Notes. The aggregate redemption price of\n$531.5 million\n, consisted of principal due and payable on the Existing Notes, a \"make-whole\" call premium of\n$25.0 million\n(included in \"\nOther expense, net\n\"), and accrued and unpaid interest of\n$6.5 million\n(included in \"\nInterest expense\n\").\nAlso included in \"\nOther expense, net\n\" is a\n$4.9 million\ncharge for the write-off of debt issuance costs associated with the Existing Notes. Additionally, we incurred and capitalized approximately\n$6.1 million\nin bank, legal and other fees associated with the issuance of the New Notes.\nFor further information on the refinancing of our Existing Notes and the issuance of the New Notes see \"\nNote 4. Long-term Debt and Short-term Borrowings\n\" to the consolidated financial statements contained in Item 8. of this report.\n27\nFiscal\n2016\nversus Fiscal\n2015\nThe following table presents the Company\u2019s results for the years ended\nDecember 31, 2016\n, and\n2015.\nYear Ended December 31,\nAmount of Change\n(in millions of dollars, except per share data)\n2016\n(1)\n2015\n$%\nNet sales\n$1,557.1\n$1,510.4\n$46.7\n3%\nCost of products sold\n1,042.0\n1,032.0\n10.0\n1%\nGross profit\n515.1\n478.4\n36.7\n8%\nGross profit margin\n33.1%\n31.7%\n1.4\npts\nAdvertising, selling, general and administrative expenses\n320.8\n295.7\n25.1\n8%\nAmortization of intangibles\n21.6\n19.6\n2.0\n10%\nRestructuring charges (credits)\n5.4\n(0.4\n)\n5.8\nNM\nOperating income\n167.3\n163.5\n3.8\n2%\nOperating income margin\n10.7%\n10.8%\n(0.1)\npts\nInterest expense\n49.3\n44.5\n4.8\n11%\nInterest income\n(6.4\n)\n(6.6\n)\n0.2\n(3\n)%\nEquity in earnings of joint ventures\n(2.1\n)\n(7.9\n)\n5.8\n(73\n)%\nOther expense, net\n1.4\n2.1\n(0.7\n)\n(33\n)%\nIncome tax expense\n29.6\n45.5\n(15.9\n)\n(35\n)%\nEffective tax rate\n23.7%\n34.6%\n(10.9)\npts\nNet income\n95.5\n85.9\n9.6\n11%\nWeighted average number of diluted shares outstanding.\n109.2\n110.6\n(1.4\n)\n(1\n)%\nDiluted income per share\n0.87\n0.78\n0.09\n12%\n(1)\nThe Company acquired Pelikan Artline on May 2, 2016, the results of which are included in 2016 results only from that date forward.\nNet Sales\nNet sales increased\n$46.7 million\n, or\n3%\n, to\n$1,557.1 million\nfrom\n$1,510.4 million\nin the prior-year period. The PA Acquisition contributed sales of\n$78.5 million\n, or\n5%\n. Foreign currency translation reduced sales by\n$16.9 million\n, or\n1%\n. The underlying sales decrease was due to\ndeclines at certain wholesalers and office superstores customers\n, partially offset by strong growth at mass and e-tail customers.\nCost of Products Sold\nCost of products sold includes all manufacturing, product sourcing and distribution costs, including depreciation related to assets used in the manufacturing, procurement and distribution process, allocation of certain information technology costs supporting those processes, inbound and outbound freight, shipping and handling costs, purchasing costs associated with materials and packaging used in the production processes and inventory valuation adjustments. Cost of products sold increased\n$10.0 million\n, or\n1%\n, to\n$1,042.0 million\n, from\n$1,032.0 million\nin the prior-year period. The PA Acquisition contributed\n$47.7 million\nto increased cost of products sold. Foreign currency translation reduced cost of products sold by\n$13.3 million\n, or\n1%\n. The underlying decline was due to lower sales volume, cost savings and productivity improvements, partially offset by foreign-exchange-related inflationary increases in certain foreign markets' cost of products sold.\nGross Profit\nManagement believes that gross profit and gross profit margin provide enhanced shareholder appreciation of underlying profit drivers. Gross profit increased\n$36.7 million\n, or\n8%\n, to\n$515.1 million\n, from\n$478.4 million\nin the prior-year period. The PA Acquisition increased gross profit by\n$30.8 million\n. Foreign currency translation reduced gross profit by\n$3.6 million\n, or\n1%\n. The underlying increase was due to higher pricing, cost savings and productivity improvements, which were partially offset by foreign-exchange-related inflationary increases in certain foreign markets' costs of products sold.\n28\nGross profit margin increased to\n33.1%\nfrom\n31.7%\n. The increase was primarily due to cost savings and productivity improvements, higher pricing and the positive impact of the PA Acquisition.\nAdvertising, selling, general and administrative expenses\nAdvertising, selling, general and administrative expenses (\"SG&A\") include advertising, marketing, selling (including commissions), research and development, customer service, depreciation related to assets outside the manufacturing and distribution processes and all other general and administrative expenses outside the manufacturing and distribution functions (e.g., finance, human resources, information technology and corporate expenses). SG&A increased\n$25.1 million\n, or\n8%\n, to\n$320.8 million\nfrom\n$295.7 million\nin the prior-year period. The PA Acquisition increased SG&A by\n$16.6 million\n, including\n$3.6 million\nof costs related to the PA Acquisition. Foreign currency translation reduced SG&A by\n$4.8 million\n, or\n2%\n. The underlying increase was driven by higher professional fees, including $9.2 million related to the recently announced Esselte Acquisition. Additionally, the prior year benefited from a one-time $2.3 million benefit from the recovery of an indirect tax in Brazil.\nAs a percentage of sales, SG&A increased to\n20.6%\nfrom\n19.6%\nin the prior-year period, for the reasons mentioned above.\nRestructuring Charges (Credits)\nThe Company initiated cost reduction plans related to the consolidation and integration of Pelikan Artline with our already existing Australian and New Zealand businesses, and as a result incurred\n$4.2 million\nin charges, primarily related to severance. In addition, the Company initiated additional cost reduction plans and incurred $1.2 million in severance charges related to the consolidation of certain functions in the North America segment.\nOperating Income\nOperating income increased\n$3.8 million\n, or\n2%\n, to\n$167.3 million\n, from\n$163.5 million\nin the prior-year period. Foreign currency translation increased operating income by\n$1.6 million\n, or\n1%\n. The underlying increase was due to the PA Acquisition, partially offset by increased SG&A and restructuring charges.\nInterest Expense and Other Expense, Net\nInterest expense\nincreased\n$4.8 million\n, or\n11%\n, to\n$49.3 million\nfrom\n$44.5 million\nin the prior-year period. The increase was primarily due to additional debt incurred to finance the PA Acquisition and the early refinancing of our Existing Notes, in which the Company incurred\n$2.5 million\nof incremental interest expense. Also contributing to the increase was the accelerated amortization of debt issuance cost related to the prepayment of $70 million on our U.S. Dollar Senior Secured Term Loan A.\nOther expense, net\ndecreased by\n$0.7 million\nto\n$1.4 million\nfrom\n$2.1 million\nin the prior-year period. The current year included charges associated with the refinancing of our Existing Notes. The charges consisted of\n$25.0 million\nin a \"make-whole\" call premium and a\n$4.9 million\ncharge for the write-off of debt issuance costs, which were offset by a\n$28.9 million\ngain arising from the PA Acquisition due to the revaluation of the Company's previously held equity interest to fair value and a $1.0 million gain on the settlement of an intercompany loan, previously deemed permanently invested. In the prior year we wrote-off $1.9 million of debt issuance costs related to the refinancing completed in 2015.\nIncome Taxes\nIncome tax expense was\n$29.6 million\non income before taxes of\n$125.1 million\n, with an effective tax rate of\n23.7%\n. For the prior-year period, income tax expense was\n$45.5 million\non income before taxes of\n$131.4 million\n, with an effective tax rate of\n34.6%\n. The lower effective tax rate in the current year period was primarily due to the following: 1) the\n$28.9 million\ngain from the PA Acquisition due to the revaluation of the previously held equity interest to fair value, which was not subject to tax, and 2) tax losses on foreign exchange on the repayment of intercompany loans, for which the pre-tax effect was recorded in equity.\nNet Income\nNet income increased\n$9.6 million\n, or\n11%\n, to\n$95.5 million\nor\n$0.87\nper diluted share, from\n$85.9 million\n, or\n$0.78\nper diluted share in the prior-year period.

Foreign currency translation reduced sales by\n$3.9 million\n, or\n0.4%\n. The underlying sales decrease was primarily due to declines at certain wholesalers and an office products superstore due to inventory destocking and consumers purchasing in different channels. This was partially offset by strong back-to-school sales, notably with mass-market customers and on-line retailers, due to increased product placements and broadened product offerings.\nACCO Brands North America operating income increased\n$3.0 million\n, or\n2%\n, to\n$150.6 million\nfrom\n$147.6 million\nin the prior-year period, and operating income margin increased to\n15.8%\nfrom\n15.3%\n. Foreign currency translation reduced operating income by\n$0.3 million\n, or\n0.2%\n. The underlying improvement was driven by cost savings and productivity improvements.\nACCO Brands International\nACCO Brands International net sales increased\n$58.1 million\n, or\n14%\n, to\n$485.0 million\nfrom\n$426.9 million\nin the prior-year period. The PA Acquisition contributed sales of\n$78.5 million\n, or\n18%\n. Foreign currency translation reduced sales by\n$11.8 million\n, or\n3%\n. The underlying sales decrease was due to lower volume as a result of the ongoing channel destocking, most notably in Europe, as well as lost share with some customers and lower consumer demand. Partially offsetting the sales decline was price increases, which benefited sales by\n8%\n. Price increases were implemented to recover gross margins following foreign-exchange-related cost of products sold increases, particularly in Mexico as well as to offset paper related inflation in Brazil.\nACCO Brands International operating income increased\n$12.3 million\n, or\n30%\n, to\n$53.1 million\nfrom\n$40.8 million\nin the prior-year period, and operating income margin increased to\n10.9%\nfrom\n9.6%\n. The PA Acquisition contributed operating income of\n$6.9 million\n, net of\n$4.2 million\nof restructuring charges and\n$2.3 million\nof integration expenses. Foreign currency translation increased operating income by\n$1.7 million\n, or\n4%\n, due to the recovery of the Brazilian real, which occurred in the seasonally stronger fourth quarter. The underlying increase was due to higher pricing and productivity improvements, partially offset by lower volumes. In addition, the prior year results included a one-time $2.3 million recovery of an indirect tax and $1.3 million of severance charges, both in Brazil.\n30\nComputer Products Group\nComputer Products Group net sales decreased\n$3.6 million\n, or\n3%\n, to\n$116.6 million\nfrom\n$120.2 million\nin the prior-year period. Foreign currency translation reduced sales by\n$1.2 million\n, or\n1%\n. Increased sales of PC accessory products were offset by lower sales of tablet accessories.\nComputer Products Group operating income increased\n$1.3 million\n, or\n13%\n, to\n$11.6 million\nfrom\n$10.3 million\nin the prior-year period, and operating margin increased to\n9.9%\nfrom\n8.6%\n. Foreign currency translation increased operating income by\n$0.2 million\n, or\n2%\n. Operating income and margin increased due to higher pricing in international markets and a favorable product mix driven by lower sales of tablet accessories.

Foreign currency translation reduced sales by $123.9 million, or 7%. The underlying sales declined in all segments, but primarily in the International and North America segments. Within the International segment, sales volume declined in most of our markets, partially offset by price increases. Brazil accounted for $61.7 million of our total sales decline. Underlying sales decreased by $21.6 million due to the on-going deterioration of economic conditions, and currency translation reduced sales by $40.1 million. North America declined primarily due to lower sales to office superstores driven by the loss of product placement and continuing impact of distribution center and store closures.\nCost of Products Sold\nCost of products sold includes all manufacturing, product sourcing and distribution costs, including depreciation related to assets used in the manufacturing, procurement and distribution process, allocation of certain information technology costs supporting those processes, inbound and outbound freight, shipping and handling costs, purchasing costs associated with materials and packaging used in the production processes and inventory valuation adjustments. Cost of products sold decreased $127.3 million, or 11%, to $1,032.0 million, from $1,159.3 million in the prior-year period. Foreign currency translation reduced cost of products sold by $88.2 million, or 8%. The underlying decline was driven by lower sales volume, cost savings and productivity\n31\nimprovements (primarily in the North America segment), partially offset by foreign-exchange-related increases in cost of products sold at our foreign business units that source their inventory in U.S. dollars.\nGross Profit\nManagement believes that gross profit and gross profit margin provide enhanced shareholder appreciation of underlying profit drivers. Gross profit decreased $51.5 million, or 10%, to $478.4 million, from $529.9 million in the prior-year period. Foreign currency translation reduced gross profit by $35.7 million, or 7%. The underlying decrease was primarily due to lower sales.\nGross profit margin increased to 31.7% from 31.4%. The increase was primarily due to cost savings and productivity improvements, which more than offset the adverse impact of unfavorable sales mix and deleveraging from lower volumes. Higher pricing primarily offset the increased cost of goods sourced as a result of the strong U.S. dollar.\nAdvertising, selling, general and administrative expenses\nAdvertising, selling, general and administrative expenses (\"SG&A\") include advertising, marketing, selling (including commissions), research and development, customer service, depreciation related to assets outside the manufacturing and distribution processes and all other general and administrative expenses outside the manufacturing and distribution functions (e.g., finance, human resources, information technology and corporate expenses). SG&A decreased $32.9 million, or 10%, to $295.7 million from $328.6 million in the prior-year period. Foreign currency translation reduced SG&A by $18.0 million, or 5%. The underlying decrease was driven by cost savings (primarily in marketing), lower professional fees and a one-time $2.3 million recovery of an indirect tax in Brazil.\nAs a percentage of sales, SG&A increased to 19.6% from 19.5% in the prior-year period primarily due to lower sales volume, partially offset by cost reductions.\nRestructuring (Credits) Charges\nThere were no new restructuring initiatives commenced in 2015; restructuring credits in the current year reflect adjustments to the initiatives commenced in 2014. Restructuring charges decreased $5.9 million from the prior-year period.\nOperating Income\nOperating income decreased $10.1 million, or 6%, to $163.5 million, from $173.6 million in the prior-year period. Foreign currency translation reduced operating income by $17.2 million, or 10%. The underlying increase was primarily due to lower restructuring charges.\nInterest Expense and Other Expense, Net\nInterest expense decreased $5.0 million, or 10%, to $44.5 million from $49.5 million in the prior-year period. The decrease was primarily due to lower debt outstanding compared to the prior year.\nOther expense, net increased by $1.3 million to $2.1 million from $0.8 million in the prior-year period. The increase was due to a $1.9 million write-off of debt issuance costs related to the second quarter of 2015 refinancing.\nIncome Taxes\nIncome tax expense was $45.5 million on income before taxes of $131.4 million, with an effective tax rate of 34.6%. For the prior-year period, income tax expense was $45.4 million on income before taxes of $137.0 million, with an effective tax rate of 33.1%. The effective tax rate for 2015 was higher than 2014 due to a greater percentage of U.S. income, which is taxed at a higher rate than income from most foreign jurisdictions.\nNet Income\nNet income decreased $5.7 million, or 6%, to $85.9 million, or\n$0.78\nper diluted share, from $91.6 million, or\n$0.79\nper diluted share in the prior-year period. Foreign currency translation reduced net income by $16.4 million, or 18%. The underlying increase was primarily due to lower restructuring charges and lower interest expense.\n32\nSegment Discussion\nYear Ended December 31, 2015\nAmount of Change\nNet Sales\nSegment Operating Income (1)\nOperating Income Margin\nNet Sales\nNet Sales\nSegment Operating Income\nSegment Operating Income\nMargin Points\n(in millions of dollars)\n$%\n$%\nACCO Brands North America\n$963.3\n$147.6\n15.3%\n$(42.7\n)\n(4)%\n$6.9\n5%\n130\nACCO Brands International\n426.9\n40.8\n9.6%\n(120.0\n)\n(22)%\n(22.1\n)\n(35\n)%\n(190\n)\nComputer Products Group\n120.2\n10.3\n8.6%\n(16.1\n)\n(12)%\n2.1\n26%\n260\nTotal\n$1,510.4\n$198.7\n$(178.8\n)\n$(13.1\n)\nYear Ended December 31, 2014\nNet Sales\nSegment Operating Income (A)\nOperating Income Margin\n(in millions of dollars)\nACCO Brands North America\n$1,006.0\n$140.7\n14.0%\nACCO Brands International\n546.9\n62.9\n11.5%\nComputer Products Group\n136.3\n8.2\n6.0%\nTotal\n$1,689.2\n$211.8\n(1) Segment operating income excludes corporate costs; \"\nInterest expense\n;\" \"\nInterest income\n;\" \"\nEquity in earnings of joint-venture\n\" and \"\nOther expense, net\n.\" See \"\nNote 16.

Foreign currency translation reduced sales by $18.3 million, or 2%. The underlying sales decline was primarily due to lower sales to Office Depot, where 2015 global sales declined $38 million, the vast majority of which impacted North America. The decline with Office Depot was largely related to its merger with OfficeMax, which has adversely impacted our sales primarily through lost placement and inventory reductions (including the effects of distribution center and store closures). We expect inventory reductions due to the merger to continue to adversely impact our sales in 2016, although to a lesser degree than in 2015. Partially offsetting the decline in the office superstore channel were increased sales in the e-commerce and mass-retailer channels.\nACCO Brands North America operating income increased $6.9 million, or 5%, to $147.6 million from $140.7 million in the prior-year period, and operating income margin increased to 15.3% from 14.0%. Foreign currency translation reduced operating income by $1.9 million, or 1%. The underlying improvement was due to a reduction in restructuring charges of $3.3 million as well as cost savings from prior-year restructuring initiatives, productivity improvements and lower pension expenses. The improvements were partially offset by lower sales volume.\nACCO Brands International\nACCO Brands International net sales decreased $120.0 million, or 22%, to $426.9 million from $546.9 million in the prior-year period. Foreign currency translation reduced sales by $94.3 million, or 17%, with all regions experiencing currency depreciation, but most notably Brazil, which accounted for $40.1 million of the reduction. The underlying sales decline was primarily driven by $21.6 million of lower sales volume in Brazil, which declined due to the adverse economic conditions. Sales in Europe also declined, primarily due to lost placement. These declines were partially offset by increased pricing of 7% as we sought to recover foreign-exchange-related increases in our cost of products sold.\nACCO Brands International operating income decreased $22.1 million, or 35%, to $40.8 million from $62.9 million in the prior-year period, and operating income margin decreased to 9.6% from 11.5%. Foreign currency translation reduced operating income by $12.4 million, or 20%. The underlying decline in operating income and margin was primarily due to Brazil where we have experienced both lower sales volume and an unfavorable product mix as customers traded down to lower-price-point items. The decline was partially offset by price increases and a one-time $2.3 million recovery of an indirect tax in Brazil.\n33\nComputer Products Group\nComputer Products Group net sales decreased $16.1 million, or 12%, to $120.2 million from $136.3 million in the prior-year period. Foreign currency translation reduced sales by $11.3 million, or 8%. The underlying sales decline was due to a $10 million reduction in our sales of tablet accessories, primarily resulting from our strategic decision to shift focus away from certain commoditized low margin products in this category. Sales of our security and laptop and desktop accessory products that collectively account for approximately 90% of our sales were up 5% compared to the prior year.\nComputer Products Group operating income increased $2.1 million, or 26%, to $10.3 million from $8.2 million in the prior-year period, and operating margin increased to 8.6% from 6.0%. Foreign currency translation reduced operating income by $2.9 million, or 35%. The underlying operating income and margin increased as the cost associated with moving our business away from commoditized low margin tablet accessories was significantly lower and improved operational execution on our security and laptop accessory products resulted in a favorable product mix.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nOur primary liquidity needs are to service indebtedness, fund capital expenditures and support working capital requirements. Our principal sources of liquidity are cash flows from operating activities, cash and cash equivalents held and seasonal borrowings under our revolving credit facilities in effect from time to time. As of\nDecember 31, 2016\n, there were\n$151.6 million\nborrowings under our\n$300.0 million\nrevolving credit facility and the amount available for borrowings was\n$140.6 million\n(allowing for\n$7.8 million\nof letters of credit outstanding on that date).\nSee \"\nNote 20. Subsequent Events\n\" to the consolidated financial statements contained in Item 8. of this report for details on the Company's refinancing associated with the Esselte Acquisition completed on\nJanuary 31, 2017.\nWe maintain adequate financing arrangements at market rates. Because of the seasonality of our business, we typically generate much of our cash flow in the first, third and fourth quarters, as accounts receivables are collected, and we use cash in the second quarter to fund working capital in order to support the North America back-to-school season. Our Brazilian business is highly seasonal due to the timing of the back-to-school season, which coincides with the calendar year-end in the fourth quarter. Due to various tax laws, it is costly to transfer short-term working capital in and out of Brazil; therefore, our normal practice is to hold seasonal cash requirements in Brazil, and invest in short-term Brazilian government securities. Consolidated cash and cash equivalents was\n$42.9 million\nas of\nDecember 31, 2016\n, approximately $14.0 million of which was held in Brazil. Our priorities for all other cash flow use over the near term, after funding internal growth, is debt reduction.\nOur senior secured credit facilities had a weighted average interest rate of\n2.85%\nas of\nDecember 31, 2016.\nDebt Amendments and Refinancing\nSenior Unsecured Notes\nOn December 22, 2016, the Company completed a private offering of $400.0 million in New Notes, which bear interest at 5.25%.\nIn addition, effective December 22, 2016, the Company irrevocably deposited with the trustee of its Existing Notes an amount necessary to pay the aggregate redemption price for the Existing Notes, and satisfied and discharged all its obligations related to the Existing Notes indenture. The Company borrowed\n$73.9 million\nunder its revolving credit facility and applied the funds, together with the net proceeds from the issuance of the New Notes and cash on hand, toward the payment of the redemption price for all of the Existing Notes. The aggregate redemption price of\n$531.5 million\nconsisted of principal due and payable on the Existing Notes, a \"make-whole\" call premium of\n$25.0 million\n(included in \"\nOther expense, net\n\"), and accrued and unpaid interest of\n$6.5 million\n(included in \"\nInterest expense\n\").\nAlso included in \"\nOther expense, net\n\" is a\n$4.9 million\ncharge for the write-off of debt issuance costs associated with the Existing Notes. Additionally, we incurred and capitalized approximately\n$6.1 million\nin bank, legal and other fees associated with the issuance of the New Notes.\n34\nSecond Amended and Restated Credit Agreement\nDuring 2016, the Company\u2019s credit facilities were governed by a Second Amended and Restated Credit Agreement, dated April 28, 2015 (as subsequently amended, the \"2015 Credit Agreement\"), among the Company, certain subsidiaries of the Company, Bank of America, N.A., as administrative agent, and the other agents and lenders party thereto. The\n2015 Credit Agreement\nprovided for a\n$600.0 million\nfive\n-year senior secured credit facility, which consisted of a\n$300.0 million\nrevolving credit facility (the \"2015 Revolving Facility\") and a\n$300.0 million\nterm loan.\nIn connection with the PA Acquisition, effective May 1, 2016, the Company entered into a Second Amendment and Additional Borrower Consent, among the Company, certain guarantor subsidiaries of the Company, Bank of America, N.A., as administrative agent, and the other lenders party thereto, which amended the 2015 Credit Agreement. Among other things, the Second Amendment amended the 2015 Credit Agreement to include ACCO Brands Australia Holding Pty. Ltd. (\"ACCO Australia\") as a foreign borrower and, together with a related incremental joinder agreement, facilitated borrowings under the 2015 Credit Agreement by ACCO Australia.\nOn May 2, 2016, the Company completed the PA Acquisition. The purchase price, net of cash acquired was\n$88.8 million\n. The PA Acquisition was financed through borrowings under the 2015 Credit Agreement consisting of\nA$100.0 million\n(US\n$76.6 million\nbased on May 2, 2016 exchange rates) in the form of an incremental Term A loan and additional borrowings of\nA$152.0 million\n(US\n$116.4 million\nbased on May 2, 2016 exchange rates) under the Company\u2019s revolving credit facility.\nLoan Covenants\nUnder the\n2015 Credit Agreement\n, the Company was required to meet certain financial tests, including a maximum Consolidated Leverage Ratio (as defined in the\n2015 Credit Agreement\n) as determined by reference to the following ratio.\nPeriod\nMaximum Consolidated Leverage Ratio\n(1)\nJuly 1, 2015 and thereafter\n3.75:1.00\n(1)\nThe Consolidated Leverage Ratio is computed by dividing the Company's net funded indebtedness by the cumulative four-quarter-trailing EBITDA, which excludes transaction costs, restructuring and other charges up to certain limits as well as other adjustments defined in the\n2015 Credit Agreement.\nThe Credit Agreement also required the Company to maintain a Consolidated Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio (as defined in the\n2015 Credit Agreement\n) as of the end of any fiscal quarter at or above\n1.25\nto 1.00.\nAs of December 31, 2016, our Consolidated Leverage Ratio was approximately 2.5 to 1 and our Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio (as defined in the\n2015 Credit Agreement\n) was approximately 5.5 to 1. As of and for the period ended December 31, 2016, we were in compliance with all applicable loan covenants.\nThird Amended and Restated Credit Agreement\nEffective January 27, 2017, the Company entered into a Third Amended and Restated Credit Agreement (the \"2017 Credit Agreement\"), dated as of January 27, 2017, among the Company, certain subsidiaries of the Company, Bank of America, N.A., as administrative agent, and the other agents and various lenders party thereto. The 2017 Credit Agreement amended and restated the Company\u2019s 2015 Credit Agreement.\nThe 2017 Credit Agreement provides a five-year senior secured credit facility, which consists of a\n\u20ac300 million\n(US\n$320.8 million\n) Euro denominated term loan facility (the \"Euro Term Loan A\"), an\nA$80 million\n(US\n$60.4 million\n) Australian Dollar denominated term loan facility (the \"AUD Term Loan A\"), and together with the Euro Term Loan A, the (\"Term A Loan Facility\"), and a\nUS$400 million\nmulti-currency revolving credit facility (the \"2017 Revolving Facility\"). At closing, additional borrowings under the 2017 Revolving Facility of\nUS$91.3 million\nwere applied toward, among other things, (i) the repayment of all outstanding U.S. Dollar denominated term loans under the 2015 Credit Agreement, (ii) the repayment of a portion of the Australian Dollar denominated term loans under the 2015 Credit Agreement, of which\nA$80 million\n(US\n$60.4 million\n) outstanding principal amount was continued under the AUD Term Loan A, and (iii) the payment of related financing fees and expenses. Immediately following the effective date of the 2017 Credit Agreement, approximately\nUS$156.7 million\nwas available for borrowing under the 2017 Revolving Facility.\n35\nMaturity and amortization\nBorrowings under the 2017 Revolving Facility and the Term A Loan Facility mature on January 27, 2022. Amounts under the 2017 Revolving Facility are non-amortizing. Beginning June 30, 2017, the outstanding principal amounts under the Term A Loan Facility will be payable in quarterly installments in an amount representing, on an annual basis, 5.0% of the initial aggregate principal amount of such loan facility and increasing to 12.5% on an annual basis by June 30, 2020.\nInterest rates\nAmounts outstanding under the\n2017 Credit Agreement\nwill bear interest at a rate per annum equal to the Eurodollar Rate, the Australian BBSR Rate, the Canadian BA Rate or the Base Rate, as applicable and as each such rate is defined in the 2017 Credit Agreement, plus an \u201capplicable rate.\u201d For the first fiscal quarter of 2017, the applicable rate will be 2.00% per annum for Eurodollar Rate Loans and Australian and Canadian denominated loans, and 1.00% per annum for Base Rate loans. Thereafter, the applicable rate applied to outstanding Eurodollar Rate loans, Australian and Canadian dollar denominated loans and Base Rate loans will be based on the Company\u2019s Consolidated Leverage Ratio (as defined in the\n2017 Credit Agreement\n) as follows.\nConsolidated\nLeverage Ratio\nApplicable Rate on Euro\/AUD\/CDN Dollar Loans\nApplicable Rate on Base Rate Loans\n> 4.00 to 1.00\n2.50%\n1.50%\n\u2264 4.00 to 1.00 and > 3.50 to 1.00\n2.25%\n1.25%\n\u2264 3.50 to 1.00 and > 3.00 to 1.00\n2.00%\n1.00%\n\u2264 3.00 to 1.00 and > 2.00 to 1.00\n1.50%\n0.50%\n\u2264 2.00 to 1.00\n1.25%\n0.25%\nUndrawn amounts under the 2017 Revolving Facility are subject to a commitment fee rate of 0.25% to 0.40% per annum, depending on the Company\u2019s Consolidated Leverage Ratio. At closing, the commitment fee rate was 0.35%.\nPrepayments\nSubject to certain conditions and specific exceptions, the\n2017 Credit Agreement\nrequires the Company to prepay outstanding amounts under the\n2017 Credit Agreement\nunder various circumstances, including (a) if sales or dispositions of certain property or assets in any fiscal year results in the receipt of net cash proceeds of $12.0 million, then an amount equal to 100% of the net cash proceeds received in excess of such $12.0 million, and (b) with respect to the AUD Term Loan A, in an amount equal to 100% of the net cash proceeds received from the disposition of any real property located in Australia. The Company also would be required to make prepayments in the event it receives amounts related to certain property insurance or condemnation awards, from additional debt other than debt permitted under the\n2017 Credit Agreement\nand from excess cash flow as determined under the\n2017 Credit Agreement\n. The\n2017 Credit Agreement\nalso contains other customary prepayment obligations and provides for voluntary commitment reductions and prepayment of loans, subject to certain conditions and exceptions.\nDividends and share repurchases\nUnder the\n2017 Credit Agreement\n, the Company may pay dividends and\/or repurchase shares in an aggregate amount not to exceed the sum of: (i) the greater of $30 million and 1.00% of the Company\u2019s Consolidated Total Assets (as defined in the\n2017 Credit Agreement\n); plus (ii) an additional amount not to exceed $75 million in any fiscal year (provided the Company\u2019s Consolidated Leverage Ratio after giving pro forma effect to the restricted payment would be greater than 2.50:1.00 and less than or equal to 3.75:1.00); plus (iii) an additional amount so long as the Consolidated Leverage Ratio after giving pro forma effect to the restricted payment would be less than or equal to 2.50:1.00; plus (iv) any Net Equity Proceeds (as defined in the\n2017 Credit Agreement\n).\nFinancial Covenants\nThe Company\u2019s Consolidated Leverage Ratio as of the end of any fiscal quarter may not exceed 3.75:1.00; provided that following the consummation of certain material acquisitions, and as of the end of the fiscal quarter in which such material acquisition occurred and as of the end of the three fiscal quarters thereafter, the maximum Consolidated Leverage Ratio level above will increase by 0.50:1.00, provided that no more than one such increase can be in effect at any time.\n36\nThe\n2017 Credit Agreement\nalso required the Company to maintain a Consolidated Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio (as defined in the\n2017 Credit Agreement\n) as of the end of any fiscal quarter at or above\n1.25\nto 1.00.\nOther Covenants and Restrictions\nThe\n2017 Credit Agreement\ncontains customary affirmative and negative covenants as well as events of default, including payment defaults, breach of representations and warranties, covenant defaults, cross-defaults, certain bankruptcy or insolvency events, certain ERISA-related events, changes in control or ownership and invalidity of any loan document. The\n2017 Credit Agreement\nalso establishes limitations on the aggregate amount of certain permitted acquisitions and investments that the Company and its subsidiaries may make during the term of the\n2017 Credit Agreement.\nGuarantees and Security\nGenerally, obligations under the\n2017 Credit Agreement\nare guaranteed by certain of the Company\u2019s existing and future subsidiaries, and are secured by substantially all of the Company\u2019s and certain guarantor subsidiaries\u2019 assets, subject to certain exclusions and limitations.\nIncremental facilities\nThe\n2017 Credit Agreement\npermits the Company to seek increases in the size of the 2017 Revolving Facility and the Term A Facility prior to maturity by up to $500.0 million in the aggregate, subject to lender commitment and the conditions set forth in the\n2017 Credit Agreement.\nCash Flow\nFiscal\n2016\nversus Fiscal\n2015\nCash Flow from Operating Activities\nFor the year ended\nDecember 31, 2016\n, cash provided by operating activities was\n$165.9 million\n, compared to cash provided by the prior-year operating activities of\n$171.2 million\n. Net income for\n2016\nwas\n$95.5 million\n, compared to\n$85.9 million\nin\n2015.\nThe net operating cash inflow for the 2016 year of\n$165.9 million\nwas generated by enhanced profitability across all operating segments, improved net working capital management (Accounts Receivable, Inventories, Accounts Payable) and incremental cash flow from the PA Acquisition. Cash outflows in 2016 included an accelerated interest payment of\n$6.5 million\n, in association with the early satisfaction and discharge of our $500 million principal amount of outstanding Senior Unsecured Notes due April 2020. Additionally,\n$11.6 million\nof cash payments were made related to transaction and integration costs associated with the Esselte Acquisition and the PA Acquisition. Accounts receivable contributed\n$13.4 million\nin 2016 due to improved management of year-end collections. Inventory provided cash of\n$16.7 million\nas a result of increased real-time inventory purchases earlier in the fourth quarter and improved forecasting, which also contributed to an increased use of cash for accounts payable, which was\n$19.3 million\nin 2016, compared to\n$2.6 million\nin the prior year. Partially offsetting the cash generated from operating profit and net working capital were significant cash payments related to the settlement of customer program liabilities, which were higher than the prior year due to changes in 2016 customer mix and increased settlements in early 2016 (related to higher year-end 2015 purchases by certain customers to achieve rebate levels). Outflows related to employee annual incentive payments made in the first quarter, underlying interest payments, income tax payments and restructuring cash payments were similar to those made during the prior year.\nThe table below shows our cash flow from accounts receivable, inventories and accounts payable for the years ended\nDecember 31, 2016\nand\n2015\n, respectively.\n(in millions of dollars)\n2016\n2015\nAccounts receivable\n$13.4\n$(3.9\n)\nInventories\n16.7\n9.8\nAccounts payable\n(19.3\n)\n(2.6\n)\nCash flow provided by net working capital\n$10.8\n$3.3\n37\nCash Flow from Investing Activities\nCash used by investing activities was\n$106.4 million\nand\n$24.6 million\nfor the\ntwelve\nmonths ended\nDecember 31, 2016\nand\n2015\n, respectively. The 2016 cash outflow reflects\n$88.8 million\nof purchase price net of cash acquired to finance the PA Acquisition. See \"\nNote 3. Acquisition\n\" to the condensed consolidated financial statements contained in Part II of this report for details on the PA Acquisition. Capital expenditures were\n$18.5 million\nand\n$27.6 million\nfor the\ntwelve\nmonths ended\nDecember 31, 2016\nand\n2015\n, respectively. The lower expenditure in the current-year reflects lower spend on information technology resulting from the implementation of a new enterprise resource planning (\"ERP\") system in our European operations in the first quarter of 2016.\nCash Flow from Financing Activities\nCash used by financing activities was\n$75.2 million\nfor the\ntwelve\nmonths ended\nDecember 31, 2016\n, compared to a use of\n$137.8 million\nfor the same period of\n2015\n. Cash used in 2016 reflected long-term borrowings of\n$587.4 million\n, consisting primarily of a private issuance of New Notes of\n$400.0 million\nand incremental Term A loan in the amount of\nA$100.0 million\n(\nUS$74.4 million\nbased on June 30, 2016 exchange rates), along with additional borrowings under the Company\u2019s existing revolving facility, to fund the PA Acquisition. Repayments of long-term debt of\n$685.1 million\nprimarily reflects the early satisfaction and discharge of our $500 million principal amount of Existing Notes, repayments totaling\n$148.0 million\non the U.S. Dollar Senior Secured Term Loan A and payment of $24.5 million of debt assumed with the PA Acquisition. In 2016, we also made a \"make-whole\" call premium payment of\n$25.0 million\nand paid\n$6.9 million\nin debt issuance fees in connection with the New Notes. Cash used in 2015 reflected net repayments of long-term debt of $70.1 million and $65.9 million to repurchase the Company's common stock and for payments related to tax withholding for share-based compensation.\nFiscal 2015 versus Fiscal 2014\nCash Flow from Operating Activities\nFor the year ended December 31, 2015, cash provided by operating activities was $171.2 million, compared to the cash provided by the prior-year period of $171.7 million. Net income for 2015 was $85.9 million, compared to $91.6 million in 2014.\nThe net cash inflow for the 2015 year of $171.2 million was primarily generated by operating profits, and was only slightly less than the prior year 2014 despite lower earnings in our international businesses. While severe economic conditions in Brazil put pressure on working capital efficiency, improved working capital management in the U.S. and Europe overcame this effect. The net cash inflow from working capital (accounts receivable, inventories and accounts payable) was $3.3 million. Of this, cash sourced from inventory of $9.8 million reflects improved supply chain management in the U.S. and Europe and reduced fourth quarter inventory purchases. Cash used by accounts payable of $2.6 million reflects the lower inventory purchases, partially offset by extended payment terms. Accounts receivable used $3.9 million, down $24.3 million from the prior year, due to timing of year-end collections and the adverse effect of foreign exchange. Cash settlements of customer rebate program liabilities, although significant, were lower than the prior year due to lower sales and the effects of foreign exchange. Other significant cash outflow reductions in 2015 helped offset the effects of lower earnings and reduced contribution from working capital, including: cash restructuring payments in 2015 which were $6.7 million and lower than the $16.9 million in the prior-year period (as we complete payments associated with restructuring actions taken in prior years), income tax payments of $16.9 million which were lower than the $28.9 million paid in 2014 due to certain one-off payments in the U.S., cash contributions to the Company's post-retirement plans that were $7.1 million in 2015, compared to $12.4 million in 2014 due to reduced U.S. funding requirements and interest payments that were reduced $4.1 million to $41.0 million in 2015 from $45.1 million in the prior year due to lower debt and the benefit of refinancing.\nThe table below shows our cash flow from accounts receivable, inventories and accounts payable for the years ended December 31,\n2015\nand\n2014\n, respectively.\n(in millions of dollars)\n2015\n2014\nAccounts receivable\n$(3.9\n)\n$20.4\nInventories\n9.8\n11.6\nAccounts payable\n(2.6\n)\n(10.1\n)\nCash flow provided by net working capital\n$3.3\n$21.9\n38\nCash Flow from Investing Activities\nCash used by investing activities was $24.6 million and $25.8 million for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively. Gross capital expenditures were $27.6 million and $29.6 million for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively, and continue to be information technology focused. Proceeds from the sale of properties and other assets were $2.8 million in 2015 primarily due to the sale of properties in the Czech Republic and Brazil, and $3.8 million in 2014 largely due to the sale of our East Texas, Pennsylvania facility.\nCash Flow from Financing Activities\nCash used by financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2015 and 2014 was $137.8 million and $142.0 million, respectively. Cash used in 2015 reflected net repayments of long-term debt of $70.1 million and $65.9 million to repurchase the Company's common stock and for payments related to tax withholding for share-based compensation. In 2014, net repayments of long-term debt were $121.1 million and $21.9 million was used to repurchase our Company's common stock and for payments related to tax withholding for share-based compensation.\nCapitalization\nThe Company had\n107.9 million\ncommon shares outstanding as of\nDecember 31, 2016.\nAdequacy of Liquidity Sources\nBased on our\n2017\nbusiness plan and current forecasts, we believe that cash flow from operations, our current cash balance and other sources of liquidity, including borrowings available under our 2017 Revolving Facility, will be adequate to support our requirements for working capital, capital expenditures and to service indebtedness for the foreseeable future. Our future operating performance is dependent on many factors, some of which are beyond our control, including prevailing economic, financial and industry conditions. For more information on these risks see \"Part I, Item1A.\nRisk Factors -\nOur significant indebtedness requires us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow to debt payments and limits our ability to engage in certain activities\n\"\nOff-Balance-Sheet Arrangements and Contractual Financial Obligations\nThe Company does not have any material off-balance-sheet arrangements that have, or are reasonably likely to have, a current or future effect on our financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources.\nOur contractual obligations and related payments by period at\nDecember 31, 2016\nwere as follows.\n(in millions of dollars)\n2017\n2018 - 2019\n2020 - 2021\nThereafter\nTotal\nDebt\n$5.1\n$14.4\n$284.0\n$400.0\n$703.5\nInterest on debt\n(1)\n29.9\n59.3\n44.6\n62.1\n195.9\nOperating lease obligations\n22.2\n35.1\n27.3\n15.8\n100.4\nPurchase obligations\n(2)\n84.8\n0.7\n\u2014\n\u2014\n85.5\nOther long-term liabilities\n(3)\n10.7\n2.0\n1.8\n4.4\n18.9\nTotal\n$152.7\n$111.5\n$357.7\n$482.3\n$1,104.2\n(1)\nInterest calculated at\nDecember 31, 2016\nrates for variable rate debt.\n(2)\nPurchase obligations primarily consist of contracts and non-cancelable purchase orders for raw materials and finished goods.\n(3)\nOther long-term liabilities consist of estimated expected employer contributions for 2017, along with estimated future payments, for pension and post-retirement plans that are not paid from assets held in a plan trust.\nDue to the uncertainty with respect to the timing of future cash flows associated with our unrecognized tax benefits at\nDecember 31, 2016\n, we are unable to make reasonably reliable estimates of the period of cash settlement with the respective taxing authorities. Therefore,\n$43.7 million\nof unrecognized tax benefits have been excluded from the contractual obligations table above. See \"\nNote 11. Income Taxes\n\" to the consolidated financial statements contained in Item 8. of this report for a discussion on income taxes.\nCritical Accounting Policies\n39\nOur financial statements are prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. (\"GAAP\"). Preparation of our financial statements requires us to make judgments, estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts of actual assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses presented for each reporting period. Actual results could differ significantly from those estimates. We regularly review our assumptions and estimates, which are based on historical experience and, where appropriate, current business trends. We believe that the following discussion addresses our critical accounting policies, which require more significant, subjective and complex judgments to be made by our management.\nRevenue Recognition\nWe recognize revenue from product sales when earned, net of applicable provisions for discounts, returns and allowances. We consider revenue to be realized or realizable and earned when all of the following criteria are met: title and risk of loss have passed to the customer, persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, delivery has occurred, the price is fixed or determinable and collectability is reasonably assured. We also provide for our estimate of potential bad debt at the time of revenue recognition.\nCustomer Program Costs\nCustomer programs and incentives are a common practice in our industry. We incur customer program costs to obtain favorable product placement, to promote sell-through of products and to maintain competitive pricing. Customer program costs and incentives, including rebates, promotional funds and volume allowances, are accounted for as a reduction to gross sales. These costs are recorded at the time of sale based on management\u2019s best estimates. Estimates are based on individual customer contracts and projected sales to the customer in comparison to any thresholds indicated by contract. In the absence of a signed contract, estimates are based on historical or projected experience for each program type or customer. Management periodically reviews accruals for these rebates and allowances, and adjusts accruals when circumstances indicate (typically as a result of a change in sales volume expectations or customer contracts).\nAllowances for Doubtful Accounts and Sales Returns\nTrade receivables are recorded at the stated amount, less allowances for discounts, doubtful accounts and returns. The allowance for doubtful accounts represents estimated uncollectible receivables associated with potential customer defaults on contractual obligations, usually due to customers\u2019 potential insolvency. The allowance includes amounts for certain customers where a risk of default has been specifically identified. In addition, the allowance includes a provision for customer defaults on a general formula basis when it is determined the risk of some default is probable and estimable, but cannot yet be associated with specific customers. The assessment of the likelihood of customer defaults is based on various factors, including the length of time the receivables are past due, historical experience and existing economic conditions.\nThe allowance for sales returns represents estimated uncollectible receivables associated with the potential return of products previously sold to customers, and is recorded at the time that the sales are recognized. The allowance includes a general provision for product returns based on historical trends. In addition, the allowance includes a reserve for currently authorized customer returns that are considered to be abnormal in comparison to the historical basis.\nInventories\nInventories are priced at the lower of cost (principally first-in, first-out with minor amounts at average) or market. A reserve is established to adjust the cost of inventory to its net realizable value. Inventory reserves are recorded for obsolete or slow-moving inventory based on assumptions about future demand and marketability of products, the impact of new product introductions and specific identification of items, such as product discontinuance or engineering\/material changes. These estimates could vary significantly, either favorably or unfavorably, from actual requirements if future economic conditions, customer inventory levels or competitive conditions differ from our expectations.\nLong-Lived Assets\nWe test long-lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the assets\u2019 carrying amount may not be recoverable from its undiscounted cash flow. When such events occur, we compare the sum of the undiscounted cash flow expected to result from the use and eventual disposition of the asset or asset group to the carrying amount of a long-lived asset or asset group. The cash flows are based on our best estimate at the time of future cash flow, derived from the most recent business projections. If this comparison indicates that there is an impairment, the amount of the impairment is typically calculated using discounted expected future cash flow. The discount rate applied to these cash flows is based on our weighted average cost of capital, computed by selecting market rates at the valuation dates for debt and equity that are reflective of the risks associated with an investment in our industry as estimated by using comparable publicly traded companies.\n40\nIntangible Assets\nIntangible assets are comprised primarily of indefinite-lived and amortizable intangible assets acquired and arising from the application of purchase accounting. Indefinite-lived intangible assets are not amortized, but are evaluated at least annually to determine whether the indefinite useful life is appropriate. In addition, amortizable intangible assets other than goodwill are amortized over their useful lives. Certain of our trade names have been assigned an indefinite life as we currently anticipate that these trade names will contribute cash flows to ACCO Brands indefinitely.\nWe review indefinite-lived intangibles for impairment at least annually, normally in the second quarter, and whenever market or business events indicate there may be a potential adverse impact on a particular intangible. The review may be on a qualitative or quantitative basis as allowed by GAAP. We consider the implications of both external factors (e.g., market growth, pricing, competition, and technology) and internal factors (e.g., product costs, margins, support expenses, and capital investment) and their potential impact on cash flows for each business in both the near and long term, as well as their impact on any identifiable intangible asset associated with the business. Based on recent business results, consideration of significant external and internal factors, and the resulting business projections, indefinite-lived intangible assets are reviewed to determine whether they are likely to remain indefinite-lived, or whether a finite life is more appropriate. In addition, based on events in the period and future expectations, management considers whether the potential for impairment exists.\nFinite lived intangibles are amortized over 10, 15, 23 or 30 years.\nWe performed our annual assessment, on a qualitative basis, as allowed by GAAP, for the majority of indefinite-lived trade names in the second quarter of\n2016\nand concluded that no impairment existed. For two of our indefinite-lived trade names that are not substantially above their carrying values, Mead\n\u00ae\nand Hilroy\n\u00ae\n, we performed quantitative tests (Step 1) in the second quarter of 2016. The following long-term growth rates and discount rates were used,\n1.5%\nand\n10.0%\nfor Mead\n\u00ae\n, and\n1.5%\nand\n10.5%\nfor Hilroy\n\u00ae\n, respectively.\nWe concluded that neither Mead\n\u00ae\nnor Hilroy\n\u00ae\nwere impaired.\nIn the fourth quarter of 2015, we performed a quantitative test, as we identified the recession in Brazil as a triggering event related to our trade name, Tilibra\n\u00ae\nprimarily used in Brazil. While we concluded that no impairment existed, the trade name's fair value has been significantly reduced. Key financial assumptions utilized to determine the fair value of Tilibra\n\u00ae\nincluded a long-term growth rate of 6.5% and a 14.5% discount rate. In 2016, the Tilibra\n\u00ae\ntrade name slightly outperformed the forecast used in the fourth quarter of 2015 quantitative test; however, the economic conditions in Brazil could deteriorate further triggering additional future reviews.\nThe fair values of Mead\n\u00ae\n, Tilibra\n\u00ae\nand Hilroy\n\u00ae\ntrade names are less than 30% above their carrying values. As of\nDecember 31, 2016\nthe carrying values of those trade names were as follows: Mead\n\u00ae\n(\n$113.3 million\n), Tilibra\n\u00ae\n(\n$63.0 million\n) and Hilroy\n\u00ae\n(\n$11.8 million\n).\nGoodwill\nGoodwill has been recorded on our balance sheet and represents the excess of the cost of an acquisition when compared to the fair value of the net assets acquired. The authoritative guidance on goodwill and other intangible assets requires that goodwill be tested for impairment at a reporting unit level. We have determined that our reporting units are the ACCO Brands North America, ACCO Brands International and Computer Products Group segments.\nWe test goodwill for impairment at least annually and whenever events or circumstances make it more likely than not that an impairment may have occurred. As permitted by GAAP, we may perform a qualitative assessment to determine if it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount as a basis for determining whether it is necessary to perform the two-step goodwill impairment test included in GAAP. Entities are not required to calculate the fair value of a reporting unit unless they determine that it is more likely than not that the fair value is less than the carrying amount. We performed our annual assessment in the second quarter of\n2016\n,\non a qualitative basis, and concluded that it was not more likely than not that the fair value of any reporting unit is less than its carrying amount.\nIf the qualitative assessment determines that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, or if it is determined that a qualitative assessment is not appropriate, we move onto the two-step goodwill impairment test where we calculate the fair value of the reporting units. When applying a fair-value-based test the fair value of a reporting unit is compared to its carrying value. If the fair value of a reporting unit exceeds the carrying value of the net assets assigned to a reporting unit, goodwill is considered not impaired and no further testing is required. If the carrying value of the net assets assigned to a reporting unit exceeds the fair value of a\nreporting unit, the second step of the impairment test is performed in order to determine the implied fair value of a reporting unit\u2019s goodwill. Determining the implied fair value of goodwill requires\n41\nvaluation of a reporting unit\u2019s tangible and intangible assets and liabilities in a manner similar to the allocation of purchase price in a business combination. If the carrying value of a reporting unit\u2019s goodwill exceeds its implied fair value, goodwill is deemed impaired and is written down to the extent of the difference.\nGiven the current economic environment and the uncertainties regarding their impact on our business, there can be no assurance that our estimates and assumptions made for purposes of our qualitative impairment testing during\n2016\nwill prove to be accurate predictions of the future. If our assumptions regarding forecasted revenue or margin growth rates of certain reporting units are not achieved, we may be required to record impairment charges in future periods, whether in connection with our next annual impairment testing in the second quarter of fiscal year\n2017\nor prior to that, if a triggering event is identified outside of the quarter when the annual impairment test is performed. It is not possible at this time to determine if any such future impairment charge would result or, if it does, whether such charge would be material.\nEmployee Benefit Plans\nWe provide a range of benefits to our employees and retired employees, including pension, post-retirement, post-employment and health care benefits. We record annual amounts relating to these plans based on calculations specified by GAAP, which include various actuarial assumptions, including discount rates, assumed rates of return, compensation increases, turnover rates and health care cost trend rates. Actuarial assumptions are reviewed on an annual basis and modifications to these assumptions are made based on current rates and trends when it is deemed appropriate. As required by GAAP, the effect of our modifications are generally recorded and amortized over future periods.\nWe believe that the assumptions utilized in recording our obligations under the plans are reasonable based on our experience. The actuarial assumptions used to record our plan obligations could differ materially from actual results due to changing economic and market conditions, higher or lower withdrawal rates or other factors which may impact the amount of retirement-related benefit expense recorded by us in future periods.\nThe discount rate assumptions used to determine the pension and post-retirement obligations of the benefit plans are based on a spot-rate yield curve that matches projected future benefit payments with the appropriate interest rate applicable to the timing of the projected future benefit payments. The assumed discount rates reflect market rates for high-quality corporate bonds currently available. Our discount rates were determined by considering the average of pension yield curves constructed of a large population of high quality corporate bonds. The resulting discount rates reflect the matching of plan liability cash flows to the yield curves.\nThe expected long-term rate of return on plan assets reflects management\u2019s expectations of long-term average rates of return on funds invested based on our investment profile to provide for benefits included in the projected benefit obligations. The expected return is based on the outlook for inflation, fixed income returns and equity returns, while also considering historical returns over the last 10 years, and asset allocation and investment strategy.\nWe estimate the service and interest components of net periodic benefit cost (income) for pension and post-retirement benefits utilizing a full yield curve approach in the estimation of these components by applying the specific spot rates along the yield curve used in the determination of the benefit obligation to the relevant projected cash flows.\nAt the end of each calendar year an actuarial evaluation is performed to determine the funded status of our pension and post-retirement obligations and any actuarial gain or loss is recognized in other comprehensive income (loss) and then amortized into the income statement in future periods.\nPension income was\n$5.3 million\n,\n$5.1 million\nand\n$0.2 million\nfor the years ended\nDecember 31, 2016\n,\n2015\nand\n2014\n, respectively. The\n$4.9 million\nincrease in pension income in\n2015\ncompared to\n2014\nwas primarily due to the change in the amortization of our net actuarial loss included in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) for the U.S. Salaried Plan from the average remaining service period of active employees expected to receive benefits under the plan to the average remaining life expectancy of all participants (this change was the result of the Company's decision to permanently freeze the benefits under the plan) and lower interest costs due to lower average interest rates and the weakening of currencies relative to the U.S. dollar. Post-retirement income was\n$0.7 million\n,\n$0.7 million\nand\n$0.5 million\nfor the years ended\nDecember 31, 2016\n,\n2015\nand\n2014\n, respectively.\n42\nThe weighted average assumptions used to determine benefit obligations for the years ended\nDecember 31, 2016\n,\n2015\n, and\n2014\nwere as follows.\nPension\nPost-retirement\nU.S.\nInternational\n2016\n2015\n2014\n2016\n2015\n2014\n2016\n2015\n2014\nDiscount rate\n4.3%\n4.6%\n4.2%\n2.7%\n3.7%\n3.4%\n3.4%\n3.9%\n3.7%\nRate of compensation increase\nN\/A\nN\/A\nN\/A\n3.1%\n3.0%\n3.3%\nN\/A\nN\/A\nN\/A\nThe weighted average assumptions used to determine net periodic benefit cost for the years ended December 31,\n2016\n,\n2015\nand\n2014\nwere as follows.\nPension\nPost-retirement\nU.S.\nInternational\n2016\n2015\n2014\n2016\n2015\n2014\n2016\n2015\n2014\nDiscount rate\n4.6%\n4.2%\n5.0%\n3.7%\n3.4%\n4.3%\n3.9%\n3.7%\n4.4%\nExpected long-term rate of return\n7.8%\n8.0%\n8.2%\n6.0%\n6.5%\n6.8%\nN\/A\nN\/A\nN\/A\nRate of compensation increase\nN\/A\nN\/A\nN\/A\n3.0%\n3.0%\n3.3%\nN\/A\nN\/A\nN\/A\nIn\n2017\n, we expect pension income of approximately\n$6.5 million\nand post-retirement income of approximately\n$0.2 million\n. The estimated\n$1.2 million\nincrease in pension income for\n2017\ncompared to\n2016\nis primarily due to lower discount rates, which have reduced interest costs and have been partially offset by a reduction in the expected return on plan assets, primarily due to lowered expectations for our international pension plans.\nA 25-basis point change (0.25%) in our discount rate assumption would lead to an increase or decrease in our pension and post-retirement expense of approximately\n$0.03 million\nfor\n2017\n. A 25-basis point change (0.25%) in our long-term rate of return assumption would lead to an increase or decrease in pension and post-retirement expense of approximately\n$1.2 million\nfor\n2017.\nPension and post-retirement liabilities of\n$98.0 million\nas of December 31,\n2016\n, increased from\n$89.1 million\nat December 31,\n2015\n,\nprimarily due to lower discount rates compared to prior year assumptions for the U.K. plan.\nIncome Taxes\nDeferred tax liabilities or assets are established for temporary differences between financial and tax reporting bases and are subsequently adjusted to reflect changes in tax rates expected to be in effect when the temporary differences reverse. A valuation allowance is recorded to reduce deferred tax assets to an amount that is more likely than not to be realized. Facts and circumstances may change and cause us to revise the conclusions on our ability to realize certain net operating losses and other deferred tax attributes.\nThe amount of income taxes that we pay is subject to ongoing audits by federal, state and foreign tax authorities. Our estimate of the potential outcome of any uncertain tax position is subject to management\u2019s assessment of relevant risks, facts and circumstances existing at that time. We believe that we have adequately provided for reasonably foreseeable outcomes related to these matters. However, our future results may include favorable or unfavorable adjustments to our estimated tax liabilities in the period the assessments are revised or resolved.\nDeferred income taxes are not provided on certain undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries that are expected to be permanently reinvested in those companies, aggregating approximately\n$555 million\nand\n$540 million\nas of\nDecember 31, 2016\nand\n2015\n, respectively. If these amounts were distributed to the U.S., in the form of a dividend or otherwise, we would be subject to additional U.S. income taxes. Determination of the amount of unrecognized deferred income tax liabilities on these earnings is not practicable.\nRecent Accounting Standards Updates and Recently Adopted Accounting Standards\nFor information on recent accounting pronouncements see \"\nNote 2. Significant Accounting Policies\n\" to the consolidated financial statements contained in Item 8. of this report.\n43","2":"ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATION\nThe\nfollowing discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read together with our financial\nstatements and the related notes and the other financial information included elsewhere in this report. This discussion contains\nforward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. Our actual results could differ materially from those anticipated\nin these forward-looking statements as a result of various factors, including those discussed below and elsewhere in this report,\nparticularly those under \"Risk Factors.\" Dollars in tabular format are presented in thousands, except per share data,\nor otherwise indicated.\nOVERVIEW\nGrowGeneration\u2019s\nmission is to become one of the largest retail hydroponic and organic specialty gardening retail outlets in the industry. Today,\nGrowGeneration owns and operates a chain of twelve (12) retail hydroponic\/gardening stores, with ten (10) located in the state\nof Colorado, one (1) in the state of California and one (1) in the state of Nevada. Our plan is to open and operate hydroponic\/gardening\nstores throughout the United States.\nOur\nstores sell thousands of products, such as organic nutrients and soils, advanced lighting technology, state of the art hydroponic\nand aquaponic equipment, and other products needed to grow indoors and outdoors. Our strategy is to target two distinct verticals;\nnamely (i) commercial growers, and (ii) smaller growers who require a local store to fulfill their daily and weekly growing needs.\nGrowGeneration\nserves a new, yet sophisticated community of commercial and urban cultivators growing specialty crops including organics, greens\nand plant-based medicines. Unlike the traditional agricultural industry, these cultivators use innovative indoor and outdoor growing\ntechniques to produce specialty crops in highly controlled environments. This enables them to produce crops at higher yields without\nhaving to compromise quality, regardless of the season or weather and drought conditions.\nOur\ntarget market segments include the commercial growers in the cannabis market (Dispensaries, Cultivators, Caregivers), the home\ncannabis grower and to businesses and individuals who grow organically grown herbs and leafy green vegetables.\nSales\nat our GrowGeneration stores have grown since we organized the business. Our growth has been fueled by frequent and higher dollar\ntransactions from commercial growers, individual home growers and gardeners who grow their own organic foods. We expect to continue\nto experience significant growth over the next few years, primarily from existing and new stores that we open or acquire. Our\ngrowth is likely to come from four distinct channels: establishing new stores in high-value markets, internal growths at existing\nstores, acquiring existing stores with strong customer bases and strong operating histories and the creation of a business to\nbusiness e-commerce portal at www.GrowGeneration.com.\nOn\nFebruary 15, 2015, we opened our first non-acquired GrowGeneration store in Trinidad, Colorado. This store is 3,000 square feet\nand was initially stocked with $100,000 in inventory. Our lease obligation for this store was $1,000 per month for 3 years.\nIn\nApril 2015, we acquired approximately $30,000 of inventory at cost from Green Growers, Inc., a retail store located in Canon City,\nColorado. In connection therewith, we engaged the CEO of Green Growers, Inc. as a sales consultant for a period of two years.\nWe pay this individual a base fee of $1,200 per month during the first year and $600 per month during the second year of his consulting\nagreement, together with incentive compensation for any new business he generates, in an amount equal to 25% of the gross profit\non all such business. We also issued this consultant 10,000 three (3) year options, exercisable at a price of $.60 per share,\nas additional compensation under his consulting agreement.\nIn\nJune 2015, we acquired approximately $68,000 of inventory at cost from Happy Grow Lucky, Inc., a retail store located in Conifer,\nColorado. In connection therewith, we engaged the 2 principals as sales consultants for a period of one year. We will pay each\nsales consultant $420 per month, together with incentive compensation for any new business they generate, in an amount equal to\n25% of the gross profit of such business. In addition, we executed a new 3 year lease for the premises in Conifer, Colorado. at\na rate of $2,400 per month.\n16\nOn\nSeptember 1, 2015, we signed a 5 year lease, at a rate of $3,780 to open our Colorado Springs, Colorado store.\nOn\nOctober 28, 2015, we purchase approximately $169,000 of inventory, at cost, from Sweet Leaf Hydroponics Inc., a retail store located\nin Santa Rosa, California. In connection therewith, we also acquired some equipment from the seller for $25,000. We have entered\ninto a one-year agreement with one of the principals to act as a sales consultant for us for a period of one year, at a cost of\n$1,000 per month. We executed a two year lease with the landlord of Sweet Leaf Hydroponics Inc. for $5,300 per month through December\n2017. We also issued this consultant 25,000 three (3) year options, exercisable at a price of $.60 per share, as additional compensation\nunder his consulting agreement.\nOn\nNovember 28, 2015, the Company acquired $35,000 of inventory of Greenhouse Tech Inc., a retail store located in Colorado. The\nCompany engaged the principal of Greenhouse Tech as a sales consultant for 1 year, at $13 per hour and 20% of the gross profits\non all sales generated by sales consultant.\nOn\nMarch 1, 2016, we signed a 3 year lease, at a rate of $3,650 for the first year, 4,498 square feet, located in Denver, Colorado.\nOn\nJuly 15, 2016, the Company entered into a new lease agreement for its Canon City, Colorado location. The Canon City Store completed\nits move to its new location on July 25, 2016. The new store is approximately 4,427 square feet.\nOn\nJuly 19, 2016 the Company entered into a 2 year lease agreement for its tenth retail store in Fairplay, Colorado. The store began\noperations in Fairplay, Colorado on August 1, 2016. In December 2016, the Company consolidated all the operations and business\nof the store in Fairplay, Colorado into the store in Conifer, Colorado. Effective as of December 31, 2016, the lease agreement\nfor the retail store in Fairplay, Colorado was terminated.\nOn\nSeptember 27, 2016, the Company entered into a commercial lease to rent certain premises located in Castle Rock, Colorado, to\nbe effective from October 1, 2016 to September 30, 2019. The lease requires monthly payments of $1,775 through September 30, 2017;\n$1,980 through September 30, 2018 and $2,138 through September 30, 2019. This eleventh store of the Company began operations on\nOctober 1, 2016.\nOn October 6, 2016, the Company closed\non the 2106 private placement, pursuant to which it sold 1,000,000 units to 8 accredited investors at a price of $.70 per unit,\nwith each unit consisting of one share of common stock and one warrant to purchase one share of common stock at an exercise price\nof $.70 per share. The warrants have a five year life for gross proceeds of $700,000.\nEffective\nas of October 19, 2016, the Company has been approved to start trading its common stock on the OTCQB Marketplace under the ticker\nsymbol of \u201cGRWG\u201d.\nThe\nlease of the Company store in Las Vegas, Nevada commenced on November 15, 2016 and continues through February 28, 2022 and requires\nmonthly payments of $6,776 through February 28, 2018, with annual increases of 4% for the balance of the term of the lease.\nOn\nJanuary 30, 2017, the Company entered into a commercial lease to rent certain premises located in Trinidad, Colorado, to be effective\nfrom March 1, 2017 to February 28, 2022. This 7,383 square feet premises is used by the Company to open a new store to replace\nand consolidate its existing 3,000 square feet store in Trinidad as part of the Company\u2019s expansion plan.\nOn\nFebruary 1, 2017, the Company entered into a commercial lease to rent certain 12,837 square feet premises located in Denver, Colorado,\nto be effective from February 1, 2017 to February 1, 2022. The premises is used by the Company to open a new store and as the\nCompany\u2019s principal offices.\n17\nOn\nFebruary 1, 2017, the Company\u2019s wholly-owned subsidiary, GrowGeneration California Corp. (\u201cGrowGeneration California\u201d)\nentered into an asset purchase agreement (\u201cAsset Purchase Agreement\u201d) with an individual to purchase certain assets\nfrom the seller in connection with a retail hydroponic and garden supply business located in Santa Rosa, CA. The assets subject\nto the sale under the Asset Purchase Agreement included inventories, fixed assets, tangible personal property, intangible personal\nproperty, receivables and a custom list. In addition to the cash consideration for the purchase of such assets, GrowGeneration\nCalifornia also agreed to make certain cash payments and 25,000 shares of common stock of the Company to the seller contingent\non the achievement of revenue goals by the business in 2017, 2018 and 2019. The closing of the asset purchase took place on February\n8, 2017.\nIn connection with the purchase of the\nassets, GrowGeneration California also entered into a commercial lease, effective from March 1, 2017 to February 28, 2022, to rent\nthe premises where the former business was located. In connection therewith, we closed our existing store in Santa Rosa and consolidated\nthose operations with the GrowGeneration California operations opened at the new location.\nOn\nMarch 10, 2017, the Company closed a private placement of a total of 825,000 units of the Company\u2019s securities to 4 accredited\ninvestors. Each unit consists of (i) one share of the Company\u2019s common stock and (ii) one 5 year warrant to purchase one\nshare of common stock at an exercise price of $2.75 per share. The Company raised an aggregate of $1,650,000 gross proceeds in\nthe offering.\nRESULTS\nOF OPERATIONS\nThe\nfollowing table sets forth information from our statements of operations for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015.\nFor the Year Ended\nDecember 31\nYear to Year Comparison\n2016\n2015\nIncrease\/ (decrease)\nPercentage Change\nSales\n$7,980,471\n$3,455,146\n4,525,325\n131%\nCost of Sales\n5,776,194\n2,351,836\n3,424,358\n146%\nGross profit (loss)\n2,204,277\n1,103,310\n1,100,967\n100%\nGeneral and administrative expenses\n2,630,070\n1,617,930\n1,012,320\n63%\nTotal operating expenses\n2,630,070\n1,617,930\n1,012,320\n63%\nLoss from operations\n(425,993\n)\n(514,620\n)\n(88,627\n)\n(17%)\nNet loss\n(431,244\n)\n(528,756\n)\n(97,512\n)\n(18%)\nRevenue\nNet\nrevenue for the year ended December 31, 2016 increased $4,525,325 to $7,980,471, as compared to $3,455,146 for the year ended\nDecember 31, 2015. The increase was due to revenue from the retail stores that we acquired and opened during that period and the\ngrowth from our existing stores.\nCost\nof Goods Sold\nCost\nof sales for the year ended December 31, 2016 increased by $3,424,358 to $5,776,194, as compared to $2,351,836 for the year ended\nDecember 31, 2015. The increase was due to an increase in the company\u2019s revenue.\nGross\nprofit was $2,204,277 for the year ended December 31, 2016, as compared to $1,103,310 for the year ended December 31, 2015. The\nincrease of $1,100,967 was due to an increase in the company\u2019s revenue.\n18\nGeneral\nand Administrative Expenses\nGeneral and administrative expenses\nfor the year ended December 31, 2016 increased by $1,012,340 to $2,630,270, as compared to $1,617,930 for the year ended December\n31, 2015. The increase was mainly due to increased payroll expenses, rent expense, professional fees, broker commissions, travel\nexpense and non-cash expenses.\nNon-cash general and administrative\nexpenses for the year ended December 31, 2016 increased by $47,946 to $304,123, as compared to $256,177 for the year ended December\n31, 2015. The increase was mainly due to increase in bad debt, depreciation expense and an increase in stock and stock option expense\ntotaling $304,123, with (i) depreciation of $52,962, (ii) stock and stock option compensation, broker commissions of $184,333,\nand (iii) bad debt expense of $66,828.\nNet\nIncome\nNet\nloss for the year ended December 31, 2016 decreased by $97,512 to $(431,246), as compared to $(528,750) for the year ended December\n31, 2015. The decrease was mainly due to an increase in sales and less non-cash expenses.\nFor the year ended December 31,\n2015, the Company had a total of 5 stores, opened more than a year, that generated net revenue of $2,917,188, as compared to net\nrevenue of $4,355,786, for the Company's 5 same stores in the year of 2016.\nFor the fourth quarter of 2016, the\nCompany had 6 same stores which generated net revenue of $1,476,963, as compared to the same stores in 2015 which generated net\nrevenue of $1,020,348.\nIn 2015, the Company opened 3 new stores\nthat generated net revenue of $514,429. These same 3 stores generated net revenue of $2,427,542 in 2016.\nIn\n2016, the Company opened 2 new stores that generated net revenue of $1,197,143.\n5 Same Stores Open for a Year\n5 New Stores\nYear Ended 2015\nYear Ended 2016\n$ Variance\nYear Ended 2016\nNet revenue\n$2,197,188\n$4,355,786\n$1,438,598\n$3,624,685\nOperating\nActivities\nNet\ncash used in operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2016 increased by $335,268 to $1,470,907, as compared to $1,135,639\nfor the year ended December 31, 2015. The increase was mainly due to an increase in inventory, accounts receivables and accounts\npayable.\nLiquidity\nand Capital Resources\nAs\nof the date of this report, the Company had cash of approximately $1,200,000. As of the year ended December 31, 2016, the Company\nhad net working capital of approximately $2,764,655, which consists of $606,644 in cash, $391,235 in accounts receivables and\n$2,574,438 in inventory.\nWe\nwill need to obtain additional financing in the future to continue to acquire and open new stores. We have financed our operations\nthrough the issuance of the sale of common stock and warrant exercises.\nThe\nfollowing table sets forth a summary of our approximate cash flows for the periods indicated.\nYear Ended\nDecember 31,\n2016\nYear Ended\nDecember 31,\n2015\nNet cash (used in) operating activities\n$(1,470,907\n)\n$(1,135,639\n)\nNet cash used in investing activities\n$(331,580\n)\n$(253,717\n)\nNet cash provided by financing activities\n$1,709,714\n$1,978,214\nNet cash used in operating activities\nwas $1,470,907 for the year ended December 31, 2016, compared to $1,135,639 provided by operating activities for 2015. The\nincrease in cash used in operating activities in the year ended December 31, 2016 was primarily caused by an increase in inventory\nof $1,256,799 and the increase of accounts receivables of $395,208 for operating activities.\n19\nNet\ncash used in investing activities was $331,580 for the year ended December 31, 2016, compared to $253,717 provided by operating\nactivities for the year ended December 31, 2015. The increase in net cash used in investing activities for the year ended\nDecember 31, 2016 was primarily due to the purchasing of capital assets.\nNet cash provided by financing activities\namounted to $1,709,714 for the year ended December 31, 2016, as compared to $1,978,214 provided by financing activities for the\nyear ended December 31, 2015. The decrease of $268,500 net cash provided by financing activities in fiscal year 2016 is primarily\ndue to the decrease of common stock issuances.\nOFF-BALANCE\nSHEET ARRANGEMENTS\nWe\ndo not have any off-balance sheet arrangements (as that term is defined in Item 303 of Regulation S-K) that are reasonably likely\nto have a current or future material effect on our financial condition, revenue or expenses, results of operations, liquidity,\ncapital expenditures or capital resources.\nRECENTLY\nISSUED ACCOUNTING STANDARDS\nIn May 2016, accounting guidance was issued to clarify\nthe not yet effective revenue recognition guidance issued in May 2014. This additional guidance does not change the core principle\nof the revenue recognition guidance issued in May 2014, rather, it provides clarification of accounting for collections of sales\ntaxes as well as recognition of revenue (i) associated with contract modifications, (ii) for noncash consideration, and (iii) based\non the collectability of the consideration from the customer. The guidance also specifies when a contract should be considered\n\u201ccompleted\u201d for purposes of applying the transition guidance. The effective date and transition requirements for this\nguidance are the same as the effective date and transition requirements for the guidance previously issued in 2014, which is effective\nfor interim and annual periods beginning on or after December 15, 2017. The Company has not yet determined the impact that this\nnew guidance will have on its consolidated financial statements.\nIn March 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-09, Compensation\n\u2013 Stock Compensation (Topic 718): Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting. The amendments in this update\nchange existing guidance related to accounting for employee share-based payments affecting the income tax consequences of awards,\nclassification of awards as equity or liabilities, and classification on the statement of cash flows. ASU 2016-09 is effective\nfor annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2016, including interim periods within those annual periods, with early\nadoption permitted. The Company is currently evaluating the potential impact of the adoption of this standard.\nIn February 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-02, Leases\n(Topic 842). The new standard establishes a right-of-use (\u201cROU\u201d) model that requires a lessee to record a ROU asset\nand a lease liability on the consolidated balance sheet for all leases with terms longer than 12 months. Leases will be classified\nas either finance or operating, with classification affecting the pattern of expense recognition in the consolidated income statement.\nASU 2016-02 is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2018, including interim periods within those annual periods,\nwith early adoption permitted. A modified retrospective transition approach is required for lessees for capital and operating leases\nexisting at, or entered into after, the beginning of the earliest comparative period presented in the financial statements, with\ncertain practical expedients available. The Company is currently evaluating the potential impact of the adoption of this standard.\nIn January 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-01, Recognition\nand Measurement of Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities. The amendments in this update revise the accounting related to the\nclassification and measurement of investments in equity securities and the presentation of certain fair value changes for financial\nliabilities measured at fair value. The amendments are effective for annual reporting periods after December 15, 2017, including\ninterim periods within those fiscal years. Early adoption is permitted. The Company is currently evaluating the potential impact\nof the adoption of this standard.\nIn April 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-03, Interest-\nImputation of Interest (Subtopic 835-30). This guidance is to simplify the presentation of debt issuance costs by recognizing a\ndebt liability in the balance sheet as a direct deduction from that debt liability consistent with the presentation of a debt discount.\nThe amendments in this update are effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2015,\nand interim periods within those fiscal years. The Company has adopted this standard and the adoption did not have a material impact\non the Company\u2019s financial position.\nIn August 2014, the FASB issued ASU 2014-15, Presentation\nof Financial Statements \u2013 Going Concern (Subtopic 205-40): Disclosure of Uncertainties about an Entity\u2019s Ability to\nContinue as a Going Concern, which is intended to define management\u2019s responsibility to evaluate whether there is substantial\ndoubt about an organization\u2019s ability to continue as a going concern within one year after the date that the financial statements\nare issued (or within one year after the date that the financial statements are available to be issued when applicable) and to\nprovide related footnote disclosures. The ASU provides guidance to an organization\u2019s management, with principles and definitions\nthat are intended to reduce diversity in the timing and content of disclosures that are commonly provided by organizations today\nin the financial statement footnotes. The ASU is effective for annual periods ending after December 15, 2016, and interim periods\nwithin annual periods beginning after December 15, 2016, which for the Company is April 1, 2017. Early adoption is permitted. The\nadoption of this standard will not have a material impact on the Company\u2019s financial position or results of operations. The\namendments also clarify that the guidance in Topic 275, Risks and Uncertainties, is applicable to entities that have not commenced\nplanned principal operations. The central feature of the guidance on disclosure requirements is that required disclosures are limited\nto matters significant to a particular entity. The disclosures focus primarily on risks and uncertainties that could significantly\naffect the amounts reported in the financial statements in the near term or the near-term functioning of the reporting entity.\nOther Accounting standards that have been issued or\nproposed by FASB that do not require adoption until a future date are not expected to have a material impact on the consolidated\nfinancial statements upon adoption. The Company does not discuss recent pronouncements that are not anticipated to have an impact\non or are unrelated to its financial condition, results of operations, cash flows or disclosures.","3":"ITEM 7.  MANAGEMENT\u2019S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nThis section of the report includes a number of forward-looking statements that reflect our current views with respect to future events and financial performance. Forward-looking statements are often identified by words like: believe, expect, estimate, anticipate, intend, project and similar expressions, or words which, by their nature, refer to future events. You should not place undue certainty on these forward-looking statements, which apply only as of the date of this annual report. These forward-looking statements are subject to certain risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from historical results or our predictions.\nOverview\nThe following discussion is an overview of the important factors that management focuses on in evaluating our businesses, financial condition and operating performance and should be read in conjunction with the financial statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.  This discussion contains forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties.  Actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in these forward looking statements as a result of any number of factors, including those set forth in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, and elsewhere in our other public filings. Factors that may cause actual results, our performance or achievements, or industry results to differ materially from those contemplated by such forward-looking statements include without limitation.\n1.\nThe company\u2019s lack of funds in new R&D, especially in clinical testing;\n2.\nThe company\u2019s lack of funds in new equipment and the utilization of the production process after CFDA approval;\n3.\nThe company may need to seek funding through such vehicles as convertible notes and warrants, private placements, and\/or convertible debentures;\n4.\nThe company needs funding for marketing and network build-up;\n5.\nThe company plans to seek approval for clinical testing and marketing on a worldwide basis, including US FDA approval for testing and marketing in the United States of America, and there is no guaranty that we will obtain any such approval;\n6.\nWhile the company currently holds a patent originating in China, the patent does not protect our intellectual property in the United States, and the company is unsure of the validity of the patent in other countries. However, specific trade secrets are involved in the manufacturing of our product to help protect our technologies, and reverse engineering is unlikely for our types of products and technologies. New patents are expected to be filed as result of our continuous research works for new and refined materials. Additionally, all machinery used to manufacture our products is protected by Chinese patents.\nThe Company is subject to a number of risks similar to other companies in the medical device industry. These risks include rapid technological change, uncertainty of market acceptance of our products, uncertainty of regulatory approval, competition from substitute products from larger companies, the need to obtain additional financing, compliance with government regulations, protection of proprietary technology, product liability, and the dependence on key individuals.\nAll written and oral forward-looking statements made in connection with this Form 10-K that are attributable to us or persons acting on our behalf are expressly qualified in their entirety by these cautionary statements.  Given the uncertainties that surround such statements, you are cautioned not to place undue reliance on such forward-looking statements.\n14\nOur Business\nWe are engaged in the business of designing, developing, manufacturing and the planned future marketing of self-reinforced, re-absorbable biodegradable internal fixation devices. Our polyamide materials are protected by Patent no. ZL971190739, PRC, issued by the State Intellectual Property Office of the P.R.C., is used in producing screws, binding wires, rods and related products. These products are used in a variety of applications, which include orthopedic trauma, sports related medical treatment, or cartilage injuries, and reconstructive dental procedures. Our products are biodegradable internal fixation devices which are made of a very unique material called Polyamide (\u201cPA\u201d). Our PA products, such as screws, rods, and binding wires consist of enhanced fibers and high molecular polymers, which are designed to facilitate quick healing of complex fractures in many areas of the human skeletal system. Our products offer a number of significant advantages over existing metal implants and the first generation of degradable implants (i.e. PLLA) for patients, surgeons and other customers including.\n1.\nA notably reduced need for a secondary surgery to remove implant due to post-operative complications, therefore avoiding unnecessary risk and expense on all patient care;\n2.\nEnhancing the performance of the materials by manufacturing them to be easily fitted to each patient, forming an exact fit;\n3.\nImproving the biological activity of materials. Clinical trial results have shown that as PA implants degrade, they promote a progressive shift of load to the new bone creating micro-motion and thereby avoiding bone atrophy due to \u2019stress shielding\u2019;\n4.\nReducing the chance of post-operative infection;\n5.\nEffectively controlling the degeneration speed, so that there will be no complications in treating repeat injuries;\n6.\nEase of post-operative care i.e. no distortion during x-ray imaging;\n7.\nSimple and cost-effective to manufacture.\nOur products are designed to replace the traditional internal fixation device made of stainless steel and titanium and overcome the limitations of previous generations of products such as PLA and PLLA. Our laboratory statistics show that our PA products have a higher mechanical strength, last longer in degradation ratio and are more evenly absorbed form outer layer inwards as compared with similar materials such as PLA and PLLA. Thus PA allows increased restoration time for bone healing and re-growth. The Company\u2019s PA Degradable and Absorbable Screw (\u201cPA Screw\u201d) and Degradable and Absorbable Binding Wire (\u201cPA Binding Wire) are currently being tested in human trials under permit from the China Food and Drug Administration (\u201cCFDA\u201d). As of October 31, 2016, the Company completed 83 successful PA Screw trial cases, and 57 successful PA Binding Wire. Upon the completion of these trials the Company has already exceeded China CFDA\u2019s requirement on PA Screw trial. The Company\u2019s CFDA Application for its PA Screw is in the CFDA Review Process.\nCFDA Application Process for PA Screws\nThe Company first submitted its application for PA Screws to the CFDA, formally SFDA, in 2008. The application has been withheld by the CFDA pending additional clinical trial cases. This is due to the amended CFDA regulations, which unlike previous regulations require the applicant to specify the position on the body where the clinical trial is carried out. Our amended CFDA application has specified the ankle fracture as the body part of our clinical trial. This is because bones around this part carry most of the body weight. As of October 31, 2011, we have completed all additional clinical trials required by the CFDA with 100 percent success rate. As of October 31, 2016, the company\u2019s CFDA Application is under the CFDA Review Process.\nIn March 2013, The State Food and Drug Administration of the PRC (\u201cSFDA\u201d), China\u2019s medical device market regulatory agency, underwent a reorganization that saw much of China\u2019s food and drug regulatory powers consolidated into the agency, elevating it back to a ministerial-level agency directly under the State Council. The new name for the agency is China State Food and Drug Administration (\u201cCFDA\u201d). The name change meant the CFDA reports directly to China\u2019s State Council and has broader authority to oversee medical device as well as food and drug sectors. This reorganization leads to a more streamlined and efficient registration process for medical devices in China. Since the reorganization, the CFDA has issued series of circulars and guidelines to help applicants. Following the CFDA guidelines, the Company has improved its GMP facilities, updated its Technical Documentation System to cover key areas such as Clinical Trial, Manufacturing Process, R&D, Monitoring and Quality Control. Due to the uniqueness of our material, there are no established CFDA Product Standards that we can follow during our application process for our PA Screws. To establish our own Product Standards, the Company has been carrying out extra tests. The Company has submitted its Product Standards and supplementary reports to the CFDA in 2014. In December 2016, the Company received a notice from the CFDA requesting supplementary report as part of current review process. The Company is preparing for the supplementary report and intend to submit it to the CFDA by the end of 2nd quarter of 2017\nThe Company\u2019s production lines are fully operational. We have been producing products for further researches, testing and product quality control improvements. Following the CFDA final approval, the company will be earning revenues in the same quarter that its application is approved. However, we are not able to anticipate the timeline of the CFDA Review Process.\nClinical Trials on Other Products\nCurrently, we have been conducting clinical trials for PA Binding Wires at the 6 state level hospitals authorized by the CFDA in cities throughout China, including Nanchang, Changsha, Luoyang, Nanning and Tianjin. We have successfully completed all 60 clinical human trial cases required by the CFDA, and we have completed 42 comparison cases. CFDA regulations require each successful clinical trial case to be accompanied by a trial case that uses a different product for comparison reasons. We intended to start CFDA Application Process for our PA Binding Wires when we complete the remaining 18 comparison cases.\n15\nThe Company has setup a joint research project with Sichuan University. The Company has completed the design and production of testing mini-screws using its patented PA material. This project is currently under way.\nHowever, there can be no assurance that the company will be able to obtain any further clearances or approvals, if required, to market its products for their intended uses on a timely basis, if at all. Moreover, regulatory approvals, if granted, may include significant limitations on the indicated uses for which a product may be marketed. Delays in the receipt of or the failure to obtain such clearances or approvals, the need for additional clearances or approvals, the loss of previously received clearances or approvals, unfavorable limitations or conditions of approval, or the failure to comply with existing or future regulatory requirements could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business, financial condition and results of operations.\nGovernment Regulation\nMedical implant devices\/products manufactured or marketed by the company in China are subject to extensive regulations by the CFDA. Pursuant to the related laws and acts, as amended, and the regulations promulgated there under (the \u201cCFDA Regulations\u201d), the CFDA regulates the clinical testing, manufacture, labeling, distribution and promotion of medical devices. The CFDA also has the authority to request repair, replacement, or refund of the cost of any device manufactured or distributed by the Company.\nUnder the CFDA Regulations, medical devices are classified into three classes (class I, II or III), the basis of the controls deemed necessary by the CFDA to reasonably assure their safety and efficacy. Under the CFDA\u2019s regulations, class I devices are subject to general controls [for example, labeling and adherence to Good Manufacturing Practices (\u201cGMP\u201d) requirements] and class II devices are subject to general and special controls. Generally, class III devices are those, which must receive premarket approval by the CFDA to ensure their safety and efficacy (for example, life-sustaining, life-supporting and certain implantable devices, or new devices which have not been found substantially equivalent to legally marketed class I or class II devices). The Company is classified as a manufacturer of class III medical devices. Current CFDA enforcement policy prohibits the marketing of approved medical devices for unapproved uses.\nBefore a new device can be introduced into the market in China, the manufacturer generally must obtain CFDA marketing clearance through clinical trials. Since the company is classified as a manufacturer of Class III medical devices, the company must carry out all clinical trials in pre-selected CFDA approved hospitals.\nManufacturers of medical devices for marketing in China are required to adhere to GMP requirements. Enforcement of GMP requirements has increased significantly in the last several years and the CFDA has publicly stated that compliance will be more strictly scrutinized. From time to time the CFDA has made changes to the GMP and other requirements that increase the cost of compliance. Changes in existing laws or requirements or adoption of new laws or requirements could have a material adverse effect on the company\u2019s business, financial condition and results of operations. There can be no assurance that the company will not incur significant costs to comply with applicable laws and requirements in the future or that applicable laws and requirements will not have a material adverse effect upon the company\u2019s business, financial condition and results of operations.\nRegulations regarding the development, manufacturing and sale of the company\u2019s products are subject to change. The company cannot predict the impact, if any, that such changes might have on its business, financial condition and results of operations.\nResults of Operations\nThe \u201cResults of Operations\u201d discussed in this section merely reflect the information and results of Masterise and Shenzhen Changhua for the years ended October 31, 2016 and 2015.\nRevenues\nThe Company is in its development stage and does not have any revenue. The management team is continuously looking for fundraising possibilities for product improvement, machinery upgrades, facility expansions, continuous research and development, and sales and marketing preparation.\nOur facility is located in Shenzhen, China, which is built to meet the GMP standards. Our facility covers about 865 square meters, which includes the combined facilities of offices, laboratories, and workshops. There is one production line for the PA Screw and another production line for the PA Binding Wire. The annual production capabilities of each production line are 100,000 pieces for PA Screw, and 240,000 packs for the PA Binding Wires. Both production lines, at their maximum production capacities are capable of generating approximately $30,000,000 in annual revenue.\n16\nEstimate current production lines in full capacity\nOutput Quantity (Max.)\nPrice at ex-factory (US$)\nTotal Turnover (US$)\nPA Screw\n100,000\n(piece)\n180\n18,000,000\nPA Binding Wire\n240,000\n(pack)\n50\n12,000,000\nTotal.\n30,000,000\nThe Company will market its products through a hybrid sales force comprised of a managed network of independent regional distributors\/sales agents (80%) and direct sales representatives (20%) in China.\nThere are two ways the company will generate revenue, 1) through our nationwide and regional distributors and 2) through our direct sales channels.\nFunding Needs\nThe Company estimates that it will need to raise minimum $750,000 over the next 12 months to bring its current products to market, and begin earning revenues.  This amount may increase if we decide to start clinical trials on new products. Once we receive the CFDA permit for our PA Screw, our revenue will cover our expenditures. Otherwise, we will continue to rely on external investments and shareholder\u2019s loans to meet our cash needs. While the Company has no outside sources of funding, the Company\u2019s shareholders have committed to advance the Company funds as needed.  There is a Letter of Continuing Financial Support signed between the Company and one of its major shareholders, Titan Technology Development Ltd.\nChina\u2019s Marketing Analysis and Sales Strategy\nWe have established long term relationships with many hospitals and national distributors in China. Ms. Hui Wang, the Company\u2019s CEO, has over 20 years\u2019 sales experience in medical distribution. She will be in charge of our sales programs. Professor LIU, Shangli, our chief medical advisor for Greater China, is one of the highest ranked orthopedic doctors in China as well as being highly renowned in the rest of the world. He will assist the Company in nationwide product promotion and joint projects with associated academic institutions and medical schools.\nDuring product development and clinical trial stages we developed close relationships with many major national hospitals. We expect these relationships to boost our revenue generation following CFDA final approval. In order to better serve our customers, including hospitals, distributors, patients and the general public, the Company will set up Regional Service Offices to provide technical support, product information, and customer aid service.\nChina\u2019s market for PA devices depends on 3 major conditions.\n- Patients\n- Advanced technology level\n- Performance and price of the materials\nThe demand for internal fixation medical devices has rapidly increased during the last decade. According to China Health Care Year Book 2013, the total revenue of Chinese orthopaedic hospitals in 2013 was US$1.28 billion with over 11.5 million patients. From 2009 to 2013, the market size of China\u2019s orthopaedic devices has grown from US$1.1 billion to US$1.92 billion, and it is estimated to reach US$4 billion in 2020. China has overtaken Japan as the second largest market in the world. The market size for trauma treatment implant devices such as our PA Screw and PA Wire was US$626.3 million or 32.6% of the total market value in 2013, and it is estimated to grow to US$1.164 billion in 2019. New and improved medical technology will continue to rapidly grow throughout hospitals in China, and material optimization and product pricing is expected to directly stimulate increased sales.\nThe Company has advantages and more opportunities over others competitors due to.\n- No other similar patent registrations in China.\n- We are the only company qualified and permitted to perform PA clinical trials by the CFDA\n- We have a timing advantage over other companies in China, which would have to go through the preclinical testing for the CFDA permit on clinical trials.\n- Under new regulations by the CFDA, it will take at least 5-10 years for clinical trials.\n- Our patented material will enables us to rapidly diversify our product line according to market trend and demand.\n17\nNumber of Hospitals in China in year 2016 Statistic and Census report by the National Health and Family Planning Commission of the People\u2019s Republic of China.\nStatistic and Census report by National Health and Family Planning Commission of the People\u2019s Republic of China\n(October 2016)\nOctober 2016\nOctober 2015\nIncrease \/ (Decrease)\nTotal No. of Hospitals\n28,584\n26,997\n1,587\nPublic Hospital\n12,786\n13,237\n(451\n)\nPrivate Hospital\n15,798\n13,760\n2,038\nHospital Rating\nAAA\n2,194\n2,044\n150\nAA\n7,807\n7,101\n706\nA\n9,090\n7,512\n1,578\nIn general, technological advancements and the marketing potential within Asia are the biggest factors in driving significant growth within the global orthopedic devices market. Another major factor that positively influences this market is the growing number of aging baby boomers with active lifestyles. This sector represents a large portion of the total population.\nResearch and Development\nResearch and development costs related to both present and future products are expensed as incurred. Total expenditure on research and development charged to general and administrative expenses for the years ended October 31, 2016 and 2015 was $57,300 and $60,262.\nWe expect research and development expenses to grow as we continue to invest in basic research, clinical trials, product development and in our intellectual property.\nPre-Market Research\nThe Company has been conducting Pre-Market Research while its PA Screw Application is under CFDA review. The research is intended to estimate the potential market success of the company\u2019s products that can be expected. The research also looks beyond the Company\u2019s initial market - China, and covers international markets. Based on the results of our Pre-Market Research and the positive feedbacks, we have received from trade shows and industrial conferences, it is the Company\u2019s intention to apply for additional international regulatory approvals in due course.\nFinance Costs\nAs of October 31, 2016 and 2015, the Company owed $546,953 and $562,187 respectively to a stockholder \u2013 Titan Technology Development Limited, which is unsecured and repayable on demand. Interest is charged at 7% per annum on the amount owed.\nAs of October 31, 2016 and 2015, the Company owed $130,914 and $27,229 respectively to a third party - Shenzhen Hygeian Medical Device Co., Ltd., which is unsecured and repayable on demand. Interest is charged at 7% per annum on the amount owed.\nAs of October 31, 2016 and 2015, the Company owed $1,578,843 and $1,807,103 to Chi Fung Yu, $1,471,898 and $1,660,763 to Tie Jun Chen, $32,972 and $33,133 to Que Feng (related parties), which are unsecured and repayable on demand. Interest is charged at 7% per annum on the amount owed.\nTotal interest expenses on advances from a stockholder accrued for the year ended October 31, 2016 and October 31, 2015 are $33,665 and $31,615 for Titan Technology Development Limited.\nTotal interest expenses on advances from following company accrued for the year ended October 31, 2016 and October 31, 2015 are $5,289 and $114 for Shenzhen Hygeian Medical Device Co., Ltd.\nTotal interest expenses on advances from following related parties accrued for the year ended October 31, 2016 and October 31, 2015 are $96,828 and $99,978 for Chi Fung Yu; $92,369 and $87,089 for Tie Jun Chen; $2,133 and $1,495 for Que Feng.\nAs of October 31, 2016 and October 31, 2015, the Company owed the following amounts respectively to two directors for advances made - $341,626 and $417,966 to Hui Wang, $22,193 and $21,897 to Chi Ming Yu. These advances were made on an unsecured basis, repayable on demand and interest free.\n18\nImputed interest on the amounts owed to two directors for the year ended October 31, 2016 and 2015 respectively is $18,990 and $21,164 for Hui Wang; $0 and $0 for Chi Ming Yu.\nIncome Tax\nABMT was incorporated in the United States and has incurred net operating loss for income tax purposes for 2016 and 2015. ABMT has net operating loss carry forwards for income taxes amounting to approximately $1,771,223 and $1,612,970 as of October 31, 2016 and 2015 respectively which may be available to reduce future years\u2019 taxable income. These carry forwards, will expire, if not utilized, commencing in 2029. Management believes that the realization of the benefits from these losses appears uncertain due to the Company\u2019s limited operating history and continuing losses. Accordingly, a full, deferred tax asset valuation allowance has been provided and no deferred tax asset valuation allowance has been provided and no deferred tax asset benefit has been recorded. The valuation allowance at October 31, 2016 and 2015 was $602,216 and $548,410 respectively. The net change in the valuation allowance for 2016 was an increase of $53,806.\nMasterise was incorporated in the BVI and under current law of the BVI, is not subject to tax on income.\nShenzhen Changhua was incorporated in the PRC and is subject to PRC income tax which is computed according to the relevant laws and regulations in the PRC. The income tax rate has been 25%. No income tax expense has been provided by Shenzhen Changhua as it is waiting for CFDA approval and it has incurred losses.\nNet Loss\nAs reflected in the accompanying audited consolidated financial statements, the Company has an accumulated deficit of $6,987,698 at October 31, 2016 that includes a net loss of $724,737 for the year ended October 31, 2016. We are in Clinical Trial phase and do not have a CFDA permit to produce, market or sell in China.\nWe therefore do not have any revenue from inception to October 31, 2016 but have to incur operating expenses for the upkeep of the Company and the clinical trials.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nWe had a working capital deficit of $4,435,981 at October 31, 2016 compared to a working capital deficit of $4,568,106 as of October 31, 2015. Our working capital deficit increased as a result of the fact that we are in clinical trial phase, the company has put all resources to complete the clinical trials. We do not have a CFDA permit to produce, market or sell in China. We had no revenues during the year and that our sole source of financing came in the form of a loan from our related parties and stockholders.\nCash Flows\nNet Cash Used in Operating Activities\nNet cash used in operating activities was $371,653 in the year ended October 31, 2016. This amount was attributable primarily to the net loss after adjustment for non-cash items, such as depreciation and imputed interest on advances from directors.\nNet Cash Used in Investing Activities\nWe recorded $2,956 net cash used in investing activities in the year ended October 31, 2016. This amount reflected purchases of property and equipment, primarily for research and development to our facilities.\nNet Cash Provided by Financing Activities\nNet cash provided by financing activities in the year ended October 31, 2016 was $343,826, which represented advances from related parties.\nOperating Capital and Capital Expenditure Requirements\nOur ability to continue as a going concern and support the commercialization of current products is dependent upon our ability to obtain additional financing in the near term. We anticipate that such funding will be in the form of equity financing from sales of our common stock. However, there is no assurance that we will be able to raise sufficient funding from the sale of our common stock to fund our business plan should we decide to proceed. We anticipate continuing to rely on advances from our related parties and stockholders in order to continue to fund our business operations\nWe believe that our existing cash, cash equivalents at October 31, 2016, will be insufficient to meet our cash needs. The management is actively pursuing additional funding and strategic partners, which will enable the Company to implement our business plan, business strategy, to continue research and development, clinical trials or further development that may arise.\n19\nDebt Conversion\nOn November 13, 2015, the Company entered into a debt conversion agreement with Titan Technology Development Ltd. (\"TTD\"), pursuant to which the Company and Titan agreed to convert $500,000 of the accrued interest of the outstanding debt owed by the Company to Titan into shares of the Company\u2019s Common Stock at a conversion price of $0.05 per share. Pursuant to the terms of the Debt Conversion Agreement, on November 13, 2015, $500,000 of the accrued interest of TTD\u2019s outstanding loan was converted into 10,000,000 shares of Company Common Stock.\nGoing Concern\nAs reflected in the accompanying consolidated financial statements, the Company has an accumulated deficit of $6,987,698 as of October 31, 2016 that includes a net loss of $724,737 for the year ended October 31, 2016.  The Company\u2019s total current liabilities exceed its total current assets by $4,435,981 and the Company used cash in operations of $371,653.\nThese factors raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. In view of the matters described above, recoverability of a major portion of the recorded asset amounts shown in the accompanying balance sheet is dependent upon continued operations of the Company, which in turn is dependent up the Company\u2019s ability to raise additional capital, obtain financing and succeed in its future operations. The financial statements do not include any adjustments relating to the recoverability and classification of recorded asset amounts or amounts and classification of liabilities that might be necessary should the Company be unable to continue as a going concern.\nManagement has taken steps to revise its operating and financial requirements, which it believes are sufficient to provide the Company with the ability to continue as a going concern. The Company is now pursuing additional funding and potential merger or acquisition candidates, which would enhance stockholders\u2019 investment. Management believes that the above actions will allow the Company to continue operations through the next fiscal year.\nAs of October 31, 2016, loans from the Company\u2019s stockholder, two directors, three related parties and a non-related third party totaling $4,125,345 were provided to us for use as working capital. Management believes that such financing will allow us to continue operations through the next fiscal year. The Company is also actively pursuing a number of private placements funding which would ensure continued operations.\nOFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS\nWe do not have any off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources that are material to our investors.\nCRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES\nThe preparation of our financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. On an ongoing basis, we evaluate our estimates, including but not limited to those related to income taxes and impairment of long-lived assets. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions and factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Based on our ongoing review, we plan to adjust to our judgments and estimates where facts and circumstances dictate. Actual results could differ from our estimates.\nWe believe the following critical accounting policies are important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results and require our management\u2019s most difficult, subjective or complex judgments, often because of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain.\n1.\nProperty and equipment\nProperty and equipment are stated at cost, less accumulated depreciation.  Expenditures for additions, major renewals and betterments are capitalized and expenditures for maintenance and repairs are charged to expense as incurred.\nDepreciation is provided on a straight-line basis, less estimated residual value over the assets estimated useful lives.  The estimated useful lives of the assets are 5 years.\n2.\nLong-lived assets\nIn accordance with FASB Codification Topic 360 (ASC Topic 360), \u201cAccounting for the impairment or disposal of Long-Lived Assets\u201d, long-lived assets and certain identifiable intangible assets held and used by the Company are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. For purposes of evaluating the recoverability of long-lived assets, the recoverability test is performed using undiscounted net cash flows related to the long-lived assets. The Company reviews long-lived assets to determine that carrying values are not impaired.\n20\nLong-lived assets, such as property, plant and equipment are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the book value of the asset may not be recoverable. Impairment of the carrying value of long-lived assets would be indicated if the best estimate of future undiscounted cash flows expected to be generated by the asset grouping is less than its carrying value. If an impairment is indicated, any loss is measured as the difference between estimated fair value and carrying value and is recognized in operating income. For the year ended October 31, 2016 and 2015, the company has not recognized any impairment charges.\n3.\nFair value of financial instruments\nFASB Codification Topic 825 (ASC Topic 825), \u201cDisclosure About Fair Value of Financial Instruments,\u201d requires certain disclosures regarding the fair value of financial instruments. The carrying amounts of other receivables and prepaid expenses, other payables and accrued expenses, due to a stockholder, directors and related parties approximate their fair values because of the short-term nature of the instruments. The management of the Company is of the opinion that the Company is not exposed to significant interest or credit risks arising from these financial statements.\n4.\nGovernment grant\nGovernment grants are recognized when there is reasonable assurance that the Company complies with any conditions attached to them and the grants will be received.\n5.\nIncome taxes\nThe Company accounts for income taxes under the FASB Codification Topic 740-10-25 (\u201cASC 740-10-25\u201d). Under ASC 740-10-25, deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases.  Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled.  Under ASC 740-10-25, the effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized as income in the period included the enactment date.\n6.\nResearch and Development\nResearch and development costs related to both present and future products are expensed as incurred.\n7.\nForeign currency translation\nThe financial statements of the Company\u2019s subsidiary denominated in currencies other than US $ are translated into US $ using the closing rate method.  The balance sheet items are translated into US $ using the exchange rates at the respective balance sheet dates.  The capital and various reserves are translated at historical exchange rates prevailing at the time of the transactions while income and expenses items are translated at the average exchange rate for the year.  All exchange differences are recorded within equity.\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\nIn August 2014, FASB issued Accounting Standards Update (ASU) No. 2014-15 Preparation of Financial Statements \u2013 Going Concern (Subtopic 205-40), Disclosure of Uncertainties about an Entity\u2019s Ability to Continue as a Going Concern. Under generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP), continuation of a reporting entity as a going concern is presumed as the basis for preparing financial statements unless and until the entity\u2019s liquidation becomes imminent. Preparation of financial statements under this presumption is commonly referred to as the going concern basis of accounting. If and when an entity\u2019s liquidation becomes imminent, financial statements should be prepared under the liquidation basis of accounting in accordance with Subtopic 205-30, Presentation of Financial Statements\u2014Liquidation Basis of Accounting. Even when an entity\u2019s liquidation is not imminent, there may be conditions or events that raise substantial doubt about the entity\u2019s ability to continue as a going concern. In those situations, financial statements should continue to be prepared under the going concern basis of accounting, but the amendments in this Update should be followed to determine whether to disclose information about the relevant conditions and events. The amendments in this Accounting Standards Update are effective for the annual period ending after December 15, 2016, and for annual periods and interim periods thereafter. Early application is permitted. The Company will evaluate the going concern considerations in this ASU, however, at the current period, management does not believe that it has met conditions which would subject these financial statements for additional disclosure.\nThe Company has reviewed all recently issued, but not yet effective, accounting pronouncements and do not believe the future adoptions of any such pronouncements may be expected to cause a material impact on the financial condition or the results of operations.\n21","4":"ITEM 7.\nMANAGEMENT\u2019S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.\nManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (\u201cMD&A\u201d) is intended to inform the reader about matters affecting the financial condition and results of operations of Primerica, Inc. (the \u201cParent Company\u201d) and its subsidiaries (collectively, \u201cwe,\u201d \u201cus\u201d or the \u201cCompany\u201d) for the three-year period ended December 31, 2016. As a result, the following discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes that are included herein. This discussion contains forward-looking statements that constitute our plans, estimates and beliefs. These forward-looking statements\n37\ninvolve numerous risks and uncertainties, including, but not limited to, those discussed in \u201cRisk Factors\u201d. Actual results may differ materially from those contained in any\nforward-looking statements.\nThis MD&A is divided into the following sections.\n\u2022\nBusiness Trends and Conditions\n\u2022\nFactors Affecting Our Results\n\u2022\nCritical Accounting Estimates\n\u2022\nResults of Operations\n\u2022\nFinancial Condition\n\u2022\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nBusiness Trends and Conditions\nThe relative strength and stability of financial markets and economies in the United States and Canada affect our growth and profitability. Our business is, and we expect will continue to be, influenced by a number of industry-wide and product-specific trends and conditions. Economic conditions, including unemployment levels and consumer confidence, influence investment and spending decisions by middle-income consumers, who are generally our primary clients. These conditions and factors also impact prospective recruits\u2019 perceptions of the business opportunity that becoming a Primerica sales representative offers, which can drive or dampen recruiting. Consumer spending and borrowing levels affect how consumers evaluate their savings and debt management plans. In addition, interest rates and equity market returns impact consumer demand for the savings and investment products we distribute. Our customers\u2019 perception of the strength of the capital markets will influence their decisions to invest in the investment and savings products we distribute. The financial and distribution results of our operations in Canada, as reported in U.S. dollars, are affected by changes in the currency exchange rate. The Canadian dollar exchange rate increased modestly in 2016 when compared with 2015 while it decreased sharply in 2015 when compared with 2014. Therefore, the Canadian dollar exchange rate had less impact on the results of our business in 2016 compared to 2015 for all amounts translated and reported in U.S. dollars. The effects of these trends and conditions are discussed below and in the Results of Operations section.\nSize of our Independent Sales Force.\nOur ability to increase the size of our independent sales force is largely based on the success of our sales force\u2019s recruiting efforts as well as training and motivating recruits to get licensed to sell life insurance. We believe that recruitment and licensing levels are important to sales force trends, and growth in recruiting and licensing is usually indicative of future growth in the overall size of the sales force. Recruiting changes do not always result in commensurate changes in the size of our licensed sales force because new recruits may obtain the requisite licenses at rates above or below historical levels.\nRegulatory changes can also impact the size of our independent sales force. For example, the insurance regulators in Canada implemented a new life insurance licensing examination program in January 2016 that requires applicants to complete increased examination requirements in order to obtain a life insurance sales license and has the potential to decrease the number of applicants who obtain their life insurance licenses in Canada. However, we have undertaken efforts to adapt our licensing process to the new program in order to mitigate any adverse effect that these increased examination requirements could have on the size of our Canadian life-licensed sales force. We have not observed a meaningful decline in the number of new life-licensed agents in Canada since the program became effective at the beginning of 2016.\nNew recruits increased in 2016 to 262,732 from 228,115 in 2015 and 190,439 in 2014 primarily due to growth in the size of our sales force, resulting in more agents available to actively recruit, and is complemented by positive momentum in our business. The size of our life-licensed sales force increased to 116,827 sales representatives at December 31, 2016 from 106,710 at December 31, 2015 and 98,358 at December 31, 2014, primarily due to the increase in recruiting in recent periods, as well as our strong focus on training of new sales representatives to become licensed to sell life insurance.\nTerm Life Insurance Product Sales and Face Amount In Force.\nThe average number of life-licensed sales representatives and the number of term life insurance policies issued, as well as the average monthly rate of new policies issued per life-licensed sales representative (historically between 0.18 and 0.22), were as follows.\nYear ended December 31,\n2016\n2015\n2014\nAverage number of life-licensed sales representatives\n111,843\n101,660\n96,780\nNumber of new policies issued\n298,244\n260,059\n220,984\nAverage monthly rate of new policies issued per life-licensed\nsales representative\n0.22\n0.21\n0.19\nThe increase in new life insurance policies issued in 2016 from 2015 reflected the positive impact of strong growth in the size of our life-licensed sales force in recent periods. Productivity, measured by the average monthly rate of new policies issued per life-licensed sales representative continues to be at the higher end of our historical range due to the positive sales momentum generated within our\n38\nindependent sales force.\nThe number of new life insurance policies also increased in 2015 compared to 2014 mostly due to the factors discussed above in the com\nparison of 2016 to 2015.\nThe changes in the face amount of our in-force book of term life insurance policies were as follows.\nYear ended December 31,\n2016% of beginning balance\n2015% of beginning balance\n2014% of beginning balance\n(Dollars in millions)\nFace amount in force, beginning of period\n$693,194\n$681,927\n$674,868\nNet change in face amount.\nIssued face amount\n89,869\n13%\n79,111\n12%\n69,574\n10%\nTerminations\n(57,238\n)\n(8\n)%\n(53,580\n)\n(8\n)%\n(54,962\n)\n(8\n)%\nForeign currency\n2,560\n*\n(14,264\n)\n(2\n)%\n(7,553\n)\n(1\n)%\nNet change in face amount\n35,191\n5%\n11,267\n2%\n7,059\n1%\nFace amount in force, end of period\n$728,385\n$693,194\n$681,927\n*\nLess than 1%.\nThe face amount of term life insurance policies in force increased 5% during 2016 compared to a 2% growth during 2015 primarily due to the positive impact of strong new policy sales issued and stable persistency levels, which allowed issued face amount to outpace policy terminations face amount. As a percentage of the beginning face amount in force, issued face amount continued to grow due to higher sales, while terminations face amount remained consistent with the prior year. Overall, the increase in total face amount of policies in force as of December 31, 2016 compared to December 31, 2015 was primarily driven by the volume growth in new policies issued. Our average issued face amount in 2016 was also consistent with 2015 at approximately $241,500 and $241,700, respectively.\nIn 2015, the face amount of term life insurance policies in force increased compared with 2014 also as a result of the higher number of policies issued combined with policy terminations remaining stable. However, the magnitude of the increase in face amount in 2015 versus 2014 was mitigated due to the year-over-year impact of a much stronger U.S. dollar in relation to the Canadian dollar, which reduced the translated face amount of existing Canadian policies in force. In 2015, our average issued face amount of approximately $241,700 in 2015 decreased as compared with approximately $244,600 in 2014 primarily due to the translation impact of the weaker Canadian dollar.\nInvestment and Savings Product Sales, Asset Values and Accounts.\nInvestment and savings products sales and average client asset values were as follows.\nYear ended December 31,\n2016 vs. 2015 change\n2015 vs. 2014 change\n2016\n2015\n2014\n$%\n$%\n(Dollars in millions)\nProduct sales.\nRetail mutual funds\n$3,279\n$3,259\n$3,210\n$20\n1%\n$49\n2%\nAnnuities and other\n1,813\n2,004\n1,971\n(191\n)\n(10\n)%\n33\n2%\nTotal sales-based revenue\ngenerating product sales\n5,092\n5,263\n5,181\n(171\n)\n(3\n)%\n82\n2%\nManaged investments\n212\n247\n258\n(35\n)\n(14\n)%\n(11\n)\n(4\n)%\nSegregated funds and other\n290\n347\n243\n(57\n)\n(16\n)%\n104\n43%\nTotal product sales\n$5,594\n$5,857\n$5,682\n$(263\n)\n(4\n)%\n$175\n3%\nAverage client asset values.\nRetail mutual funds\n$30,566\n$30,429\n$29,939\n$137\n*\n$490\n2%\nAnnuities and other\n14,880\n14,258\n13,268\n622\n4%\n990\n7%\nManaged investments\n1,720\n1,518\n1,238\n202\n13%\n280\n23%\nSegregated funds\n2,262\n2,272\n2,491\n(10\n)\n*\n(219\n)\n(9\n)%\nTotal average client asset values\n$49,428\n$48,477\n$46,936\n$951\n2%\n$1,541\n3%\n*\nLess than 1%.\n39\nThe rollforward of asset values in client accounts was as follows.\nYear ended December 31,\n2016% of beginning balance\n2015% of beginning balance\n2014% of beginning balance\n(Dollars in millions)\nAsset values, beginning of period\n$47,354\n$48,656\n$44,990\nNet change in asset values.\nInflows\n5,594\n12%\n5,857\n12%\n5,682\n13%\nRedemptions\n(4,620\n)\n(10\n)%\n(4,843\n)\n(10\n)%\n(4,823\n)\n(11\n)%\nNet inflows\n974\n2%\n1,014\n2%\n859\n2%\nChange in market value, net\n3,758\n8%\n(859\n)\n(2\n)%\n3,555\n8%\nForeign currency, net\n254\n1%\n(1,457\n)\n(3\n)%\n(748\n)\n(2\n)%\nNet change in asset values\n4,986\n11%\n(1,302\n)\n(3\n)%\n3,666\n8%\nAsset values, end of period\n$52,340\n$47,354\n$48,656\nAverage number of fee-generating positions was as follows.\nYear ended December 31,\n2016 vs. 2015 change\n2015 vs. 2014 change\n2016\n2015\n2014\n$%\n$%\n(Positions in thousands)\nAverage number of fee-generating\npositions\n(1)\n.\nRecordkeeping and custodial\n2,201\n2,150\n2,015\n51\n2%\n135\n7%\nRecordkeeping only\n677\n653\n607\n24\n4%\n46\n8%\nTotal average number of fee-\ngenerating positions\n2,878\n2,803\n2,622\n75\n3%\n181\n7%\n(1)\nWe receive recordkeeping fees by mutual fund positions.

We may also receive fees earned for custodial services that we provide to clients with retirement plan accounts that hold positions in these mutual funds.\nProduct sales.\nThe decrease in investment and savings product sales in 2016 from 2015 was largely attributed to an industry-wide weakness in variable annuity sales, partially offset by positive sales in U.S. retail mutual fund and fixed indexed annuity sales. Our annuity sales activity has been consistent with an industry-wide shift from variable annuities to fixed indexed annuities while positive market performance in recent periods has increased demand for U.S. retail mutual funds.\nIn 2015, investment and savings product sales increased from 2014 as favorable market conditions, most notably in the first half of the year, drove customer demand for our product sales. The year-over-year increase in investment and savings products was partially offset by the translation impact of the weaker Canadian dollar in relation to the U.S. dollar.\nAverage client asset values.\nAverage client asset values increased in 2016 from 2015 largely due to favorable market performance throughout the year and continued net positive inflows.\nThe growth in average client asset values in 2015 can be attributed to the impact of positive net investment inflows during 2015 and favorable market performance during the first half of 2015. The positive effect of these items on average client asset values was partially offset by the foreign currency translation impact of the weaker Canadian dollar as well as the negative impact of market volatility in the second half of 2015.\nRollforward of client asset values.\nClient asset values increased during 2016 compared to a decrease during 2015 primarily due to an increase in market value and continued net inflows from product sales, which outpaced redemptions. Also contributing to the increase in client asset values was the positive impact of the translated value of client assets in Canada due to the strengthening of the Canadian dollar relative to the U.S. dollar.\nThe decrease in client asset values during 2015 was largely due to the currency translation impact of the lower Canadian dollar on Canadian client assets as well as negative market performance in the second half of 2015. The impact of these items was partially offset by positive net investment inflows.\nAverage number of fee-generating positions.\nThe average number of fee-generating positions increased in 2016 from 2015 primarily due to the cumulative effect of product sales of mutual funds and managed accounts investments that are serviced on the Company\u2019s recordkeeping and custodial services platform.\nThe average number of fee-generating positions increased in 2015 from 2014 primarily due to the addition of a mutual fund provider on our recordkeeping and custodial services platform during the first quarter of 2015 as well as growth in our mutual funds and managed accounts business.\n40\nRegulatory changes on business trends.\nRegulatory changes can also impact our product sales. On April 8, 2016, the Department\nof Labor (\u201cDOL\u201d) published a final regulation (\u201cthe DOL Fiduciary Rule\u201d), which more broadly defines the circumstances under which a person or entity may be considered a fiduciary for purposes of the prohibited transaction rules of the Employee Retirement\nIncome Security Act and Internal Revenue Code (\u201cIRC\u201d) Section 4975. IRC Section 4975 prohibits certain types of compensation paid by third parties with respect to transactions involving assets in qualified accounts, including individual retirement account\ns (\u201cIRAs\u201d). In connection with the DOL Fiduciary Rule, the DOL also issued new exemptions and amended several existing exemptions.\nOn February 3, 2017, the President of the United States issued a memorandum directing the DOL to review the DOL Fiduciary Rul\ne to determine, based on certain factors, whether the rule should be revised or rescinded. The DOL Fiduciary Rule, which was set to become \u201capplicable\u201d on April 10, 2017, may be delayed for an unspecified period while the Secretary of Labor prepares an upd\nated economic and legal analysis on the impact of the DOL Fiduciary Rule.\nIRAs and other qualified accounts are an important component of the investment and savings products we distribute. If it were to become applicable in its current form, we believe that the DOL Fiduciary Rule would necessitate certain changes to our qualified plan business in order for us to continue to help investors save for retirement. Because of the uncertainty of the status of the DOL Fiduciary Rule, we have not yet finalized our plans or determined the extent and nature of those changes. Additionally, we have not determined the extent to which we would make necessitated compensation, product or other changes to our qualified plan business, nor whether we would make such changes consistent across our non-qualified business. As a result, we are currently unable to quantify the impact on our business, financial position or results of operations. During the year ended December 31, 2016, average client assets held in U.S. qualified retirement plans accounted for an estimated 59%\nof total average client account assets. During the year ended December 31, 2016, product sales of assets held in U.S. qualified retirement plans accounted for approximately 56%\nof total investment and savings product sales.\nFactors Affecting Our Results\nTerm Life Insurance Segment.\nOur Term Life Insurance segment results are primarily driven by sales volumes, the accuracy of our pricing assumptions, terms and use of reinsurance, and expenses.\nSales and policies in force.\nSales of term policies and the size and characteristics of our in-force book of policies are vital to our results over the long term. Premium revenue is recognized as it is earned over the term of the policy, and eligible acquisition expenses are deferred and amortized ratably with the level premiums of the underlying policies. However, because we incur significant cash outflows at or about the time policies are issued, including the payment of sales commissions and underwriting costs, changes in life insurance sales volume will have a more immediate effect on our cash flows.\nHistorically, we have found that while sales volume of term life insurance products between fiscal periods may vary based on a variety of factors, the productivity of our individual sales representatives generally remains within a relatively narrow range (i.e., an average monthly rate of new policies issued per life-licensed sales representative between 0.18 and 0.22), and, consequently, our sales volume over the longer term generally correlates to the size of our sales force.\nPricing assumptions.\nOur pricing methodology is intended to provide us with appropriate profit margins for the risks we assume. We determine pricing classifications based on the coverage sought, such as the size and term of the policy, and certain policyholder attributes, such as age and health. In addition, we generally utilize unisex rates for our term life insurance policies. The pricing assumptions that underlie our rates are based upon our best estimates of mortality, persistency and interest rates at the time of issuance, sales force commission rates, issue and underwriting expenses, operating expenses and the characteristics of the insureds, including the distribution of sex, age, underwriting class, product and amount of coverage. Our results will be affected to the extent there is a variance between our pricing assumptions and actual experience.\n\u2022\nPersistency\n. Persistency is a measure of how long our insurance policies stay in force. As a general matter, persistency that is lower than our pricing assumptions adversely affects our results over the long term because we lose the recurring revenue stream associated with the policies that lapse. Determining the near-term effects of changes in persistency is more complicated. When actual persistency is lower than our pricing assumptions, we must accelerate the amortization of deferred policy acquisition costs (\u201cDAC\u201d). The resultant increase in amortization expense is offset by a corresponding release of reserves associated with lapsed policies, which causes a reduction in benefits and claims expense. The future policy benefit reserves associated with any given policy will change over the term of such policy. As a general matter, future policy benefit reserves are lowest at the inception of a policy term and rise steadily to a peak before declining to zero at the expiration of the policy term. Accordingly, depending on when the lapse occurs in relation to the overall policy term, the reduction in benefits and claims expense may be greater or less than the increase in amortization expense, and, consequently, the effects on earnings for a given period could be positive or negative. Persistency levels will impact results to the extent actual experience deviates from the persistency assumptions used to price our products.\n\u2022\nMortality.\nOur profitability will fluctuate to the extent actual mortality rates differ from those used in our pricing assumptions. We mitigate a significant portion of our mortality exposure through reinsurance.\n\u2022\nInterest Rates.\nWe use an assumption for future interest rates that initially reflects the current low interest rate environment gradually increasing to a level consistent with historical experience. Both DAC and the future policy benefit reserve liability increase with the assumed interest rate. Since DAC is higher than the future policy benefit reserve liability in the early years of a policy, a lower assumed interest rate generally will result in lower profits. In the later years, when the future policy benefit\n41\nreserve liability is higher than DAC, a lower assumed interest rate generally will result in higher profits. These assumed interest rates, which like other pricing assumptions are locked in at issue, impact the timing but not the aggregat\ne amount of DAC and future policy benefit reserve changes.\nWe allocate net investment income generated by the investment portfolio to the Term Life Insurance segment in an amount equal to the assumed net interest accreted to the segment\u2019s U.S. generally ac\ncepted accounting principles (\u201cU.S. GAAP\u201d)-measured future policy benefit reserve liability less DAC. All remaining net investment income, and therefore the impact of actual interest rates, is attributed to the Corporate and Other Distributed Products segm\nent.\nReinsurance.\nWe use reinsurance extensively, which has a significant effect on our results of operations. Since the mid-1990s, we have reinsured between 60% and 90% of the mortality risk on our U.S. term life insurance policies on a quota share yearly renewable term (\u201cYRT\u201d) basis. In Canada, historically, we utilized reinsurance arrangements similar to the U.S. in certain years and reinsured only face amounts above $500,000 in other years. However, in the first quarter of 2012, we entered into a YRT reinsurance arrangement in Canada similar to our U.S. program. YRT reinsurance permits us to set future mortality at contractual rates by policy class. To the extent actual mortality experience is more or less favorable than the contractual rate, the reinsurer will earn incremental profits or bear the incremental cost, as applicable. In contrast to coinsurance, which is intended to eliminate all risks (other than counterparty risk of the reinsurer) and rewards associated with a specified percentage of the block of policies subject to the reinsurance arrangement, the YRT reinsurance arrangements we enter into are intended only to reduce volatility associated with variances between estimated and actual mortality rates.\nIn 2010, as part of our corporate reorganization and the initial public offering of our common stock, we entered into significant coinsurance transactions (the \u201cIPO coinsurance transactions\u201d) with entities then affiliated with Citigroup, Inc. (collectively, the \u201cIPO coinsurers\u201d) and ceded between 80% and 90% of the risks and rewards of our term life insurance policies that were in force at year-end 2009. We continue to administer all policies subject to these coinsurance agreements.\nThe effect of our reinsurance arrangements on ceded premiums and benefits and expenses on our statement of income follows.\n\u2022\nCeded premiums.\nCeded premiums are the premiums we pay to reinsurers. These amounts are deducted from the direct premiums we earn to calculate our net premium revenues. Similar to direct premium revenues, ceded coinsurance premiums remain level over the initial term of the insurance policy. Ceded YRT premiums increase over the period that the policy has been in force. Accordingly, ceded YRT premiums generally constitute an increasing percentage of direct premiums over the policy term.\n\u2022\nBenefits and claims.\nBenefits and claims include incurred claim amounts and changes in future policy benefit reserves. Reinsurance reduces incurred claims in direct proportion to the percentage ceded. Coinsurance also reduces the change in future policy benefit reserves in direct proportion to the percentage ceded, while YRT reinsurance does not significantly impact the change in these reserves.\n\u2022\nAmortization of DAC.\nDAC, and therefore amortization of DAC, is reduced on a pro-rata basis for the coinsured business, including the business reinsured with the IPO coinsurers. There is no impact on amortization of DAC associated with our YRT contracts.\n\u2022\nInsurance expenses.\nInsurance expenses are reduced by the allowances received from coinsurance. There is no impact on insurance expenses associated with our YRT contracts.\nWe may alter our reinsurance practices at any time due to the unavailability of YRT reinsurance at attractive rates or the availability of alternatives to reduce our risk exposure. We presently intend to continue ceding approximately 90% of our U.S. and Canadian mortality risk on new business.\nExpenses.\nResults are also affected by variances in client acquisition, maintenance and administration expense levels.\nInvestment and Savings Products Segment.\nOur Investment and Savings Products segment results are primarily driven by sales, the value of assets in client accounts for which we earn ongoing management, marketing and support, and distribution fees, and the number of recordkeeping and custodial-fee generating positions we administer.\nSales.\nWe earn commissions and fees, such as dealer re-allowances, and marketing and support fees, based on sales of mutual fund products and annuities. Sales of investment and savings products are influenced by the overall demand for investment products in the United States and Canada, as well as by the size and productivity of our sales force. We generally experience seasonality in our Investment and Savings Products segment results due to our high concentration of sales of retirement account products. These accounts are typically funded in February through April, coincident with our clients\u2019 tax return preparation season. While we believe the size of our sales force is a factor in driving sales volume in this segment, there are a number of other variables, such as economic and market conditions, which may have a significantly greater effect on sales volume in any given fiscal period.\nAsset values in client accounts.\nWe earn marketing and support fees as well as distribution fees (trail commissions or, with respect to U.S. mutual funds, 12b-1 fees) on mutual fund and annuity assets in the United States and Canada. In the United States, we also earn investment advisory fees on assets in the managed investments program. In Canada, we earn management fees on certain mutual fund assets and on the segregated funds for which we serve as investment manager. Asset values are influenced by new product sales, ongoing contributions to existing accounts, redemptions and the change in market values in existing accounts. While we offer a wide variety of asset classes and investment styles, our clients\u2019 accounts are primarily invested in equity funds.\n42\nPositions.\nWe earn recordkeeping fees for admini\nstrative functions we perform on behalf of several of our retail and managed mutual fund providers.\nAn individual client account may include multiple fund positions for which we earn recordkeeping fees. We may also receive fees earned for non-bank custodia\nl services that we provide to clients with retirement plan accounts.\nSales mix.\nWhile our investment and savings products all provide similar long-term economic returns to the Company, our results in a given fiscal period will be affected by changes in the overall mix of products within these categories. Examples of changes in the sales mix that influence our results include the following.\n\u2022\nsales of annuity products in the United States will generate higher revenues in the period such sales occur than sales of other investment products that either generate lower upfront revenues or, in the case of managed investments and segregated funds, no upfront revenues;\n\u2022\nsales of a higher proportion of managed investments and segregated funds products will generally extend the time over which revenues can be earned because we are entitled to higher revenues based on assets under management for these accounts in lieu of upfront revenues; and\n\u2022\nsales of a higher proportion of mutual fund products and the composition of the fund families sold will impact the timing and amount of revenue we earn given the marketing, support, recordkeeping and custodial services we provide for the various mutual fund products we distribute.\nCorporate and Other Distributed Products Segment.\nWe earn revenues and pay commissions and referral fees for various other insurance products, prepaid legal services and other financial products, all of which are originated by third parties. National Benefit Life Insurance Company (\u201cNBLIC\u201d) also has in-force policies from several discontinued lines of insurance. At the beginning of 2014, NBLIC sold its short-term statutory disability benefit insurance business to AmTrust North America, Inc., and the net gain recognized on the sale was reported as discontinued operations in 2014. Also during 2014, NBLIC ceased the marketing and underwriting of new student life insurance policies but it continues to administer the existing block of student life business.\nCorporate and Other Distributed Products segment net investment income reflects actual net investment income realized by the Company less the amount allocated to our Term Life Insurance segment based on the assumed net interest accreted to the segment\u2019s U.S. GAAP-measured future policy benefit reserve liability less DAC. Actual net investment income reflected in the Corporate and Other Distributed Products segment is impacted by the size and performance of our invested asset portfolio, which can be influenced by interest rates, credit spreads, and the mix of invested assets.\nThe Corporate and Other Distributed Products segment is also affected by corporate income and expenses not allocated to our other segments, general and administrative expenses (other than expenses that are allocated to our Term Life Insurance or Investment and Savings Products segments), interest expense on notes payable and reserve financing transactions as well as realized gains and losses on our invested asset portfolio.\nCapital Structure.\nOur financial results are affected by our capital structure, which includes our senior unsecured notes (the \u201cSenior Notes\u201d) and common stock. See Note 10 (Debt), Note 12 (Stockholders\u2019 Equity) and Note 16 (Commitments and Contingent Liabilities) to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report for more information on changes in our capital structure.\nForeign Currency.\nThe Canadian dollar is the functional currency for our Canadian subsidiaries and our consolidated financial results, reported in U.S. dollars, are affected by changes in the currency exchange rate. As such, the translated amount of revenues, expenses, assets and liabilities attributable to our Canadian subsidiaries will be higher or lower in periods where the Canadian dollar appreciates or weakens relative to the U.S. dollar, respectively. While the Canadian dollar spot rate relative to the U.S. dollar has improved during 2016, it remains lower as compared with 2014 due to the significant decline in the value of the Canadian dollar relative to the U.S. dollar in 2015.\nThe year-over-year increase in the year-end exchange rates used by the Company to translate our Canadian dollar functional currency assets and liabilities into U.S. dollars was 4% in 2016 from 2015 and it decreased by 17% from 2015 to 2014. The year-over-year decrease in the average exchange rates used by the Company to translate our Canadian dollar functional currency revenues and expenses into U.S. dollars was 4% in 2016 from 2015 and 14% in 2015 from 2014.\nSee \u201cResults of Operations\u201d and \u201cFinancial Condition\u201d and \u201cQuantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk \u2013 Canadian Currency Risk\u201d and Note 3 (Segment and Geographical Information) to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report for more information on our Canadian subsidiaries and the impact of foreign currency on our financial results.\n43\nCritical Accounting Estimates\nWe prepare our financial statements in accordance with U.S GAAP. These principles are established primarily by the Financial Accounting Standards Board. The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires us to make estimates and assumptions based on currently available information when recording transactions resulting from business operations. Our significant accounting policies are described in Note 1 (Description of Business, Basis of Presentation, and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies) to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report. The most significant items on our consolidated balance sheets are based on fair value determinations, accounting estimates and actuarial determinations, which are susceptible to changes in future periods and could affect our results of operations and financial position.\nThe estimates that we deem to be most critical to an understanding of our results of operations and financial position are those related to DAC, future policy benefit reserves and corresponding amounts due from reinsurers, income taxes, and the valuation of investments. The preparation and evaluation of these critical accounting estimates involve the use of various assumptions developed from management\u2019s analyses and judgments. Subsequent experience or use of other assumptions could produce significantly different results.\nDeferred Policy Acquisition Costs.\nWe defer incremental direct costs of successful contract acquisitions that result directly from and are essential to the contract transaction(s) and that would not have been incurred had the contract transaction(s) not occurred. These costs include commissions and policy issue expenses. Deferrable term life insurance policy acquisition costs are amortized over the initial premium-paying period of the related policies in proportion to premium income and include assumptions made by us regarding persistency, expenses, interest rates and claims, which are updated on new business to reflect recent experience. These assumptions may not be modified, or unlocked on in-force term life insurance business, unless recoverability testing deems estimated future cash flows to be inadequate. DAC is subject to recoverability testing annually and when circumstances indicate that recoverability is uncertain.\nIf actual lapses are different from pricing assumptions for a particular period, DAC amortization for that period will be affected. If the rate of policies that lapse is 1% higher than the rate of policies that we expected to lapse in our original pricing assumptions, approximately 1% more of the existing DAC balance will be amortized, which would have been equal to approximately $16.3 million as of December 31, 2016 (assuming such lapses were distributed proportionately among policies of all durations). We believe that a lapse rate in the number of policies that is 1% higher than the rate assumed in our pricing assumptions is a reasonably possible variation. Higher lapses in the early durations would have a greater effect on DAC amortization since the DAC balances are higher at the earlier durations. Due to the inherent uncertainties in making assumptions about future events, materially different experience from expected results in persistency could result in a material increase or decrease of DAC amortization in a particular period.\nDeferrable acquisition costs for Canadian segregated funds are amortized over the life of the policies in relation to the present value of estimated gross profits expected to be realized over the life of the underlying policies. The gross profits and resulting DAC amortization will vary with actual and anticipated fund returns, redemptions, commissions and expenses. DAC from our Canadian segregated funds reflects approximately 3% of our total DAC, and DAC amortization on these segregated funds reflects approximately 3% of our total DAC amortization for the year ended December 31, 2016.\nFor additional information on DAC, see Note 1 (Description of Business, Basis of Presentation, and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies) and Note 7 (Deferred Policy Acquisition Costs) to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report.\nFuture Policy Benefit Reserves and Reinsurance.\nLiabilities for future policy benefits on our term life insurance products have been computed using a net level method and include assumptions as to mortality, persistency, interest rates, and other assumptions based on our historical experience, modified as necessary for new business to reflect anticipated trends and to include provisions for possible adverse deviation. Reserves related to reinsured policies are accounted for using assumptions consistent with those used to determine the future policy benefit reserves and are included in Due from reinsurers in our consolidated balance sheets. Similar to the term life insurance DAC discussion above, we do not modify the assumptions used to establish future policy benefit reserves during the policy term unless recoverability testing deems them to be inadequate and there is no remaining DAC associated with the underlying policies. Our results depend significantly upon the extent to which our actual experience is consistent with the assumptions we used in determining our future policy benefit reserves. Our future policy benefit reserve assumptions and estimates require significant judgment and, therefore, are inherently uncertain.\nIf the rate of policies that lapse is 1% higher than the rate of policies that we expected to lapse in our pricing assumptions, approximately 1% more of the future policy benefit reserves will be released, which would have been equal to approximately $54.6 million (assuming such lapses were distributed proportionately among policies of all durations), partially offset by the release of the corresponding due from reinsurers asset of approximately $38.6 million as of December 31, 2016, which decreases over time with the run-off of policies subject to the IPO coinsurance transactions. Higher lapses in later durations would have a greater effect on the release of future policy benefit reserves since the future policy benefit reserves are higher at the later durations.\nWe cannot determine with precision the ultimate amounts that we will pay for actual claims or the timing of those payments.\n44\nFor additional information on future policy benefits and reinsurance, see Note 1 (Description of Business, Basis of Presentation, and Summary of Significant\nAccounting Policies) and Note 6 (Reinsurance) to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report.\nIncome Taxes.\nWe account for income taxes using the asset and liability method. We recognize deferred tax assets and liabilities for the future tax consequences attributable to (i) temporary differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases and (ii) operating loss and tax credit carryforwards. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. We recognize the effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates in income in the period that includes the enactment date. Deferred tax assets are recognized subject to management\u2019s judgment that realization is more likely than not applicable to the periods in which we expect the temporary difference will reverse.\nIn light of the multiple tax jurisdictions in which we operate, our tax returns are subject to routine audit by the Internal Revenue Service and other taxation authorities. These audits at times may produce alternative views regarding particular tax positions taken in the year(s) of review. As a result, the Company records uncertain tax positions, which requires recognition at the time when it is deemed more likely than not that the position in question will be upheld. Although management believes that the judgment and estimates involved are reasonable and that the necessary provisions have been recorded, changes in circumstances or unexpected events could adversely affect our financial position, results of operations, and cash flows.\nFor additional information on income taxes, see Note 1 (Description of Business, Basis of Presentation, and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies) and Note 11 (Income Taxes) to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report.\nInvested Assets.\nWe hold primarily fixed-maturity securities, including bonds and redeemable preferred stocks, and equity securities, including common and non-redeemable preferred stock. We have classified these invested assets as available-for-sale, except for the securities of our U.S. broker-dealer subsidiary, which we have classified as trading securities. We also hold a credit-enhanced note, which we classified as a held-to-maturity security that was issued in exchange for a surplus note with an equal principal amount as part of a redundant reserve financing transaction. All of these securities are carried at fair value, except for the held-to-maturity security, which is carried at amortized cost. Unrealized gains and losses on available-for-sale securities, except for other-than-temporary impairments (\u201cOTTI\u201d) discussed below, are included as a separate component of other comprehensive income in our statements of comprehensive income. Changes in fair value of trading securities are included in net investment income in the accompanying consolidated statements of income in the period in which the change occurred.\nFair value.\nFair value is the price that would be received upon the sale of an asset in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. Fair value measurements are based upon observable and unobservable inputs. Observable inputs reflect market data obtained from independent sources, while unobservable inputs reflect our view of market assumptions in the absence of observable market information. We classify and disclose all invested assets carried at fair value in one of the three fair value measurement categories prescribed by U.S. GAAP.\nAs of each reporting period, we classify all invested assets in their entirety based on the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement. Significant levels of estimation and judgment are required to determine the fair value of certain of our investments. The factors influencing these estimations and judgments are subject to change in subsequent reporting periods.\nOTTI.\nThe determination of whether a decline in fair value of available-for-sale securities below amortized cost is other-than-temporary is subjective. Furthermore, this determination can involve a variety of assumptions and estimates, particularly for invested assets that are not actively traded in established markets. We evaluate a number of quantitative and qualitative factors when determining the impairment status of individual securities, including issuer-specific risks as well as relevant macroeconomic risks.\nFor available-for-sale securities in an unrealized loss position that we intend to sell or would more-likely-than-not be required to sell before the expected recovery of the amortized cost basis, we recognize an impairment charge for the difference between amortized cost and fair value as a realized investment loss in our statements of income. For available-for-sale fixed maturity securities in an unrealized loss position for which we have no intent to sell and believe that it is not more-likely-than-not that we will be required to sell before the expected recovery of the amortized cost basis, only the amount related to the principal cash flows not expected to be received over the remaining term of the security, or the credit loss component, of the difference between cost and fair value is recognized as a realized investment loss in our statements of income, while the remainder is recognized in other comprehensive income in our statements of comprehensive income.\nOTTI analyses that we perform involve the use of estimates, assumptions, and subjectivity. If these factors or future events change, we could experience material OTTI in future periods, which could adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations and the size and quality of our invested assets portfolio.\nFor additional information on our invested assets, see Note 1 (Description of Business, Basis of Presentation, and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies), Note 4 (Investments) and Note 5 (Fair Value of Financial Instruments) to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report.\n45\nResults of Operations\nRevenues.\nOur revenues consist of the following.\n\u2022\nNet premiums.\nReflects direct premiums payable by our policyholders on our in-force insurance policies, primarily term life insurance, net of reinsurance premiums that we pay to reinsurers.\n\u2022\nCommissions and fees.\nConsists primarily of dealer re-allowances earned on the sales of investment and savings products, trail commissions and management fees based on the asset values of client accounts, marketing and support fees from product originators, custodial fees for services rendered in our capacity as nominee on client retirement accounts funded by mutual funds on our servicing platform, recordkeeping fees for mutual funds on our servicing platform and fees associated with the sale of other distributed products.\n\u2022\nNet investment income.\nRepresents income, net of investment-related expenses, generated by our invested asset portfolio, which consists primarily of interest income earned on fixed-maturity investments.

Insurance expenses also include both indirect policy issuance costs and costs associated with unsuccessful efforts to acquire new policies.\n\u2022\nInsurance commissions.\nReflects sales commissions in respect of insurance products that are not eligible for deferral.\n\u2022\nInterest expense.\nReflects interest on our notes payable, the financing charges related to an issued letter of credit, fees paid for the credit enhancement feature on our held-to-maturity invested asset, and a finance charge incurred pursuant to one of our coinsurance agreements with an IPO coinsurer.\n\u2022\nOther operating expenses.\nConsists primarily of expenses that are unrelated to the distribution of insurance products, including staff compensation, technology and communications, various sales force-related costs, printing, postage and distribution of sales materials, outsourcing and professional fees, amortization of our definite-lived intangible asset and other corporate and administrative fees and expenses.\nInsurance expenses and other operating expenses directly attributable to the Term Life Insurance and the Investment and Savings Products segments are recorded directly to the applicable segment. We allocate certain other revenue and operating expenses that are not directly attributable to a specific operating segment based on the relative sizes of our life-licensed and securities-licensed independent sales forces. These allocated items include fees charged for access to our proprietary sales force support application and costs incurred for field technology, supervision, training and certain other costs. We also allocate certain technology and occupancy costs to our operating segments based on estimated usage. Costs that are not directly charged or allocated to our two primary operating segments are included in our Corporate and Other Distributed Products segment.\n46\nPrimerica, Inc. and Subsidiaries Results.\nOur results of operations for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015, and 2014 were as follows.\nYear ended December 31,\n2016 vs. 2015 change\n2015 vs. 2014 change\n2016\n2015\n2014\n$%\n$%\n(Dollars in thousands)\nRevenues.\nDirect premiums\n$2,444,268\n$2,345,444\n$2,301,332\n$98,824\n4%\n$44,112\n2%\nCeded premiums\n(1,600,559\n)\n(1,595,220\n)\n(1,616,817\n)\n5,339\n*\n(21,597\n)\n(1\n)%\nNet premiums\n843,709\n750,224\n684,515\n93,485\n12%\n65,709\n10%\nCommissions and fees\n541,686\n537,146\n527,166\n4,540\n1%\n9,980\n2%\nInvestment income net of investment expenses\n97,905\n89,557\n89,955\n8,348\n9%\n(398\n)\n*\nInterest expense on surplus note\n(18,880\n)\n(13,048\n)\n(3,482\n)\n5,832\n45%\n9,566\n275%\nNet investment income\n79,025\n76,509\n86,473\n2,516\n3%\n(9,964\n)\n(12\n)%\nRealized investment gains (losses), including\nother-than-temporary impairment losses\n4,088\n(1,738\n)\n(261\n)\n5,826\n335%\n1,477\n566%\nOther, net\n50,576\n42,058\n39,203\n8,518\n20%\n2,855\n7%\nTotal revenues\n1,519,084\n1,404,199\n1,337,096\n114,885\n8%\n67,103\n5%\nBenefits and expenses.\nBenefits and claims\n367,655\n339,315\n311,417\n28,340\n8%\n27,898\n9%\nAmortization of DAC\n180,582\n157,727\n144,378\n22,855\n14%\n13,349\n9%\nSales commissions\n272,815\n274,893\n268,775\n(2,078\n)\n(1\n)%\n6,118\n2%\nInsurance expenses\n132,348\n123,030\n113,871\n9,318\n8%\n9,159\n8%\nInsurance commissions\n17,783\n16,340\n15,353\n1,443\n9%\n987\n6%\nInterest expense\n28,691\n33,507\n34,570\n(4,816\n)\n(14\n)%\n(1,063\n)\n(3\n)%\nOther operating expenses\n181,615\n168,406\n173,010\n13,209\n8%\n(4,604\n)\n(3\n)%\nTotal benefits and expenses\n1,181,489\n1,113,218\n1,061,374\n68,271\n6%\n51,844\n5%\nIncome from continuing operations before\nincome taxes\n337,595\n290,981\n275,722\n46,614\n16%\n15,259\n6%\nIncome taxes on continuing operations\n118,181\n101,110\n95,888\n17,071\n17%\n5,222\n5%\nIncome from continuing operations\n219,414\n189,871\n179,834\n29,543\n16%\n10,037\n6%\nIncome from discontinued operations, net of\nincome taxes\n-\n-\n1,578\n-\n*\n(1,578\n)\n(100\n)%\nNet income\n$219,414\n$189,871\n$181,412\n$29,543\n16%\n$8,459\n5%\n*\nLess than 1%\nTotal revenues.\nTotal revenues increased in 2016 from 2015 largely due to incremental premiums on term life insurance policies that are not subject to the IPO coinsurance transactions as well as direct premiums growth reflecting the increase in the number of new policies issued in recent periods. Commissions and fees from our Investment and Savings Products segment increased modestly in 2016 compared to 2015 primarily due to higher asset-based revenues driven by the increase in average client asset values and higher account-based revenues primarily driven by an increase in our account-based fee structure on U.S. qualified accounts, offset by lower sales-based revenues due to weakness in variable annuity sales.\nNet investment income increased in 2016 from 2015 as increasing prices on fixed-income investments led to an approximately $4.7 million higher total return on the deposit asset backing the 10% coinsurance agreement that is subject to deposit method accounting. This increase was partially offset by approximately $2.1 million of lower investment income due to lower yield on a slightly larger invested asset portfolio. Interest expense on surplus note line item will fluctuate from period to period along with the principal amount of our surplus note (the \u201cSurplus Note\u201d) based on the balance of reserves being contractually supported under a redundant reserve financing transaction used by our Vidalia Re, Inc. (\u201cVidalia Re\u201d) captive insurance company. Investment inc\nome earned on our held-to-maturity invested asset completely offsets the interest expense on Surplus Note line item, thereby eliminating any impact on net investment income. For more information on the Surplus Note, see Note 10 (Debt) and for additional information on the redundant reserve financing transaction used by Vidalia Re, see Note 4 (Investments) to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report.\nRealized investment gains (losses), including OTTI losses, increased primarily due to higher realized investment gains we recognized in the second quarter of 2016 from the sale of certain securities where the Company was able to reduce its exposure to specific issuers, as well as a lower amount of impairments on certain investments in our invested asset portfolio.\nOther, net revenues increased during 2016 compared to 2015 largely due to the increase in fees for our proprietary sales force support system, consistent with subscriber growth. We allocate fees collected for our proprietary sales force support system between our Term Life Insurance segment and our Investment and Savings Products segment based on the estimated number of sales force representatives that are licensed to sell products in each respective segment.\n47\nDurin\ng 2015, total revenues increased from 2014 primarily due to incremental premiums on term life insurance policies not subject to the IPO coinsurance transactions and higher direct premiums reflecting the increase in new policy sales in recent periods. Also\ncontributing to the year-over-year increase in revenues in 2015 versus 2014 were higher commissions and fees generated from our Investment and Savings Products segment as a result of investment and savings product sales growth and client asset values growt\nh.\nPartially offsetting the increase in revenues in 2015 from 2014 was a decline in net investment income, which was mostly attributed to lower yield on invested assets, lower total return on the deposit asset underlying the 10% coinsurance agreement, and lower income from called fixed-income securities. Increases in realized investment losses recognized in 2015 compared to 2014 also negatively impacted revenue as we recognized a higher amount of impairments on certain investments in our invested asset portfolio, most notably in the fourth quarter of 2015, which we deemed to be other-than-temporarily impaired as a result of factors specific to the issuer or our intent to sell the investment in the near term. Also offsetting the year-over-year increase in revenues in 2015 was the translation impact of the weaker Canadian dollar in relation to the U.S. dollar. Measured in constant currency by translating 2015 Canadian local currency revenues using the average 2014 exchange rate, the year-over-year impact from the decrease in exchange rates negatively impacted revenues in 2015 by approximately $36.2 million.\nTotal benefits and expenses.\nTotal benefits and expenses increased in 2016 from 2015 reflecting growth in premium-related expenses, which include benefits and claims, amortization of DAC and insurance expenses. Also contributing to the increase in insurance expenses and other operating expenses was higher spending of approximately $10.4 million for our proprietary sales force support system\u2019s mobile application as well as accommodating increased capacity for the growth in subscribers, higher employee-related costs of approximately $4.3 million, and costs related to preparing for the implementation of the DOL Fiduciary Rule of approximately $3.3 million. These increases were partially offset by the decline in interest expense incurred on our 10% coinsurance agreement which is discussed further in Note 6 (Reinsurance) to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report.\nThe increase in total benefits and expenses in 2015 from 2014 was in line with the increase in total revenues. The growth in benefits and claims, amortization of DAC, and insurance expenses was generally consistent with the percentage increase in net premiums. In addition, the increase in sales commissions was largely in line with the percentage increase in commissions and fees revenues. Similar to revenues, the impact of Canadian foreign exchange rates partially offset the increase in total benefits and expenses. In 2015, total benefits and expenses of our Canadian subsidiaries translated into U.S. dollars was approximately $26.1 million lower than 2014 as measured on a constant currency basis.\nIncome taxes.\nOur effective income tax rate was relatively consistent each year at 35.0%, 34.7%, and 34.8% in 2016, 2015, and 2014, respectively.\nFor additional information, see the discussions of results of operations by segment below.\nTerm Life Insurance Segment.\nOur results for the Term Life Insurance segment for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015, and 2014 were as follows.\nYear ended December 31,\n2016 vs. 2015 change\n2015 vs. 2014 change\n2016\n2015\n2014\n$%\n$%\n(Dollars in thousands)\nRevenues.\nDirect premiums\n$2,413,340\n$2,313,133\n$2,266,649\n$100,207\n4%\n$46,484\n2%\nCeded premiums\n(1,591,133\n)\n(1,584,952\n)\n(1,605,965\n)\n6,181\n*\n(21,013\n)\n(1\n)%\nNet Premiums\n822,207\n728,181\n660,684\n94,026\n13%\n67,497\n10%\nAllocated net investment income\n7,634\n5,987\n4,444\n1,647\n28%\n1,543\n35%\nOther, net\n36,541\n29,790\n27,257\n6,751\n23%\n2,533\n9%\nTotal revenues\n866,382\n763,958\n692,385\n102,424\n13%\n71,573\n10%\nBenefits and expenses.\nBenefits and claims\n350,640\n322,232\n295,332\n28,408\n9%\n26,900\n9%\nAmortization of DAC\n172,812\n147,980\n133,331\n24,832\n17%\n14,649\n11%\nInsurance expenses\n125,268\n116,290\n107,617\n8,978\n8%\n8,673\n8%\nInsurance commissions\n4,301\n4,247\n4,004\n54\n1%\n243\n6%\nTotal benefits and expenses\n653,021\n590,749\n540,284\n62,272\n11%\n50,465\n9%\nIncome from continuing operations\nbefore income taxes\n$213,361\n$173,209\n$152,101\n$40,152\n23%\n$21,108\n14%\n*\nLess than 1%\nNet premiums.\nDirect premiums grew in 2016 from 2015 largely due to the increase in the number of new policies issued in recent periods. The change in ceded premiums reflected our increasing non-level YRT ceded premiums and the run-off of business subject to the IPO coinsurance transactions. The sustained impact of growth in direct premiums and the run-off of business subject to the IPO coinsurance transactions resulted in net premiums growing faster than direct premiums.\n48\nThe increase in net premiums in 2015 from 2014 was largely due to the factors discussed above in the comparison of 2016 to 2015.\nIn addition, the weaker Canadian dollar caused lower direct premium gro\nwth and a higher run-off of the Canadian business subject to the IPO coinsurance transactions, which negatively impacted net premiums in 2015 by approximately $14.0 million compared with 2014 when measured on a constant currency basis.\nBenefits and claims.\nThe increase in benefits and claims in 2016 from 2015 was primarily driven by the growth in net premiums. However, benefits and claims increased at a slower rate than net premiums primarily due to disabled life premium waiver claims experience during 2016 being an estimated $5 million lower than historical levels, YRT rate reductions negotiated for 2014 and later issue years and modestly lower persistency. Death claims were relatively consistent with historical experience.\nIn comparing 2015 to 2014, benefits and claims also grew in line with net premiums due to YRT rate reductions negotiated for 2014 and later issue years partially offset by persistency improvements in 2015 versus 2014. Death claims for both 2015 and 2014 were in-line with historical averages.\nAmortization of DAC.\nThe amortization of DAC increased for 2016 from 2015 largely due to growth in net premiums. The increase in DAC amortization was higher than the increase in net premiums reflecting modestly lower persistency than the prior year as well as a higher amount of commissions deferred in recent periods.\nThe increase in amortization of DAC in 2015 compared to 2014 was also impacted by a higher amount of commissions deferred in recent periods, resulting in a rate of DAC amortization in excess of the growth in net premiums. This increase was mostly offset by improved persistency in 2015.\nInsurance expenses.\nGrowth in the business and the run-off of expense allowances related to the IPO coinsurance transactions resulted in a year-over-year increase in insurance expenses of approximately $4.4 million in 2016 compared with 2015. Increased spending associated with our proprietary sales force support system\u2019s mobile application also contributed to the increase in insurance expenses by approximately $8.5 million. During 2015, we reallocated certain employee-related expenses from the Term Life Insurance segment to the Corporate and Other Distributed Products segment due to the change in the Company\u2019s management structure that occurred in April 2015. The approximately $3.3 million full-year effect of the reallocated expenses, when combined with higher employee merit and headcount expenses in 2016 of approximately $2.3 million, resulted in a net decrease of approximately $1.0 million in the segment\u2019s employee-related expenses in 2016 versus 2015. Furthermore, several miscellaneous cost saving items in 2016 that aggregated to approximately $3.0 million in lower insurance expenses affected the year-over-year change.\nIn comparing 2015 to 2014, the growth in the business and the run-off of expense allowances related to the IPO coinsurance transactions resulted in a year-over-year increase in insurance expenses of approximately $5.5 million. Costs related to our proprietary sales force support system\u2019s mobile application increased by approximately $2.8 million in 2015 versus 2014. Higher employee-related costs increased insurance expenses by approximately $1.8 million in 2015 but were largely offset by a reduction in the translated amount of Canadian functional currency insurance expenses as a result of the weaker Canadian dollar compared with 2014.\nInvestment and Savings Products Segment.\nOur results of operations for the Investment and Savings Products segment for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015, and 2014 were as follows.\nYear ended December 31,\n2016 vs. 2015 change\n2015 vs. 2014 change\n2016\n2015\n2014\n$%\n$%\n(Dollars in thousands)\nRevenues.\nCommissions and fees.\nSales-based revenues\n$227,320\n$237,384\n$237,757\n$(10,064\n)\n(4\n)%\n$(373\n)\n*\nAsset-based revenues\n237,604\n231,919\n225,799\n5,685\n2%\n6,120\n3%\nAccount-based revenues\n50,861\n44,497\n40,477\n6,364\n14%\n4,020\n10%\nOther, net\n8,836\n7,536\n7,069\n1,300\n17%\n467\n7%\nTotal revenues\n524,621\n521,336\n511,102\n3,285\n1%\n10,234\n2%\nExpenses.\nAmortization of DAC\n6,148\n7,952\n8,734\n(1,804\n)\n(23\n)%\n(782\n)\n(9\n)%\nInsurance commissions\n11,456\n9,841\n8,799\n1,615\n16%\n1,042\n12%\nSales commissions.\nSales-based\n160,674\n167,883\n168,207\n(7,209\n)\n(4\n)%\n(324\n)\n*\nAsset-based\n99,639\n95,485\n88,974\n4,154\n4%\n6,511\n7%\nOther operating expenses\n102,348\n94,092\n90,371\n8,256\n9%\n3,721\n4%\nTotal expenses\n380,265\n375,253\n365,085\n5,012\n1%\n10,168\n3%\nIncome from continuing operations\nbefore income taxes\n$144,356\n$146,083\n$146,017\n$(1,727\n)\n(1\n)%\n$66\n*\n*\nLess than 1%\n49\nCommissions and fees.\nSales-based revenues decreased in 2016 compared to 2015 primarily driven by lower variable annuity sales.  Asset-based revenues increased in 2016 compared to 2015 due to the increase in average client asset values, which w\nas indicative of favorable market performance combined with continued net positive inflows. Account-based revenues also increased in 2016 compared to 2015 primarily due to an increase in our account-based fee structure on U.S. qualified accounts, which acc\nounted for a year-over-year increase of approximately $4.1 million, as well as the increase in the average number of fee-generating positions in mutual funds and managed accounts investments that are serviced on the Company\u2019s recordkeeping and custodial se\nrvices platform.\nThe increase in commissions and fees in 2015 from 2014 was largely attributable to growth in average client asset values as discussed earlier in the \u201cInvestment and Savings Product Sales, Asset Values and Accounts\u201d section. Account-based revenue increased largely due to the increase in the average number of fee generating accounts from the addition of a mutual fund provider on our recordkeeping and custodial services platform during 2015. Sales-based revenues were flat on a year-over-year basis as modest growth in sales-based revenue generating product sales was offset by a shift in product sales mix to product offerings with lower sales-based commission rates.\nAmortization of DAC.\nAmortization of DAC on our Canadian segregated funds product decreased in 2016 from 2015 largely due to the impact of favorable segregated funds market performance. The effect of lower redemption estimates for the 2016 annual update of assumptions based on emerging experience was in line with 2015 and therefore did not impact the year-over-year comparison of DAC amortization.\nIn 2015, amortization of DAC on our Canadian segregated funds product was lower compared to 2014 due to the translation impact from the decline in the Canadian exchange rate, which reduced amortization by approximately $1.7 million. The year-over-year decline in DAC amortization was partially offset by the lower adjustment (approximately $1.0 million in 2015 compared to approximately $2.4 million in 2014) to reduce amortization reflecting updated assumptions of future redemptions based on emerging experience.\nInsurance commissions.\nThe increase in insurance commissions in 2016 from 2015 was largely driven by a change in trail commission rate earned by the sales force on our Canadian segregated funds during the second quarter of 2015.\nInsurance commissions increased in 2015 compared with 2014 largely due to the factor discussed above in the comparison of 2016 to 2015. Partially offsetting the increase was the impact of approximately $1.5 million that the year-over-year decline in Canadian exchange rates had on the translated balance of insurance commissions reported.\nSales commissions.\nThe decline in sales-based commissions was in line with the decline in sales-based revenue. The increase in asset-based commissions slightly outpaced the increase in asset-based revenue primarily due to the change in product mix.\nThe decrease in sales-based commissions in 2015 from 2014 was relatively consistent with the decline in sales-based revenues. The increase in asset-based commissions outpaced the increase in asset-based revenues primarily due to the translation impact of the weaker Canadian dollar in relation to the U.S. dollar on Canadian segregated funds revenue included in asset-based revenue.\nOther operating expenses.\nOther operating expenses increased in 2016 from 2015 largely due to $3.3 million of higher costs related to preparation for the DOL Fiduciary Rule. In addition, increased spending associated with our proprietary sales force support system\u2019s mobile application resulted in approximately $2.4 million of higher operating expenses in 2016. Also contributing to the growth in operating expenses in 2016 as compared with 2015 were higher employee-related costs of approximately $0.9 million.\nThe increase in other operating expenses in 2015 from 2014 was primarily due to higher costs associated with the growth in the business. The year-over-year percentage growth in other operating expenses exceeded the percentage growth in total revenues due to several other business initiatives with the largest being approximately $0.9 million in higher spending on our proprietary sales force support system\u2019s mobile application.\n50\nCorporate and Other Distributed Products Segment.\nOur results of operations for the Corporate and Other Distributed Products segment for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015, and 2014 were as follows.\nYear ended December 31,\n2016 vs. 2015 change\n2015 vs. 2014 change\n2016\n2015\n2014\n$%\n$%\n(Dollars in thousands)\nRevenues.\nDirect premiums\n$30,928\n$32,311\n$34,683\n$(1,383\n)\n(4\n)%\n$(2,372\n)\n(7\n)%\nCeded premiums\n(9,426\n)\n(10,268\n)\n(10,852\n)\n(842\n)\n(8\n)%\n(584\n)\n(5\n)%\nNet Premiums\n21,502\n22,043\n23,831\n(541\n)\n(2\n)%\n(1,788\n)\n(8\n)%\nCommissions and fees\n25,901\n23,346\n23,133\n2,555\n11%\n213\n1%\nAllocated investment income net\nof investment expenses\n90,271\n83,570\n85,511\n6,701\n8%\n(1,941\n)\n(2\n)%\nInterest expense on surplus note\n(18,880\n)\n(13,048\n)\n(3,482\n)\n5,832\n45%\n9,566\n275%\nAllocated net investment income\n71,391\n70,522\n82,029\n869\n1%\n(11,507\n)\n(14\n)%\nRealized investment gains (losses), including\nother-than-temporary impairment losses\n4,088\n(1,738\n)\n(261\n)\n5,826\n335%\n1,477\n566%\nOther, net\n5,199\n4,732\n4,877\n467\n10%\n(145\n)\n(3\n)%\nTotal revenues\n128,081\n118,905\n133,609\n9,176\n8%\n(14,704\n)\n(11\n)%\nBenefits and expenses.\nBenefits and claims\n17,015\n17,083\n16,085\n(68\n)\n*\n998\n6%\nAmortization of DAC\n1,622\n1,795\n2,313\n(173\n)\n(10\n)%\n(518\n)\n(22\n)%\nInsurance expenses\n7,080\n6,740\n6,254\n340\n5%\n486\n8%\nInsurance commissions\n2,026\n2,252\n2,550\n(226\n)\n(10\n)%\n(298\n)\n(12\n)%\nSales commissions\n12,502\n11,525\n11,594\n977\n8%\n(69\n)\n(1\n)%\nInterest expense\n28,691\n33,507\n34,570\n(4,816\n)\n(14\n)%\n(1,063\n)\n(3\n)%\nOther operating expenses\n79,267\n74,314\n82,639\n4,953\n7%\n(8,325\n)\n(10\n)%\nTotal benefits and expenses\n148,203\n147,216\n156,005\n987\n1%\n(8,789\n)\n(6\n)%\nLoss from continuing operations before\nincome taxes\n$(20,122\n)\n$(28,311\n)\n$(22,396\n)\n$(8,189\n)\n(29\n)%\n$5,915\n26%\n*\nLess than 1%\nTotal revenues.\nTotal revenues increased in 2016 from 2015 partly due to commissions and fees revenue from stronger sales of other fee-based distributed products. Net premiums for the closed blocks of business issued by our NBLIC subsidiary decreased slightly due to the run-off of NBLIC\u2019s non-term life insurance block of business. The increase in allocated net investment income as well as realized investment gains (losses) was driven by the same factors discussed earlier in \u201cTotal revenues\u201d under the consolidated \u201cPrimerica, Inc. and Subsidiaries Results\u201d section.\nThe decrease in total revenues in 2015 from 2014 was primarily attributable to the decline in allocated net investment income and the increase in realized investment gains (losses) discussed earlier in \u201cTotal revenues\u201d under the consolidated \u201cPrimerica, Inc. and Subsidiaries Results\u201d section. Total revenue also decreased due to lower premiums attributable to the continued run-off of NBLIC\u2019s non-term life insurance closed block, which included the student life insurance business that ceased writing new policies in 2014.\nTotal Benefits and Expenses.\nTotal benefits and expenses increased in 2016 from 2015 primarily due to higher employee-related costs in other operating expenses of approximately $4.4 million, which includes the full-year effect of reallocated employee-related expenses of approximately $3.3 million between segments in the second quarter of 2015 as described earlier in the Term Life Insurance segment discussion. The increase was partially offset by the reduction in the interest expense incurred on our 10% coinsurance agreement. For more information on the interest expense incurred on our 10% coinsurance agreement, see Note 6 (Reinsurance) to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report.\nThe decrease in total benefits and expenses in 2015 from 2014 was primarily due to reduced other operating expenses of approximately $4.2 million reflecting the recognition of transition expenses for our former co-CEOs in 2014 that resulted from the modification of their employment terms, including ending their employment on April 1, 2015 instead of in August 2015. In addition, other operating expenses were reduced by approximately $4.0 million in 2015 versus 2014 as a sales force technology project associated with a non-core product offering ended and its related developed software was written off in 2014.\nFinancial Condition\nInvestments.\nOur insurance business is primarily focused on selling term life insurance, which does not include an investment component for the policyholder. The invested asset portfolio funded by premiums from our term life insurance business does not involve the substantial asset accumulations and spread requirements that exist with other non-term life insurance products. As a result, the profitability of our term life insurance business is not as sensitive to the impact that interest rates have on our invested asset portfolio and investment income as the profitability of other companies that distribute non-term life insurance products.\n51\nWe follow a conservative investment strategy designed to emphasize the preservation of our invested assets and provide adequate liquidity for the prompt payment of claims. To meet business needs and mitigate risks, our investment guidel\nines provide restrictions on our portfolio\u2019s composition, including limits on asset type, per issuer limits, credit quality limits, portfolio duration, limits on the amount of investments in approved countries and permissible security types. We also manage\nand monitor our allocation of investments to limit the accumulation of any disproportionate concentrations of risk among industry sectors or issuer countries outside of the U.S. and Canada. In addition, as of December 31, 2016, we did not hold any country\nof issuer concentrations outside of the U.S. or Canada that represented more than 5% of the fair value of our available-for-sale invested asset portfolio or any industry concentrations of corporate bonds that represented more than 10% of the fair value of\nour available-for-sale invested asset portfolio.\nWe may also direct our investment managers to invest some of our invested asset portfolio in currencies other than the U.S. dollar. For example, a portion of our portfolio is invested in assets denominated in Canadian dollars, which, at minimum, would equal our reserves for policies denominated in Canadian dollars. Additionally, to ensure adequate liquidity for payment of claims, we take into account the maturity and duration of our invested asset portfolio and our general liability profile.\nWe also hold within our invested asset portfolio a credit enhanced note (\u201cLLC Note\u201d) issued by a limited liability company owned by a third-party service provider which is classified as a held-to-maturity security. The LLC Note, which is scheduled to mature on December 31, 2029, was obtained in exchange for a surplus note of equal principal amount issued by Vidalia Re, a special purpose financial captive insurance company and wholly owned subsidiary of Primerica Life. For more information on the LLC Note, see Note 4 (Investments) to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report.\nWe have an investment committee composed of members of our senior management team that is responsible for establishing and maintaining our investment guidelines and supervising our investment activity. Our investment committee regularly monitors our overall investment results and our compliance with our investment objectives and guidelines. We use a third-party investment advisor to assist us in the management of our investing activities. Our investment advisor reports to our investment committee.\nOur invested asset portfolio is subject to a variety of risks, including risks related to general economic conditions, market volatility, interest rate fluctuations, liquidity risk and credit and default risk. Investment guideline restrictions have been established to minimize the effect of these risks but may not always be effective due to factors beyond our control. Interest rates are highly sensitive to many factors, including governmental monetary policies, domestic and international economic and political conditions and other factors beyond our control. A significant increase in interest rates could result in significant losses, realized or unrealized, in the value of our invested asset portfolio. Additionally, with respect to some of our investments, we are subject to prepayment and, therefore, reinvestment risk.\nDetails on asset mix (excluding our held-to-maturity security) were as follows.\nDecember 31, 2016\nDecember 31, 2015\nFair value\nCost or amortized cost\nFair value\nCost or amortized cost\nU.S. government and agencies\n1%\n1%\n1%\n1%\nForeign government\n6%\n6%\n6%\n6%\nStates and political subdivisions\n2%\n2%\n2%\n2%\nCorporates\n65%\n64%\n67%\n68%\nMortgage- and asset-backed securities\n14%\n14%\n13%\n13%\nEquity securities\n2%\n2%\n3%\n2%\nTrading securities\n*\n*\n*\n*\nCash and cash equivalents\n10%\n11%\n8%\n8%\nTotal\n100%\n100%\n100%\n100%\n*\nLess than 1%.\nThe composition and duration of our portfolio will vary depending on several factors, including the yield curve and our opinion of the relative value among various asset classes.

The amount of dividends paid by the subsidiaries is dependent on their capital needs to fund future growth and applicable regulatory restrictions. The primary uses of funds by the Parent Company include the payments of stockholder dividends, interest on notes payable, general operating\n53\nexpenses, and income taxes, as well as repurchases of shares outstanding. During 2016, our life insurance underwriting companies declared and paid ordinary dividends of $117.0 million\nto the Parent Company. See Note 15 (Statutory Accounting and Dividend Restrictions) to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report for more information on insurance subsidiary dividends and statutory restrictions. In addition, o\nur non-life insurance subsidiaries declared and paid dividends of approximately $72.5 million to the Parent Company in 2016. At December 31, 2016, the Parent Company had cash and invested assets of approximately $68.0 million.\nThe Parent Company\u2019s subsidiaries generate operating cash flows primarily from term life insurance premiums (net of premiums ceded to reinsurers), income from invested assets, commissions and fees collected from the distribution of investment and savings products as well as other financial products. The subsidiaries\u2019 principal operating cash outflows include the payment of insurance claims and benefits (net of ceded claims recovered from reinsurers), commissions to our sales force, insurance and other operating expenses, interest expense for future policy benefit reserves financing transactions, and income taxes.\nThe distribution and underwriting of term life insurance requires upfront cash outlays at the time the policy is issued as we pay a substantial majority of the sales commission during the first year following the sale of a policy and incur costs for underwriting activities at the inception of a policy\u2019s term. During the early years of a policy\u2019s term, we generally receive level term premiums in excess of claims paid. We invest the excess cash generated during earlier policy years in fixed-maturity and equity securities held in support of future policy benefit reserves. In later policy years, cash received from the maturity or sale of invested assets is used to pay claims in excess of level term premiums received.\nHistorically, cash flows generated by our businesses, primarily from our existing block of term life policies and our investment and savings products, have provided us with sufficient liquidity to meet our operating requirements. We anticipate that cash flows from our businesses will continue to provide sufficient operating liquidity over the next 12 months.\nWe may seek to enhance our liquidity position or capital structure through borrowings from third-party sources, sales of debt or equity securities, reserve financings or some combination of these sources. Additionally, we believe that cash flows from our businesses and potential sources of funding will sufficiently support our long-term liquidity needs.\nCash Flows.\nThe components of the changes in cash and cash equivalents were as follows.\nYear ended December 31,\n2016\n2015\n2014\n(In thousands)\nNet cash provided by (used in) operating activities\n$292,167\n$259,089\n$237,332\nNet cash provided by (used in) investing activities\n(47,923\n)\n(58,465\n)\n(15,645\n)\nNet cash provided by (used in) financing activities\n(185,134\n)\n(235,268\n)\n(175,883\n)\nEffect of foreign exchange rate changes on cash\n572\n(5,059\n)\n(2,789\n)\nChange in cash and cash equivalents\n$59,682\n$(39,703\n)\n$43,015\nOperating activities.\nThe increase in operating cash flows in 2016 from 2015 was partially the result of an increase in cash received from the collection of premium revenues in excess of benefits and claims paid in our Term Life Insurance segment. Growth in direct premiums as well as the additional layering of net premiums from term life insurance policies not subject to the IPO coinsurance transactions has continued to generate positive incremental cash flows after payments are made for policy acquisition costs during the first year that policies are issued. In addition, the timing of remittances for monthly reinsurance premiums to reinsurers as well as the timing impact of when outstanding checks were paid from our bank disbursement accounts at year end contributed to the increase in operating cash flows in 2016 as compared with 2015. Also contributing to the increase in operating cash flows in 2016 versus 2015 was lower cash income taxes in Canada relative to income tax expense incurred due to the timing of remittances to Canadian tax authorities. The year-over-year growth in new life insurance policies issued resulted in higher cash payments for DAC (net of income tax deductions) in 2016 as compared with 2015, which partially offset the year-over-year increase in operating cash flows.\nThe largest item contributing to the increase in net cash provided by operating activities in 2015 from 2014 was also driven by the impact of an additional year of term life insurance policies issued subsequent to the IPO coinsurance transactions. The year-over-year growth in new life insurance policies issued resulted in higher cash payments for DAC in 2015 as compared with 2014, which partially offset the year-over-year increase in operating cash flows.\nInvesting activities.\nThe decrease in cash used in investing activities in 2016 from 2015 was primarily driven by lower purchases of fixed-maturity securities as the Company accumulated a higher balance of short-term cash equivalent investments at the end of the year in pursuit of opportunities to reinvest in a rising interest rate environment. The decrease in cash used was partially offset by higher capital expenditures in 2016 for our information technology infrastructure.\nThe use of cash in investing activities increased in 2015 from 2014 primarily due to the purchase of available-for-sale investments with proceeds obtained from operating activities combined with the lower level of investments that matured or were called in 2015. The year-over-year change was partially offset by the accumulation of cash from sales of available-for-sale securities to fund our larger and accelerated share repurchases during 2015 compared to 2014.\n54\nFinancing activities.\nNet cash used in financing activities during 2016 decreased compared to 2015 as we utilized the additional $50 million of capacity authorized in our share repurchase programs in 2015 compared with 2016.\nCash used in financing activities during 2015 increased compared to 2014 primarily due to a larger amount of shares that were repurchased, which the Company increased in 2015 given our assessment of the market prices for which we had been able to execute our share repurchases. In addition, an increase in the dividends per share from 2014 to 2015 contributed to a higher amount of cash used in financing activities.\nRisk-Based Capital (\u201cRBC\u201d).\nThe National Association of Insurance Commissioners (\u201cNAIC\u201d) has established RBC standards for U.S. life insurers, as well as a risk-based capital model act (the \u201cRBC Model Act\u201d) that has been adopted by the insurance regulatory authorities. The RBC Model Act requires that life insurers annually submit a report to state regulators regarding their RBC based upon four categories of risk: asset risk; insurance risk; interest rate risk and business risk. The capital requirement for each is determined by applying factors that vary based upon the degree of risk to various asset, premiums and policy benefit reserve items. The formula is an early warning tool to identify possible weakly capitalized companies for purposes of initiating further regulatory action.\nAs of December 31, 2016, our U.S. life insurance subsidiaries had statutory capital substantially in excess of the applicable statutory requirements to support existing operations and to fund future growth. Primerica Life\u2019s RBC ratio remained well positioned to support existing operations and fund future growth.\nIn Canada, an insurer\u2019s minimum capital requirement is overseen by the Office of the Superintendent of Financial Institutions (\u201cOSFI\u201d) and determined as the sum of the capital requirements for five categories of risk: asset default risk; mortality\/morbidity\/lapse risks; changes in interest rate environment risk; segregated funds risk; and foreign exchange risk. As of December 31, 2016, Primerica Life Canada was in compliance with Canada\u2019s minimum capital requirements as determined by OSFI.\nFor more information regarding statutory capital requirements and dividend capacities of our insurance subsidiaries see Note 15 (Statutory Accounting and Dividend Restrictions) to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report for more information.\nRedundant Reserve Financings.\nThe Model Regulation entitled Valuation of Life Insurance Policies, commonly known as Regulation XXX, requires insurers to carry statutory policy benefit reserves for term life insurance policies with long-term premium guarantees which are often significantly in excess of the future policy benefit reserves that insurers deem necessary to satisfy claim obligations (\u201credundant policy benefit reserves\u201d). Accordingly, many insurance companies have sought ways to reduce their capital needs by financing redundant policy benefit reserves through bank financing, reinsurance arrangements and other financing transactions.\nWe have established Peach Re, Inc. (\"Peach Re\") and Vidalia Re as special purpose financial captive insurance companies and wholly owned subsidiaries of Primerica Life. Primerica Life has ceded certain term life policies issued prior to 2011 to Peach Re as part of a Regulation XXX redundant reserve financing transaction (the \u201cPeach Re Redundant Reserve Financing Transaction\u201d) and has ceded certain term life policies issued in 2011, 2012, 2013 and 2014 to Vidalia Re as part of a Regulation XXX redundant reserve financing transaction (the \u201cVidalia Re Redundant Reserve Financing Transaction\u201d). These redundant reserve financing transactions allow us to more efficiently manage and deploy our capital. The NAIC has adopted a model regulation for determining reserves using a principle-based approach (\u201cprinciple-based reserves\u201d or \u201cPBR\u201d), which is designed to reflect each insurer\u2019s own experience in calculating reserves and move away from a standardized reserving formula. PBR has been adopted by almost all state insurance departments effective in 2017, but has not yet been adopted by Massachusetts or New York, where two of our U.S. insurance subsidiaries are domiciled. If adopted, the new principle-based reserve regulation will greatly reduce the statutory policy benefit reserve requirements, but will only apply for business issued after the effective date.  We may explore expanding our existing redundant reserve financing transactions or establishing new transactions for business sold prior to the effective date of any principle-based reserve regulation. See Note 4 (Investments), Note 10 (Debt) and Note 16 (Commitments and Contingent Liabilities) to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report for more information on these redundant reserve financing transactions.\nNotes Payable.\nThe Company has $375.0 million of publicly-traded, Senior Notes outstanding issued at a price of 99.843% with an annual rate of 4.75%, payable semi-annually in arrears on January 15 and July 15. The Senior Notes mature July 15, 2022.\nWe were in compliance with the covenants of the Senior Notes at December 31, 2016. No events of default(s) occurred on the Senior Notes during the year ended December 31, 2016.\nFinancial Ratings.\nAs of December 31, 2016, the investment grade credit ratings for our Senior Notes were as follows.\nAgency\nSenior Notes rating\nMoody's\nBaa2, stable outlook\nStandard & Poor's\nA-, stable outlook\nA.M.

The Surplus Note has a principal amount equal to the LLC Note and is scheduled to mature on December 31, 2029. For more information on the Surplus Note, see Note 10 (Debt) to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements.\nOur off-balance sheet arrangements as of December 31, 2016 consisted of the letter of credit issued under the credit facility agreement with Deutsche Bank (the \u201cCredit Facility Agreement\u201d) and associated with the Peach Re Redundant Reserve Financing Transaction as described in Note 16 (Commitments and Contingent Liabilities) to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report.\nContractual Obligations.\nOur contractual obligations, including payments due by period, were as follows.\nDecember 31, 2016\nTotal\nLiability\nTotal\nPayments\nLess than\n1 year\n1-3\nyears\n3-5\nyears\nMore than\n5 years\n(In millions)\nFuture policy benefits\n$5,674\n$19,852\n$1,425\n$2,676\n$2,453\n$13,298\nPolicy claims and other benefits payable\n268\n268\n268\n-\n-\n-\nOther policyholder funds\n363\n363\n363\n-\n-\n-\nLong-term debt principal\n375\n375\n-\n-\n-\n375\nInterest obligations\n8\n186\n28\n57\n54\n47\nCommissions\n30\n30\n28\n2\n-\n-\nPurchase obligations\n4\n36\n22\n14\n1\n-\nOperating lease obligations\n-\n65\n7\n12\n11\n35\nCurrent income tax payable\n26\n26\n26\n-\n-\n-\nOther liabilities\n407\n397\n366\n28\n-\n2\nTotal contractual obligations\n$7,155\n$21,598\n$2,533\n$2,789\n$2,519\n$13,757\nOur liability for future policy benefits represents the present value of estimated future policy benefits to be paid, less the present value of estimated future net benefit premiums to be collected. Net benefit premiums represent the portion of gross premiums required to provide for all benefits and associated expenses. These benefit payments are contingent on policyholders continuing to renew their policies and make their premium payments. Our contractual obligations table discloses the impact of benefit payments that will be due assuming the underlying policy renewals and premium payments continue as expected in our actuarial models. The future policy benefit payments represented in the table are presented on an undiscounted basis, gross of any amounts recoverable through reinsurance agreements and gross of any premiums to be collected. We expect to fully fund the obligations for future policy benefits from cash flows from general account invested assets, claims reimbursed by reinsurers, and from future premiums. These estimations are based on mortality and lapse assumptions comparable with our historical experience. Due to the significance of the assumptions used, the amounts presented could materially differ from actual results.\nPolicy claims and other benefits payable represents claims and benefits currently owed to policyholders.\nOther policyholders\u2019 funds primarily represent claim payments left on deposit with us.\nLong-term debt principal relates to our Senior Notes.\nInterest obligations (reported within other liabilities in our consolidated balance sheets) reflect expected interest on our Senior Notes, the financing charges related to an issued letter of credit, fees paid for the credit enhancement feature on the LLC Note, and a finance charge incurred pursuant to one of our coinsurance agreements as of December 31, 2016. We did not include the principal or interest on the Surplus Note in the table above as the payments due for these items are contractually offset by the principal and interest on the LLC Note as long as we hold the LLC Note. The Company asserts its positive intent and ability to hold the LLC Note until maturity.\n56\nCommissions represent commissions that have been earned by our sales force but have not been paid as of December 31, 2016. We\nare only obligated to pay commissions as earned from sales of our products. The total liability amount is reported within other liabilities in our consolidated balance sheets.\nPurchase obligations include agreements to purchase goods or services that are enforceable and legally binding and that specify all significant terms. These obligations consist primarily of accounts payable and certain accrued liabilities, including committed funds related to meetings and conventions for our independent sales force, plus a variety of vendor commitments funding our ongoing business operations. The total liability amount is reported within other liabilities in our consolidated balance sheets.\nOur operating lease obligations primarily relate to office, warehouse, printing, and distribution properties. Our executive and home operations for all of our domestic U.S. operations (except New York) are located in Duluth, Georgia.\nOther liabilities are obligations reported within the consolidated balance sheets and consist primarily of amounts due under reinsurance agreements and general accruals and payables. The total payments within the table differ from the amounts presented in our consolidated balance sheets due to the exclusion of amounts where a reasonable estimate of the period of settlement cannot be determined.\nFor additional information concerning our commitments and contingencies, see Note 16 (Commitments and Contingent Liabilities) to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report.","5":"","6":"ITEM 7.\nMANAGEMENT\u2019S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.\nOverview\nWe are a leading supplier of structural assemblies, kits and components and design engineering services to the aerospace and defense markets.  We primarily sell our products and services to the large commercial, corporate and regional, and military aircraft markets.    We believe that OEMs and Tier 1 aerospace companies will continue the trend of selecting their suppliers based upon the breadth of more complex and sophisticated design and manufacturing capabilities and value-added services and the ability of their suppliers to manage large production programs.\nWe are organized into two reportable segments: the Aerostructures segment and the Engineering Services segment.  Our Aerostructures segment fabricates, machines, finishes, integrates, assembles and kits machined and formed close tolerance aluminum, specialty alloy, composite components and higher level assemblies for use by the aerospace and defense industries.  Our Engineering Services segment provides a complete range of design, engineering and program management services, supporting aircraft product lifecycles from conceptual design, analysis and certification through production support, fleet support, and service life extensions via a complete turnkey engineering solution.\nRecent Events\nOn February 16, 2017, the Company entered into a Merger Agreement with Sonaca S.A. relating to the proposed acquisition of the Company.  The Merger Agreement provides that each outstanding share of common stock of the Company will cease to be outstanding at the effective time of the merger and will be converted into the right to receive $14.00 in cash, without interest and subject to any applicable tax withholding.  Shareholders of the Company will be asked to vote on the approval of the Merger Agreement at a special shareholders\u2019 meeting that will be held on a date to be announced.\nIn the second quarter of 2016, a triggering event occurred when the Company significantly downgraded the full-year 2016 sales and operating income forecast for its Engineering Services business due to continued decline in demand.  This downward adjustment to the forecast, combined with lower than expected operating results for the second quarter of 2016, was deemed to be a triggering event requiring an interim impairment evaluation for the Engineering Services reporting unit in accordance with ASC 350.  An impairment analysis was performed and determined that the carrying value of related goodwill and intangible assets exceeded its fair value.  As a result, a non-cash impairment charge of\n$28.4 million\nwas recorded in the second quarter of 2016.   (See Item 7, Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations,\"Critical Accounting Estimates.\")\nDuring the fourth quarter of 2014, the Company performed its annual impairment testing of the Engineering Services segment which resulted in a\n$26.4 million\ngoodwill impairment charge.  (See Item 7, Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations,\"Critical Accounting Estimates.\")\nOn June 19, 2014, the Company issued $250.0 million in second-priority senior secured notes maturing on July 15, 2019.  Obligations under these notes are secured by substantially all of the Company\u2019s assets and bear interest at 7.375%, paid semi-annually in January and July, which commenced in January of 2015.  Also, on June 19, 2014, the Company used the proceeds from the issuance of these notes to settle and terminate its existing term loan and also modified its revolving credit agreement.  As a result, unamortized debt issuance costs associated with the agreement of $8.3 million were written off and recognized as interest expense.  Additional debt issuance costs of $8.3 million were incurred as a result of these transactions and are being amortized over the term of the notes and revolving credit agreement.\nIn January 2015, the Company entered into a long-term supply agreement with Spirit covering all Boeing, Airbus, Bombardier and Mitsubishi aircraft.  This agreement extended the performance period of the statements of work for certain contracts and gives the Company preferred supplier status on certain future contracts.  In accordance with the contract terms, the Company made $6.5 million in cash payments of consideration to Spirit in 2015.\nResults of Operations\nThe following table illustrates the percentage of sales to primary industries and markets realized over the last three years.\n35\nTable of Contents\nMarket\n2016\n2015\n2014\nLarge commercial aircraft\n57.0%\n52.9%\n50.1%\nCorporate and regional aircraft\n23.2%\n26.0%\n26.1%\nMilitary\n13.2%\n13.4%\n15.1%\nOther (1)\n6.6%\n7.7%\n8.7%\nTotal\n100.0%\n100.0%\n100.0%\n(1)  Includes technology, testing, rail yard switching equipment and various other products.\nYear ended\nDecember 31, 2016\ncompared to year ended\nDecember 31, 2015\nThe following table provides the comparative data for\n2016\nand\n2015\n.\n2016\nAerostructures\nEngineering\nServices\nElimination\nTotal\n($ in millions)\nNet sales\n$311.1\n$36.3\n$(1.2\n)\n$346.2\nCost of sales\n254.4\n32.9\n(0.9\n)\n286.4\nGross profit\n56.7\n3.4\n(0.3\n)\n59.8\nS, G, & A and other charges (1)\n40.6\n33.5\n\u2014\n74.1\nIncome (loss) from operations\n$16.1\n$(30.1\n)\n$(0.3\n)\n$(14.3\n)\n(1) Includes\n$28.4 million\nin the Engineering Services segment related to goodwill and intangible asset impairment.\n2015\nAerostructures\nEngineering\nServices\nElimination\nTotal\n($ in millions)\nNet sales\n$327.2\n$49.1\n$(1.2\n)\n$375.1\nCost of sales\n263.6\n43.8\n(1.1\n)\n306.3\nGross profit\n63.6\n5.3\n(0.1\n)\n68.8\nS, G, & A and other charges\n39.6\n8.4\n\u2014\n48.0\nIncome (loss) from operations\n$24.0\n$(3.1\n)\n$(0.1\n)\n$20.8\nAerostructures Segment\nNet Sales.\nNet sales were\n$311.1 million\nin\n2016\n,\na decrease\nof\n4.9%\nfrom\n$327.2 million\nin\n2015\n.

The most significant increase in revenue in the category was attributable to sales on the Bombardier C-Series platform, which generated revenues of $8.3 million in 2016 compared to $1.3 million in 2015.  In addition, sales attributable to increased\n36\nTable of Contents\ncontent and higher production rates on the Boeing 787 platform and sales of wing modification products increased $4.0 million and $3.7 million, respectively, to $31.5 million and $12.7 million, respectively, in 2016.  These increases were partially offset by decreases on the Boeing 747 platform, which generated revenue of $5.5 million in 2016 compared to $11.7 million in 2015.  In accordance with Boeing's announced deliveries on the 737 program, we expect our sales to increase on this platform in 2017.\nNet sales of components for corporate and regional aircraft were\n$70.3 million\nduring\n2016\ncompared to\n$84.7 million\nin\n2015\n,\na decrease\nof\n17.0%\n.  Revenues to this market were unfavorably impacted in 2016 by the wind down of mature programs in advance of the start up of developing programs.  The decrease in revenue was primarily attributable to overall sales on the Gulfstream G450\/G550 and tooling on the G500\/600 programs, which generated sales of $12.5 million and $8.9 million, respectively, in 2016 compared to $24.3 million and $12.7 million, respectively, in 2015.  We expect sales on the G450\/G550 program to continue to decline in 2017.\nMilitary products generated net sales of\n$36.0 million\nin\n2016\ncompared to\n$39.2 million\nin\n2015\n,\na decrease\nof\n8.2%\n.  The decrease is primarily due to reductions in revenue on the Lockheed Martin F-35 and the Boeing F-18 programs of $1.3 million and $1.2 million, respectively, from $2.3 million and $3.8 million, respectively, in 2015 to $1.0 million and $2.6 million, respectively, in 2016.\nOther products generated net sales of\n$20.3 million\nin\n2016\ncompared to\n$27.1 million\nin\n2015\n,\na decrease\nof\n25.1%\n.  The decrease is primarily due to a $2.9 million reduction in processing revenue from $6.1 million in 2015 to $3.2 million in 2016.\nCost of Goods Sold.\nCost of goods sold for\n2016\nwas\n$254.4 million\n(\n81.8%\nof net sales) compared to\n$263.6 million\n(\n80.6%\nof net sales) for\n2015\n.  The reduction in cost of goods sold in 2016 was primarily attributable to lower sales volumes, a reduction in incentive compensation expense of $1.5 million and the benefits of lower manufacturing overhead expenses realized from cost savings initiatives implemented in prior periods.  The increase in cost of goods sold as a percentage of sales in 2016 was primarily due to unfavorable fixed-cost utilization on lower sales volumes.\nCost of goods sold for the Aerostructures segment consists primarily of direct labor, materials, subcontract costs and manufacturing overhead, including indirect labor costs, depreciation, rent, supplies and other indirect costs.\nGross Profit.\nGross profit for\n2016\nwas\n$56.7 million\n(\n18.2%\nof net sales) compared to\n$63.6 million\n(\n19.4%\nof net sales) for\n2015\n.  Unfavorable product mix and the impact of lower sales contributed to the reduction in gross profit margin in 2016.  This decline in gross profit margin was partially offset by benefits realized from restructuring and cost savings activities completed during 2015 in addition to lower incentive compensation costs of $1.5 million.\nSelling, General and Administrative Expenses and Other Charges\n.  Selling, general and administrative expenses and other charges were\n$40.6 million\n(\n13.1%\nof net sales) in\n2016\ncompared to\n$39.6 million\n(\n12.1%\nof net sales) in\n2015\n.  The change in selling, general and administrative expenses primarily relates to a $3.3 million net gain recorded in 2015 related to the settlement of a lawsuit.  Excluding the impact of the lawsuit settlement, selling, general and administrative expenses and other charges declined $2.3 million in 2016 when compared to 2015.  Salary and related expenses and depreciation expense were lower in 2016 by $3.2 million and $0.8 million, respectively, when compared to 2015.  Professional fees increased $1.2 million in 2016 when compared to 2015 primarily related to an enterprise resource planning system project.\nSelling, general and administrative expenses for Aerostructures segment consists primarily of labor, rent, depreciation and amortization, professional services and other administrative expenses.\nEngineering Services Segment\nNet Sales.\nNet sales were\n$36.3 million\nin\n2016\n,\na decrease\nof\n26.1%\nfrom\n$49.1 million\nin\n2015.\nThe following table summarizes the segment\u2019s total sales and the percentage of the segment\u2019s total sales represented by the market served for each of the years ended\nDecember 31, 2016\nand\nDecember 31, 2015\n, respectively.\n37\nTable of Contents\nCategory\n2016% of Total\n2015% of Total\n($ in millions)\nLarge commercial aircraft\n$12.9\n35.5%\n$22.4\n45.6%\nCorporate and regional aircraft\n10.7\n29.5%\n13.4\n27.3%\nMilitary\n9.8\n27.0%\n11.1\n22.6%\nOther\n2.9\n8.0%\n2.2\n4.5%\nTotal\n$36.3\n100.0%\n$49.1\n100.0%\nNet sales of services for large commercial aircraft were\n$12.9 million\nin\n2016\ncompared to\n$22.4 million\nin\n2015\n,\na decrease\nof\n42.4%\n. The decrease in this category is partially attributable to a decline in sales related to maintenance and repair services, which contributed revenues of $11.1 million in 2016 compared to $15.6 million in 2015.  We believe this trend is likely to continue in 2017 due to OEM customer insourcing.  In addition, revenues on the Bombardier C-series and Boeing 747 programs decreased to $1.2 million and $0.0 million, respectively, in 2016 from $5.2 million and $0.5 million, respectively in 2015.\nNet sales of services supporting corporate and regional aircraft were\n$10.7 million\nduring\n2016\ncompared to\n$13.4 million\nin\n2015\n,\na decrease\nof\n20.1%\n. The decrease in this category was primarily attributable to the Aerion AS2 program, which contributed revenue of $0.7 million in 2016 compared to $2.9 million in 2015.  Sales on the Arrowhead Global Wing program contributed $1.1 million in 2015 and was completed in that year.  In 2016 and 2015, net unfavorable revenue adjustments were recognized of $1.3 million and $2.0 million, respectively, which were primarily related to the Mitsubishi Regional Jet program.\nMilitary programs generated net sales in\n2016\nof\n$9.8 million\ncompared to\n$11.1 million\nin\n2015\n,\na decrease\nof\n11.7%\n.  The Lockheed Martin HAVOC and the Bell V280 programs contributed revenues in 2015 of $1.3 million and $0.6 million, respectively.  These programs were completed in 2015.  In addition, sales on the Boeing F-18 and Embraer KC-390 programs decreased $0.8 million and $0.6 million, respectively, from $7.7 million and $0.7 million, respectively, in 2015 to $6.9 million and $0.1 million, respectively, in 2016.  These decreases in revenue were partially offset by an increase of $2.1 million on a new military trainer program.\nSales related to the design and delivery of tooling on various programs supporting commercial aircraft were\n$2.9 million\nin\n2016\ncompared to\n$2.2 million\nin\n2015\n,\nan increase\nof\n31.8%\n.  This increase is primarily related to tooling sales on Boeing programs.  We expect continued growth in tooling sales in 2017.\nCost of Goods Sold.\nCost of goods sold for\n2016\nwas\n$32.9 million\n(\n90.6%\nof net sales) compared to\n$43.8 million\n(\n89.2%\nof net sales) for\n2015.\nThe decrease in cost of goods sold was primarily due to reductions in direct labor, indirect labor and related fringe benefits of $9.5 million resulting from lower demand for this segment and cost reduction activities completed in 2015.\nCost of goods sold for the Engineering Services segment consists primarily of direct labor, subcontract costs and overhead, including rent, maintenance, and indirect costs.\nGross Profit.\nGross profit for this segment was\n$3.4 million\n(\n9.4%\nof net sales) for\n2016\ncompared to\n$5.3 million\n(\n10.8%\nof net sales) for\n2015\n.  The decrease in gross profit was primarily attributable to the decline in sales and related unfavorable fixed-cost utilization.  In 2016 and 2015, net unfavorable revenue adjustments were recognized of $1.3 million and $2.0 million, respectively, which were primarily related to the Mitsubishi Regional Jet program.\nSelling, General and Administrative Expenses and Other Charges.\nSelling, general and administrative expenses and other charges were\n$33.5 million\n(\n92.3%\nof net sales) in\n2016\ncompared to\n$8.4 million\n(\n17.1%\nof net sales) for\n2015\n.  The change in expense is primarily related to a $28.4 million goodwill and intangible asset impairment charge recognized in 2016.  Excluding the impairment expense, selling, general and administrative expenses and other charges declined $3.3 million in 2016 when compared to 2015.  Implemented cost reductions contributed to a decrease in salaries and related expense of $1.1 million in 2016 and restructuring charges of $1.2 million in 2015 did not recur in 2016.\nSelling, general and administrative expenses for Engineering Services segment consists primarily of labor, rent, depreciation and amortization, professional services and other administrative expenses.\nNon-segment Expenses\n38\nTable of Contents\nInterest Expense.\nInterest expense was\n$21.2\nmillion for\n2016\ncompared to\n$22.4\nmillion for\n2015\n, the result of overall lower outstanding borrowings and the retirement of $10.0 million of senior secured notes in the third quarter of 2016.\nOther Income (Expense), Net.\nOther\nexpense\nwas\n$0.4\nmillion for\n2016\ncompared to other\nexpense\nof\n$0.2\nmillion for\n2015.\nIncome Tax Expense.\nIncome tax benefit for\n2016\nwas\n$0.7\nmillion compared to a\n$0.4\nmillion income tax expense for\n2015\n.

In 2014, cost of goods sold was favorably impacted by the reversal of a loss reserve of $5.3 million on a long-term contract due to price increases received for engineering changes and improved hardware costs.  This reduction in cost of goods sold in 2014 was partially offset by accelerated depreciation of $1.3 million on assets disposed of at several facilities.\nCost of goods sold for the Aerostructures segment consists primarily of direct labor, materials, subcontract costs and manufacturing overhead, including indirect labor costs, depreciation, rent, supplies and other indirect costs.\nGross Profit.\nGross profit for\n2015\nwas\n$63.6\nmillion (\n19.4%\nof net sales) compared to\n$67.0\nmillion (\n20.6%\nof net sales) for\n2014\n.  Gross profit margin in 2014 was favorably impacted by the $5.3 million loss reserve reversal discussed above on a long-term contract which was partially offset by cost and inefficiencies related to restructuring activities.  Gross profit in 2015 was favorably impacted by realized cost savings related to restructuring plans implemented during 2014 and early 2015, offset by the impact of lower production levels.\nSelling, General and Administrative Expenses and Other Charges\n.

In addition, 2015 included a $2.0 million reduction in salary and related fringes when compared to 2014, the result of previously implemented cost reduction plans.\nSelling, general and administrative expenses for Aerostructures segment consists primarily of labor, rent, depreciation and amortization, professional services and other administrative expenses.\nEngineering Services Segment\nNet Sales.\nNet sales were\n$49.1\nmillion in\n2015\n,\na decrease\nof\n22.6%\nfrom\n$63.4\nmillion in\n2014.\nThe following table summarizes the segment\u2019s total sales and the percentage of the segment\u2019s total sales represented by the market served for each of the years ended\nDecember 31, 2015\nand\nDecember 31, 2014\n, respectively.\n40\nTable of Contents\nCategory\n2015% of Total\n2014% of Total\n($ in millions)\nLarge commercial aircraft\n$22.4\n45.6%\n$31.6\n49.8%\nCorporate and regional aircraft\n13.4\n27.3%\n13.8\n21.8%\nMilitary\n11.1\n22.6%\n10.1\n15.9%\nOther\n2.2\n4.5%\n7.9\n12.5%\nTotal\n$49.1\n100.0%\n$63.4\n100.0%\nNet sales of services for large commercial aircraft were\n$22.4 million\nin\n2015\ncompared to\n$31.6 million\nin\n2014\n,\na decrease\nof\n29.1%\n.  The decrease in this category was primarily attributable to a decline in sales related to the Airbus 350 platform which decreased from $5.2 million in 2014 to $0.2 million in 2015. In addition, sales on various Boeing programs, maintenance and repair revenues and sales on the Goodrich Nacelle program declined $1.4 million, $2.5 million and $1.3 million, respectively, in 2015 compared to 2014. These decreases were partially offset by an increase in revenue on the Bombardier C-Series program of $3.5 million, which contributed $5.4 million in 2015 compared to $1.9 million in 2014.\nNet sales of services supporting corporate and regional aircraft were\n$13.4 million\nduring\n2015\ncompared to\n$13.8 million\nin\n2014\n,\na decrease\nof\n2.9%\n.  The\ndecrease\nin sales is primarily attributable to a $7.9 million decrease in sales on the Bombardier Learjet L-85 program that was canceled in late 2014. This decrease was partially offset by an increase in sales on the Bombardier Global 7000 program, which contributed $5.6 million in 2015 compared to $4.4 million in 2014. In addition, sales increased on the Aerion AS2 and Arrowhead Global Wing program by $1.5 million and $1.1 million, respectively, when compared to the prior-year period.\nMilitary programs generated net sales in\n2015\nof\n$11.1 million\ncompared to\n$10.1 million\nin\n2014\n,\nan increase\nof\n9.9%\n.  The\ndecrease\nwas primarily attributable to sales on a program with the U.S. Navy of $7.7 million in 2015 compared to $6.2 million in 2014.  In addition, the Lockheed Martin HAVOC program, which was new in 2015, generated sales of $1.3 million.  These increases were partially offset by reductions on the Bell V-280 program of $2.2 million during 2015 when compared 2014.\nSales related to the design and delivery of tooling on various programs supporting commercial aircraft were\n$2.2 million\nin\n2015\ncompared to\n$7.9 million\nin\n2014\n,\na decrease\nof\n72.2%\n.

The decrease in cost of goods sold was primarily due to reductions in direct labor, which is the result of lower demand for this segment.\nCost of goods sold for the Engineering Services segment consists primarily of direct labor, subcontract costs and overhead, including rent, maintenance, and indirect costs.\nGross Profit.\nGross profit for this segment was\n$5.3\nmillion (\n10.8%\nof net sales) for\n2015\ncompared to\n$8.5\nmillion (\n13.4%\nof net sales) for\n2014\n.  The decrease in gross profit was primarily attributable to unfavorable cumulative long-term revenue adjustments in addition to the decline in sales and related unfavorable fixed-cost utilization.  In 2015 and 2014, net unfavorable revenue adjustments were recognized of $2.0 million and $1.0 million, respectively, which were primarily related to the Mitsubishi Regional Jet program.\nSelling, General and Administrative Expenses and Other Charges.\nSelling, general and administrative expenses and other charges were\n$8.4\nmillion (\n17.1%\nof net sales) in\n2015\ncompared to\n$36.2\nmillion (\n57.1%\nof net sales) for\n2014\n.  The change in expense in is primarily related to a $26.4 million goodwill impairment recognized in 2014.  In addition, implemented cost reductions contributed to a decrease in salaries and related expense by $1.5 million, which was partially offset by increases in restructuring expense of $0.7 million in 2015 when compared to 2014. Restructuring expenses recognized in 2015 related to the closure of the Greenville, South Carolina and Melbourne, Australia offices in addition to the elimination of other management positions within this segment.\nSelling, general and administrative expenses for Engineering Services segment consists primarily of labor, rent, depreciation and amortization, professional services and other administrative expenses.\n41\nTable of Contents\nNon-segment Expenses\nInterest Expense.\nInterest expense was\n$22.4 million\nfor\n2015\ncompared to\n$29.3 million\nfor\n2014\n.  On June 19, 2014, the Company terminated its previous long-term credit agreement, modified its revolving credit agreement, and issued senior notes. As a result of these transactions, interest expense in 2014 included $9.3 million related to the write-off of debt financing cost and settlement of related interest rate derivatives.  Excluding these non-recurring items. overall interest expense increased in 2015 when compared to 2014 as interest rates on our senior secured notes are higher than the rates under our previous credit agreement.\nOther Income (Expense), Net.\nOther\nexpense\nwas\n$0.2 million\nfor\n2015\ncompared to other\nincome\nof\n$0.2 million\nfor\n2014.\nIncome Tax Expense.\nIncome tax expense for\n2015\nwas\n$0.4 million\ncompared to an income tax benefit of\n$9.0 million\nin\n2014\n.    During 2015, our effective income tax rate was\n(18.6)%\ncompared to\n23.6%\nin 2014.  The effective tax rate in 2014 includes tax benefits of approximately $2.6 million associated with the decision to carry back the net operating loss recognized in 2013.\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures\nWhen viewed with our financial results prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (\u201cGAAP\u201d) and accompanying reconciliations, we believe earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (\"EBITDA\") and Adjusted EBITDA provide additional useful information to clarify and enhance the understanding of the factors and trends affecting our past performance and future prospects. We define these measures, explain how they are calculated and provide reconciliations of these measures to the most comparable GAAP measure in the tables below. EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA and the related financial ratios, as presented in this Form 10-K, are supplemental measures of our performance that are not required by, or presented in accordance with, GAAP.  They are not a measurement of our financial performance under GAAP and should not be considered as alternatives to net income or any other performance measures derived in accordance with GAAP, or as an alternative to net cash provided by operating activities as measures of our liquidity.  The presentation of these measures should not be interpreted to mean that our future results will be unaffected by unusual or nonrecurring items.\nWe use EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA non-GAAP operating performance measures internally as complementary financial measures to evaluate the performance and trends of our businesses.  We present EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA and the related financial ratios, as applicable, because we believe that measures such as these provide useful information with respect to our ability to meet our future debt service, capital expenditures, working capital requirements and overall operating performance.\nEBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA have limitations as analytical tools, and you should not consider them in isolation or as substitutes for analysis of our results as reported under GAAP.  Some of these limitations are.\n\u2022\nThey do not reflect our cash expenditures, future expenditures for capital expenditures or contractual commitments;\n\u2022\nThey do not reflect changes in, or cash requirements for, our working capital needs;\n\u2022\nThey do not reflect the significant interest expense or the cash requirements necessary to service interest or principal payments on our debt;\n\u2022\nAlthough depreciation and amortization are non-cash charges, the assets being depreciated and amortized will often have to be replaced in the future, and EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA do not reflect any cash requirements for such replacements;\n\u2022\nThey are not adjusted for all non-cash income or expense items that are reflected in our statement of cash flows;\n\u2022\nThey do not reflect the impact on earnings of charges resulting from matters unrelated to our ongoing operations; and\n\u2022\nOther companies in our industry may calculate EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA differently, limiting their usefulness as comparative measures.\nBecause of these limitations, EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA and the related financial ratios should not be considered as measures of discretionary cash available to us to invest in the growth of our business or as a measure of cash that will be available to us to meet our obligations.  You should compensate for these limitations by relying primarily on our GAAP results and use\n42\nTable of Contents\nEBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA only as a supplement to this information.  See our consolidated financial statements contained in this Report.\nHowever, in spite of the above limitations, we believe that EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA are useful to an investor in evaluating our results of operations because these measures.\n\u2022\nAre widely used by investors to measure a company\u2019s operating performance without regard to items excluded from the calculation of such terms, which can vary substantially from company to company depending upon accounting methods and book value of assets, capital structure and the method by which assets were acquired, among other factors;\n\u2022\nHelp investors evaluate and compare the results of our operations from period to period by removing the effect of our capital structure from our operating performance; and\n\u2022\nAre used by our management team for various other purposes in presentations to our Board of Directors as a basis for strategic planning and forecasting.\nNet loss in 2016 included charges for goodwill and intangible asset impairment, restructuring, integration expenses and the write-off of deferred financing costs.  Net loss in 2015 included charges for restructuring and integration expenses, the write-off of deferred financing costs and a gain related to the settlement of a lawsuit.  Net loss in 2014 included charges for goodwill impairment, restructuring, and integration expenses and the write-off of deferred financing costs.  EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA exclude these charges, as applicable, and provide meaningful information about the operating performance of our businesses apart from interest and tax expenses.\nThe following financial items have been added back to our net income when calculating EBITDA.\n\u2022\nDepreciation;\n\u2022\nAmortization expense;\n\u2022\nGoodwill and intangible asset impairment;\n\u2022\nInterest expense; and\n\u2022\nIncome tax expense.\nThe following financial items have been added back to our net income when calculating Adjusted EBITDA.\n\u2022\nStock-based compensation;\n\u2022\nIntegration expenses;\n\u2022\nRestructuring expenses;\n\u2022\nGains related to the settlement of a lawsuit; and\n\u2022\nOther (net).\n43\nTable of Contents\nFor the years ended\nDecember 31, 2016\n,\n2015\nand\n2014\n, the reconciliations of net loss to EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA were as follows.\n(In Thousands)\nYears Ended December 31,\n2016\n2015\n2014\nNet loss\n$(35,107\n)\n$(2,241\n)\n$(28,962\n)\nDepreciation and amortization (1)\n19,043\n20,404\n22,459\nGoodwill and intangible asset impairment (2)\n28,368\n\u2014\n26,439\nInterest expense (3)\n21,171\n22,439\n29,280\nIncome tax (benefit) expense (4)\n(734\n)\n352\n(8,953\n)\nEBITDA\n32,741\n40,954\n40,263\nStock-based compensation (5)\n2,932\n3,236\n2,748\nRestructuring expense (6)\n1,212\n2,322\n2,585\nIntegration expense\n295\n526\n818\nOther (net) (7)\n595\n(1,619\n)\n1,173\nAdjusted EBITDA\n$37,775\n$45,419\n$47,587\n(1)\nIncludes amortization of intangibles and depreciation expense.  2016 and 2015 also include amortization of consideration paid under a long-term supply agreement.\n(2)\nIn 2016, a triggering event occurred which resulted in the impairment of the goodwill and intangible assets in the Engineering Services reporting unit of $28,368.  In 2014, the annual impairment test conducted by the Company resulted in an impairment of goodwill associated with the Engineering Services segment of $26,439.\n(3)\nIncludes the write-off of deferred financing costs in connection with retirement of senior secured notes of $156 and $215 in 2016 and 2015, respectively.  Includes the write-off of deferred financing costs in connection with refinanced credit facilities in 2014 of $8,340.\n(4)\nIncludes $8,931 of income tax benefits generated from income tax losses for 2013 and 2014 that the Company decided in 2014 to carry back to prior years.\n(5)  2016 includes shared-based expense associated with the LMI Aerospace, Inc. 2005 Long-term Incentive Plan, the LMI Profit Sharing and Savings Plan, and the LMI Aerospace, Inc. 2015 Long-term Incentive Plan.  2015 includes shared-based expense associated with the LMI Aerospace, Inc. 2005 Long-term Incentive Plan, the LMI Profit Sharing and Savings Plan, the LMI Aerospace, Inc. 2015 Long-term Incentive Plan and the Valent Aerostructures, LLC 401(k) Plan.  2014 includes share-based expense associated with the LMI Aerospace, Inc. 2005 Long-term Incentive Plan and the LMI Profit Sharing and Savings Plan.   2015 and 2014 also include expenses associated with share-based payments to settle obligations under a consulting agreement.\n(6)\nIn 2016, restructuring includes costs associated with the relocation of the Wichita, KS sheet metal fabrication operation  in addition to other employment separation activities.  In 2015, restructuring includes costs associated with the closure of the St. Charles, MO machining operation, Coweta, OK manufacturing facility, and engineering offices in Melbourne, Australia and Greenville, SC, in addition to other employment separation activities.  In 2014, restructuring includes costs associated with the Precise Machine facility closure, Savannah, GA machining operations relocation, St. Charles, MO machining operations closure, and other employment separation activities.\n(7)  In 2015, the Company recorded a net gain of $3.3 million related to a legal settlement.  The gain realized from the settlement offsets environmental expenses, accelerated depreciation and other expenses totaling $1.9 million that were recorded as a favorable adjustment to EBITDA when incurred in prior periods.  For consistency, the above table reflects only $1.9 million of the net gain recorded in 2015 as an unfavorable EBITDA adjustment.  Includes $1.0 million of environmental expenses in 2014.\n44\nTable of Contents\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nThe Company's operations\ngenerated\ncash of\n$14.6 million\nin\n2016\n.  The Company's operations\ngenerated\ncash of\n$32.4 million\nin\n2015\nand\ngenerated\ncash of\n$49.1 million\nin\n2014\n.  The net operating cash inflow in 2016 was driven by an increase in accounts payable of $13.4 million primarily related to increasing inventory levels to support production ramp ups on key programs and extending payment terms with our vendors.\nThe net operating cash inflow in 2015 was driven by reductions in product inventory, the collection of $7.0 million in income tax receivables and a $3.1 million net cash legal settlement.\nIn January of 2015, the Company signed an agreement with Spirit to form a strategically aligned partnership.  This agreement extended the performance period of the statements of work for certain contracts with Spirit and gave the Company preferred supplier status on certain future contracts.  In accordance with the contract terms, the Company made $6.5 million in cash payments of consideration to Spirit in 2015.  Offsetting this increase and excluding the impact of inventory deferrals on long-term contracts, the Company reduced product inventory by $10.8 million in 2015.\nIn 2015, the Company and the former equity owners of Valent executed definitive settlement documents with respect to the resolution of certain indemnification claims and other disputes involving, among other things, the environmental matters associated with our Cuba, MO facility.  Pursuant to the terms of the agreements, $3.1 million of the funds held in escrow related to the acquisition of Valent were disbursed to the Company and the former equity owners of Valent assumed a $1.2 million payment obligation of the Company.  The settlement also resulted in the Company assuming other liabilities of $0.5 million, collecting a previously recorded receivable of $0.4 million and recording other expenses of $0.1 million.\nThe net operating cash inflow in 2014 was primarily driven by reductions in accounts receivable, increases in accrued expenses and overall operational performance.  Accounts receivable were favorably impacted by the collection of a $13.5 million milestone payment on the KC-390 program in 2014 for which sales were recognized in 2013.  Accrued expenses were favorably impacted by $9.7 million related to debt refinancing that occurred in 2014 and the related change in the timing of interest payments from monthly to semi-annually.  The first interest payment under the primary new debt facility, the amount of which was $10.3 million, was paid in January of 2015.\nNet cash\nused\nfor investing activities for the year ended\nDecember 31, 2016\nwas\n$11.2 million\ncompared to\n$16.3 million\nand\n$13.1 million\nfor the years ended\nDecember 31, 2015\nand\n2014\n, respectively.  We spent\n$11.8 million\nin\n2016\non capital expenditures, compared to\n$16.6 million\nand\n$16.7 million\nduring\n2015\nand\n2014\n, respectively, as we normalized capital spending after increasing capital spending in support of anticipated growth and the additional capital needs for our acquired businesses.  In 2017, we expect higher levels of capital spending to support planned production ramp-ups.\nCash\nused\nby financing activities was\n$11.4 million\nin\n2016\n,\n$13.5\nmillion in\n2015\nand\n$29.7\nmillion in\n2014\n.  In 2016, the Company used cash to pay $12.7 million in outstanding debt, of which $10.0 million was used to retire second-priority senior secured notes (the \"notes\").  In 2015, the Company used cash to pay $13.3 million in outstanding debt, of which $10.8 million was used to retire outstanding notes.  During 2014, the Company settled its then outstanding term loan with proceeds from the issuance of $250.0 million in notes.  Proceeds from the notes also partially funded net payments of $36.0 million\nagainst our revolving credit facility.  The Company also settled a mortgage of $2.1 million, an equipment loan of $3.1 million and retired $5.0 million of the outstanding notes during 2014.  The Company paid\n$8.0 million\nin debt financing costs in 2014.\nCash paid for interest was\n$18.7 million\nin 2016 compared to\n$21.3 million\nin 2015 and\n$7.4 million\nin 2014.  The decrease in interest paid in 2016 when compared to 2015 is primarily due to the retirement of notes in 2016 and in the second half of 2015.  Through June 18, 2014, the Company's primary debt was a term loan that accrued interest at a rate of 4.75%.    During the second half of 2014 and throughout 2015 and 2016, the Company's primary debt was notes accruing interest at a rate of 7.375%, which did not require interest payments until January of 2015.\nOn June 19, 2014, the Company issued $250.0 million in notes maturing on July 15, 2019, of which $224.2 million remain outstanding at December 31, 2016. Also on June 19, 2014, the Company modified its existing revolving credit facility which matures on the earlier of the fifth year anniversary date, July 15, 2019, or the date that is 91 days prior to the maturity date of the notes unless the notes are repaid, refinanced or otherwise satisfied in full.  The maturity dates are subject to acceleration upon occurrence of an event of default.  An event of default under the revolving credit agreement includes, among other things, failure to pay any material indebtedness, acceleration of payments by any lender prior to scheduled maturity, or judgments rendered against the Company requiring payments at or above certain levels.  The credit agreement contains a covenant that requires us to comply with a maximum first priority debt to EBITDA ratio on a quarterly basis.  In addition, the agreement also contains certain restrictive covenants that limit and in some circumstances prohibit, our ability to, among other things, incur additional debt, sell,\n45\nTable of Contents\nlease or transfer our assets, make investments, guarantee debt or obligations, create liens, and enter into certain merger, consolidation or other reorganization transactions.  These restrictive covenants prohibit the Company from paying dividends.  These restrictions could limit our ability to obtain future financing, make acquisitions or needed capital expenditures, withstand the current or future downturns in our business or the economy in general, conduct operations or otherwise take advantage of business opportunities that may arise, any of which could place us at a competitive disadvantage relative to our competitors that have less debt and are not subject to such restrictions.  At\nDecember 31, 2016\n, the Company was in compliance with all of its covenants and expects to be in compliance with its covenants in future periods.  If the Company fails to meet any covenants in the credit facility, the Company would not be in compliance with its credit agreement and the lenders would be entitled to exercise various rights, including causing the amounts outstanding under the revolving credit facility to become immediately due and payable.\nThe Company expects to meet its ongoing working capital, debt service, and capital expenditure needs presently and for the next twelve months from a combination of cash on hand, cash flow from operating activities and cash available under our revolving credit facility.\nThe Company, in the ordinary course of business, evaluates strategies to enhance our results of operations, financial position, or liquidity.  These strategies may include acquisitions, divestitures, opportunities to reduce costs or increase revenues, and other strategic initiatives to increase stockholder value.  We are unable to predict which, if any, of these initiatives will be executed.  The execution of these initiatives may have a material impact on our future results of operations, financial position, or liquidity.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nOur off-balance sheet arrangements consist primarily of operating leases as reflected under \u201cContractual Obligations and Commitments\u201d below.\nContractual Obligations and Commitments\nWe had the following contractual obligations and commitments for debt and non-cancelable operating lease payments.\nTotal\nLess Than\n1 year\n1-3 years\n3 - 5 years\nMore\nthan\n5 years\n($ in thousands)\nDebt (1)\n$243,301\n$2,603\n$230,373\n$8,707\n$1,618\nInterest on Long-term debt (2)\n$42,966\n17,158\n25,233\n344\n231\nOperating Leases\n$40,769\n7,636\n13,127\n9,761\n10,245\nPurchase commitments\n$2,754\n541\n2,213\n\u2014\n\u2014\nTotal\n$329,790\n$27,938\n$270,946\n$18,812\n$12,094\n(1)\nIncludes obligations under capital leases\n(2)\nInterest expense based on balances of long-term debt at the end of the period and current effective interest rate.\n46\nTable of Contents\nCritical Accounting Estimates\nCertain accounting issues require management estimates and judgments for the preparation of financial statements.  We believe that the estimates, assumptions and judgments involved in the accounting policies described below have the greatest potential impact on our financial statements.  Therefore, we consider these to be our critical accounting estimates.  Our management has discussed the development and selection of these critical accounting estimates with the Audit Committee of our Board of Directors, and the Audit Committee has reviewed our disclosure relating to these estimates.  However, these methods, assumptions and estimates could create materially different results under different conditions or using different assumptions.\nInventory.\nExcept for inventories related to long-term contracts accounted for under contract accounting as discussed below, we value our product inventories at the lower of cost or market using actual cost for raw materials and average or standard cost (which approximates actual cost) for work in process, manufactured and purchased components and finished goods.  In assessing the ultimate realization of inventories, we make judgments as to future demand requirements based upon customer orders in backlog, historical customer orders, customer and industry analyst estimates of aircraft production rates, and other market data available to us.  Additionally, in the aviation industry, these future demand requirements depend on estimates of aircraft lives and the need for spare parts over the course of the aircraft life.  Charges are recorded when product lines are discontinued, customer contracts are lost, order activity declines, or future requirements change.\nWe sell many of our products under fixed-price arrangements.  Occasionally, costs of production may exceed the market values of certain products and product families, which require us to adjust our inventory value.  In these circumstances, management is required to make estimates of costs not yet incurred to determine the ultimate cost of these products that are in work in process.  Changes in the assumptions and estimates of such factors as expected scrap, costs of material, labor and outside services and the amount of labor required to complete the products may result in changes in inventory value.\nAt times, we accept orders for products where actual production costs differ from our expectations when we quoted the product.  Additionally, customers may request engineering changes or quality acceptance changes in products that may alter the cost of products produced by us.  In the latter circumstance, we notify the customer of these issues and seek reimbursement for costs incurred to satisfy these requested changes on delivered units, as well as an adjustment to the selling price for future deliveries.\nFor certain fixed price contracts requiring development or delivery of multiple units of complex product over more than one year, we incur and defer, as part of the inventory, certain costs that are specific to a particular contract and which we expect to recoup as part of the unit cost charged to the customer under the contract.  At December 31, 2016, these deferrals include $5.4 million for consideration paid related to an agreement signed with Spirit Aerostructures that is being amortized to as a reduction to sales over the life of the related contracts.  See  Item 8, Note 4 - \"Inventories\" in the Notes to our Consolidated Financial Statements.   Deferred costs in inventory are charged to cost of product sales ratably as the manufactured units are shipped or costs are incurred pursuant to the contract.  Changes in the estimated number of units expected to be delivered under the contracts result in prospective adjustments of the ratable charge-off of deferred inventoriable costs per unit shipped.  Should the remaining inventoriable costs plus estimated costs of production of units yet to be shipped under the contract exceed estimated future contract revenues, any resulting loss is recognized in the period it becomes probable and estimable.  See Note 1 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 below.\nRevenue and Profit Recognition.\nExcept as described below, the Company recognizes revenue for sales of products and related services in accordance with Financial Accounting Standards Board, (\u201cFASB\u201d) Accounting Standards Codification (\u201cASC\u201d) Topic 605-15 Products and Topic 605-20 Services.  The Company sells products under long-term supply contracts and purchase orders where the product is built to customer specifications and on firm purchase orders from the customer.   Purchase orders tend to be of a relatively short duration and customers place orders on a periodic basis.  Pricing is generally fixed for a length of time and quantities are based on individual purchase orders. Revenue is recognized when title passes and services are rendered, the price is fixed or determinable and collection is reasonably assured.   Approximately 80-90% of the total revenue the Company recognizes in any given quarter is accounted for in accordance with Topics 15 and 20.   The remainder of revenue is accounted for using percentage of completion accounting methods consistent with the ASC Topic 605-35 Construction -Type and Production-Type Contracts.\nThe percentage of completion method used to account for contracts depends on the nature of the products provided under the contract.  For example, for contracts that require us to perform a significant level of development effort, in comparison to the total value of the contract, sales are recorded using the cost-to-cost method to measure progress toward completion.  Under the cost-to-cost method of accounting, we recognize sales and estimated profit as costs are incurred based on the proportion that the incurred costs represent of total estimated costs.  For contracts that require us to provide a substantial number of similar items without a significant level of development, we record sales and estimated profit using units of delivery as the basis to measure\n47\nTable of Contents\nprogress toward completing the contract.  Under both methods, profit recognized is based on the total expected profit margin percentage multiplied by revenue recognized to date.\nThe Company periodically reviews all estimates to complete as required by the authoritative guidance and the estimated total cost and expected gross profit are revised, as appropriate, over the life of the contract.  Any revisions to estimated total cost are accounted for as a change in estimate.  A cumulative catch-up adjustment is recorded in the period the change in estimated cost to complete the contract is determined.  Gross profit in a period that reflects a change in estimate will include (a) a cumulative catch-up adjustment which reflects the adjustment of previously recognized profit associated with all prior period revenue recognized based on the current estimate of gross profit margin, as appropriate, and (b) recognition of the current period costs of sales and related gross profit margin based on the current period sales multiplied by the current estimate of the gross profit margin on the contract.\nShould total estimated costs at completion exceed the estimated total revenue, the anticipated full loss on a contract is recognized in the period in which the anticipated loss is determined.  The loss is reported as either a reduction of revenue or as a charge to cost of sales.   The cumulative gross profit margin recognized on a contract accounted for under the units of delivery method through the end of the current period on a contract with an estimated loss will equal the current estimate of the gross profit margin on the contract multiplied by the contract revenues recognized through the end of the current period plus the provision for the additional loss on contract revenues yet to be recognized.  The current period cost of sales on a contract with a loss reserve will equal current period sales, thus, gross profit on those sales will be recognized at a 0% margin.  In accordance with ASC 605-35-45-1&2, the provisions for anticipated losses on contracts are accounted for as additional contract cost and recognized as part of cost of sales.  Provisions for losses are recorded as a reduction of related contract costs recorded in inventory.  Any excess loss provision is recorded as a current liability.\nIn 2016 and 2015, the Company recognized unfavorable cumulative catch-up adjustments of $1.9 million and $2.8 million, respectively, related to the Mitsubishi Regional Jet design-build program.  In 2015, a provision for anticipated loss was established on this contract.\nThe net favorable cumulative catch-up adjustment recorded in 2014 is primarily due to a contract for which a provision for anticipated loss was established in 2013 for $5.3 million as part of the purchase accounting for the Valent acquisition.  During 2014, this contract was amended due to the resolution of several engineering changes that resulted in increased revenue per shipset.  In addition, the Company was able to secure more favorable future material costs as engineering design to the related assemblies had stabilized.  As a result, contract costs were no longer expected to exceed revenue and the related loss reserve was reversed in 2014.  The Company also recorded an unfavorable cumulative catch-up adjustment on the Mitsubishi Regional Jet design-build program in 2014 that resulted in a reduction in revenue of $1.5 million.  The Company did not have any contracts in a loss contract position at December 31, 2014.\nFor contracts accounted for using the percentage of completion method, management\u2019s estimates of total units to be produced, and material, labor and overhead costs on long-term contracts are critical to the Company.  Due to the size, length of time and nature of many of our contracts, the estimation of revenue and costs through completion is complicated and subject to many variables.\nTotal contract revenue estimates are based on negotiated contract prices, customer change orders, claims (when a legal basis exists) and estimated cost to produce the product or service plus a profit in some instances.  The contract revenue estimates consider customer purchase orders, projections and industry guidance. In addition, claims and unpriced change orders will impact the estimate of total revenues and profits.  In the ordinary course of business, the Company may receive requests from its customers to perform tasks not specified in its contracts.  When this occurs on a long-term contract using the cost-to-cost method of percentage of completion accounting, the Company may record revenue for claims or unpriced change orders to be negotiated with customers.  As of\nDecember 31, 2016\n, approximately\n0.3%\nof revenue represented amounts associated with claims and unpriced change orders.\nTotal contract cost estimates are primarily based on our current cost of production, purchase order terms negotiated or estimated by our supply chain.  These costs include negotiated or estimated material costs, historical labor performance trends, business base and other economic projections. Factors that influence these estimates include inflationary trends, technical and schedule risk, performance trends, asset utilization, and anticipated labor rates.\nThe development of contract revenue and gross margin percentages involve utilization of detailed procedures by a team of operational and financial personnel that provide information on the status of the contracts.  Estimates of each significant contract\u2019s revenue and cost are reviewed and approved by the team on a quarterly basis.  Any approved changes in these estimates are analyzed to determine if they result in recognition of cumulative adjustments to contract profits in the period in which changes are made.\n48\nTable of Contents\nDue to the significance of judgment in the estimation process described above, it is possible that materially different margins could be recorded if different assumptions were used or if underlying circumstances change.  Changes in underlying assumptions, estimates or circumstances may adversely or positively affect financial performance in future periods.\nGoodwill and Intangible Assets.\nGoodwill is not amortized; rather, it is tested annually in accordance with FASB ASC Topic 350, Intangibles-Goodwill and Other (\u201cASC 350\u201d).  The Company exercises its judgment in evaluating its goodwill and intangible assets for possible impairment.  The Company performs goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible asset impairment testing annually in the fourth quarter of each fiscal year as well as whenever events or changes in circumstances during the fiscal year indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable.  The Company evaluates whether any triggering events have occurred during the fiscal year, such as a significant decrease in expected cash flows at a reporting unit or changes in market or other business conditions that may indicate a potential impairment of goodwill or other intangible assets.\nThe Company has the option to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying amount.  If it is, the quantitative tests require comparing recorded values to estimated fair values for the assets under review.  If it is not, no additional analysis is required, however the Company may choose to perform a quantitative assessment of the fair value.\nThe Company's goodwill balances were\n$62.5\nmillion and\n$86.8\nmillion at\nDecember 31, 2016\nand\n2015\nrespectively.  Under guidelines established by FASB ASC Topic 280, Segment Reporting (\u201cASC 280\u201d) the Company operates in two operating segments.  However, the Company has recorded its goodwill and conducts testing for potential goodwill impairment at a reporting unit level.   The reporting units represent a business for which discrete financial information is available, and segment management regularly reviews the operating results.\nIn 2016, the Company reorganized the management and organizational structure of the Aerostructures operating segment into two reporting units that combine like manufacturing products and processes.  Aerostructures impairment testing was conducted at November 30, 2016 based on these new reporting units defined as Assembly and Machining (\"A&M\") and Fabrication and Composites (\"F&C\").  The make-up of these reporting units is not significantly different from those reported in prior periods. Aerostructures impairment testing conducted in 2015 was based on the previously defined reporting units of Valent and Fabrication.  The restructuring of reporting units in 2016 involved reassigning some manufacturing facilities previously part of the Fabrication reporting unit and combining them with all of the Valent entities to comprise the A&M reporting unit.  The Company assessed whether any of the Fabrication goodwill should be moved to A&M, and based on the relative fair values of the sites involved, no goodwill was reassigned.\nGoodwill at December 31, 2016 was\n$62.5 million\n, all of which was reported within the Aerostructures operating segment. The majority of this balance, $56.3 million, was related to the acquisition of Valent and was assigned in the A&M reporting unit, with the remainder assigned to the F&C reporting unit. During 2016, as discussed further below, a triggering event occurred which deemed that the goodwill previously reported in the Engineering Services reporting unit was fully impaired.\nA quantitative test of the fair values of goodwill and indefinite lived intangibles was conducted for all of the Company's reporting units in 2016. The fair values for goodwill testing are estimated using a combination of the income and market approach unless circumstances indicate that a better estimate of fair value is available.  The income approach utilizes the discounted cash flow model (\u201cDCF model\u201d) and the market approach is based on the market data for a group of guideline companies.\nUsing the DCF model requires the Company to forecast operating cash flows, including future sales growth, operating costs,  tax rates, capital spending,  and working capital changes. These assumptions may vary significantly among the reporting units. In addition estimates are required for the discount rate and the terminal value.  The discount rate represents the expected return on capital and is based on the estimated weighted average cost of capital for a market participant.  The discount rate considers the risk inherent in the projections used to estimate the fair value of the reporting unit.  This rate takes into account the uncertainty about the expected revenue growth of the reporting unit and expected operating margins as well as the past performance of the reporting unit.  The cash flow forecasts of the reporting units are based upon management\u2019s long-term view of the Company\u2019s markets.  The Company has not materially changed its methodology for goodwill impairment testing for the years presented.   Due to the many variables inherent in the estimation of a reporting unit's fair value and the relative size of the Company's recorded goodwill, differences in assumptions may have a material effect on the results of the Company's impairment analysis.\nThe Company also used the market approach to estimate the fair value of the reporting unit.  The Company utilizes the guideline public company method in which valuation pricing multiples are derived from the market share prices of stocks of companies that are engaged in the same or similar lines of business as the reporting unit, and that are actively traded on a free and open market.  The derived multiples are then applied to the reporting unit\u2019s financial metrics producing indications of value, which are correlated to reach a final indication of value.\n2016 Impairment Analysis\nEngineering Services Reporting unit.\nIn the second quarter of 2016, a triggering event occurred when the Company significantly downgraded the full-year 2016 sales and operating income forecast for its Engineering Services business due to\n49\nTable of Contents\ncontinued decline in demand.  This downward adjustment to the forecast, combined with lower than expected operating results for the second quarter of 2016, was deemed to be a triggering event requiring an interim impairment evaluation for the Engineering Services reporting unit in accordance with ASC 350.  An impairment analysis was performed and determined that the carrying value of related goodwill was fully impaired.  As a result, a non-cash impairment charge of\n$24,302\nwas recorded in the second quarter of 2016, which brought the goodwill associated with the reporting unit to\n$0.\n\u2022\nDiscount rate:  The discount rate used in determining the fair value of the reporting unit was 15.4% which was higher than rate of 12.2% used in 2015. The discount rate increase in 2016 was primarily due to the historical earnings volatility of the unit in the last three fiscal periods.\n\u2022\nRevenue growth assumptions:  Projected annual growth assumptions are based on the Company\u2019s and its peers historical operating performance adjusted for current and expected competitive and economic factors surrounding the aerospace and defense industry (the \u201cindustry\u201d).  The growth rates used approximated 2.5% per year.  The Company used a terminal growth rate of 2.0% to calculate the terminal value in the discounted cash flow analysis.\n\u2022\nOperating profit margin assumptions:  The forecasted operating profit used in the income approach is expected to decline in the future years as sales growth would not offset inflation.\n\u2022\nWorking Capital assumptions and capital expenditures:  Working capital requirements were forecasted based on the reporting unit\u2019s historical performance.  Capital expenditures were forecasted based on current spending plans for the forecast period and are expected to moderate as sales growth slows in the terminal year.\nThe Company also used the market approach to estimate the fair value of the reporting unit.  The Company used an EBITDA multiple based on the next 12 months of 3.0 and revenue multiples of 0.1 to estimate fair value using a market approach.\nAssembly and Machining reporting unit.\nThe Company's 2016 annual step one impairment test did not indicate that the fair value of this reporting unit was below its carrying value.  The fair value exceeded the book value by 6.2% at the testing date.  The key assumptions used in the step one test are as follows.\n\u2022\nDiscount rate:  The discount rate used in determining the fair value of the reporting unit was 11.5%.  The the discount rate reflects the use of corporate bond yield rates for securities with a debt rating similar to that of the Company's senior secured notes at December 31, 2016.  This corporate bond yield rate was used in the calculation of the risk-free rate.  Any  discount rate below 12.25% would indicate that the fair value of the reporting unit remains in excess of the carrying value of the unit.\n\u2022\nRevenue growth assumptions:  Projected annual growth assumptions are based on the Company and its peers historical operating performance adjusted for current and expected competitive and economic factors surrounding the aerospace and defense industry (the \u201cindustry\u201d).  The growth rate used for the reporting unit approximated 9.9% per year primarily driven by expected increased demand for large commercial aircraft.  The Company used a terminal growth rate of 3.0% to calculate the terminal value in the discounted cash flow analysis.\n\u2022\nOperating profit margin assumptions:  The forecasted operating profit used in the income approach is expected to improve in the future years as a result of leveraging additional sales.\n\u2022\nWorking Capital assumptions and capital expenditures:  Working capital requirements were forecasted based on the reporting unit\u2019s historical performance.  Capital expenditures were forecasted based on current spending plans for the forecast period and are expected to moderate as sales growth slows in the terminal year.\nThe Company also used the market approach to estimate the fair value of the reporting unit.  The Company used EBITDA multiples based on the last 12 months, the next 24 months and a 3 year average historical average to estimate fair value using a market approach.  The multiple used in the valuation was approximately 9.4 times EBITDA.  This resulted in a market value that was within 6.1% of the estimated fair value using the income approach.  If any of these or other related estimates and assumptions are not realized in the future, to the extent the reporting unit cannot generate future cash flows at a level sufficient to recover the net book value, the Company may be required to record impairment charges.  The impairment charges would reduce future net income and earnings per share.\nFabrication and Composites reporting unit.\nThe Company's 2016 annual step one impairment test did not indicate that the fair value of this reporting unit was below its carrying value.  The fair value exceeded the book value by 50.5% at the testing date.  The key assumptions used in the step one test are as follows.\n\u2022\nDiscount rate:  The discount rate used in determining the fair value of the reporting unit was 12.5%.  The discount rate reflects the use of corporate bond yield rates for securities with a debt rating similar to that of the Company's senior secured notes at December 31, 2016.  This corporate bond yield rate was used in the calculation of the risk-free rate.\n\u2022\nRevenue growth assumptions:  Projected annual growth assumptions are based on the Company and its peers historical operating performance adjusted for current and expected competitive and economic factors surrounding the aerospace and defense industry (the \u201cindustry\u201d).  The growth rate used for the reporting unit approximated 8.6% per year primarily\n50\nTable of Contents\ndriven by expected increased demand for large commercial aircraft.  The Company used a terminal growth rate of 3.0% to calculate the terminal value in the discounted cash flow analysis.\n\u2022\nOperating profit margin assumptions:  The forecasted operating profit used in the income approach is expected to improve in the future years as a result of leveraging additional sales.\n\u2022\nWorking Capital assumptions and capital expenditures:  Working capital requirements were forecasted based on the reporting unit\u2019s historical performance.  Capital expenditures were forecasted based on current spending plans for the forecast period and are expected to moderate as sales growth slows in the terminal year.\nThe Company also used the market approach to estimate the fair value of the reporting unit.  The Company used EBITDA multiples based on the last 12 months, the next 24 months and a 3 year average historical average to estimate fair value using a market approach.  The multiple used in the valuation was approximately 7.6 times EBITDA.  This resulted in a market value that was within 7.5% of the estimated fair value using the income approach.  If any of these or other related estimates and assumptions are not realized in the future, to the extent the reporting unit cannot generate future cash flows at a level sufficient to recover the net book value, the Company may be required to record impairment charges.  The impairment charges would reduce future net income and earnings per share.\nAs of December 31, 2016, and in further support of our analysis, our net book value for the entire Company (i.e., shareholders\u2019 equity) was\n$85.5\nmillion, and our market capitalization was approximately $117.4 million.  Additionally, on February 16, 2017, the Company entered into a Plan of Merger with Sonaca S.A.  As part of this agreement, shareholders of the Company's common stock will receive $14.00 per share, which implies the estimated fair value of the outstanding equity of the Company is approximately $190.8 million.  This excess of implied fair value supports the Company's conclusion that there is no impairment of goodwill at December 31, 2016.\n2015 Impairment Analysis\nEngineering Services Reporting unit.\nThe Company's 2015 annual step one impairment test indicated that the fair value of this reporting unit exceeded its book value by 8.4% at the testing date.  The key assumptions used in the step one test were as follows.\n\u2022\nDiscount rate:  The discount rate used in determining the fair value of the reporting unit was 12.2% which was higher than rate of 11.7% used in 2014. The discount rate increase in 2015 was primarily due to the historical earnings volatility of the unit in the last three fiscal periods.\n\u2022\nRevenue growth assumptions:  Projected annual growth assumptions are based on the Company\u2019s and its peers historical operating performance adjusted for current and expected competitive and economic factors surrounding the aerospace and defense industry (the \u201cindustry\u201d).  The growth rates used approximated 4.1% per year.  The Company used a terminal growth rate of 3.0% to calculate the terminal value in the discounted cash flow analysis.\n\u2022\nOperating profit margin assumptions:  The forecasted operating profit used in the income approach is expected to improve in the future years as a result of sales growth and a reduction in operating costs resulting from restructuring activities completed in fiscal year 2015.\n\u2022\nWorking Capital assumptions and capital expenditures:  Working capital requirements were forecasted based on the reporting unit\u2019s historical performance.  Capital expenditures were forecasted based on current spending plans for the forecast period and are expected to moderate as sales growth slows in the terminal year.\nThe Company also used the market approach to estimate the fair value of the reporting unit.  The Company used EBITDA multiples based on the last 12 months and for the next 12 months to estimate fair value using a market approach.  The multiple used in the valuation was approximately 7.1 times EBITDA.  This resulted in a market value that was within 1.8% of the estimated fair value using the income approach.\nValent Reporting unit.\nThe Company's 2015 annual step one impairment test did not indicate that the fair value of this reporting unit was below its carrying value.  The fair value exceeded the book value by 17.3% at the testing date.  The key assumptions used in the Step One test were as follows.\n\u2022\nDiscount rate:  The discount rate used in determining the fair value of the reporting unit was 12.0% which was slightly higher than rate of 11.5% used in 2014. The increase in the discount rate reflects the use of corporate bond yield rates for securities with a debt rating similar to that of the Company's senior secured notes at December 31, 2015.  This corporate bond yield rate was used in the calculation of the risk-free rate.\n\u2022\nRevenue growth assumptions:  Projected annual growth assumptions are based on the Company\u2019s and its peers historical operating performance adjusted for current and expected competitive and economic factors surrounding the aerospace and defense industry (the \u201cindustry\u201d).  The growth rates used approximated 8.1% per year primarily driven by expected\n51\nTable of Contents\nincreased demand for large commercial aircraft.  The Company used a terminal growth rate of 3.0% to calculate the terminal value in the discounted cash flow analysis.\n\u2022\nOperating profit margin assumptions:  The forecasted operating profit used in the income approach is expected to improve in the future years as a result of leveraging additional sales.\n\u2022\nWorking Capital assumptions and capital expenditures:  Working capital requirements were forecasted based on the reporting unit\u2019s historical performance.  Capital expenditures were forecasted based on current spending plans for the forecast period and are expected to moderate as sales growth slows in the terminal year.\nThe Company also used the market approach to estimate the fair value of the reporting unit.  The Company used EBITDA multiples based on the last 12 months and for the next 12 months to estimate fair value using a market approach.  The multiple used in the valuation was approximately 8.7 times EBITDA.  This resulted in a market value that was within 4.3% of the estimated fair value using the income approach.\nFabrication Reporting Unit.\nThe Company performed the annual test of goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets for the Fabrication unit by performing a qualitative assessment and concluded it was more likely than not that the fair value of the unit exceeded carrying value, and thus no impairment charge was recorded.\nOther Intangibles\n. Other intangible assets on the Consolidated Balance Sheets were\n$38.9 million\nand\n$46.6 million\n, at\nDecember 31, 2016\nand\n2015\n, respectively. Customer-related intangible assets resulted from the acquisitions of Versaform Corporation, Intec, TASS and Valent had original estimated useful lives ranging from five to twenty-two years. Other intangible assets resulting from the acquisition of Intec and Valent had an original estimated useful life of three to six years.  The assumptions and judgments used in determining the useful lives of the intangible assets included in the period of time over which the Company expects to use the asset, expected duration of revenue that will be generated from the asset and how relationships with customers will create future propensity to purchase products and services from the Company.  Valent intangible assets are amortized using the straight-line method.  All other remaining intangibles assets are not material.\nWe test intangible assets for impairment by assessing the current period cash flows of each asset group.  Events or changes in circumstances, including loss of a significant customer, a significant decrease in the level of business with a customer or a long-term contract not being extended, would indicate that the carrying amount of any of these intangible assets may not be recoverable and a change in the remaining useful life could be required.  If that is the case, an undiscounted cash flow test is performed and, if necessary, an impairment charge is recognized for the amount by which the carrying amount of these assets exceeds its fair value. Intangible assets relating to the Engineering Services reporting unit were tested during the 2016 Step Two impairment test, as discussed above, and were deemed to be impaired at June 30, 2016, resulting in a charge of $4.1 million.\nThe remaining intangible assets were evaluated for triggering events quarterly by the Company in 2016 and were not deemed to be impaired.\nIncome Taxes.\nThe objective of accounting for income taxes is to recognize the amount of taxes payable or refundable for the current year and deferred tax liabilities and assets based on the future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in our financial statements or tax returns. Deferred tax assets are also required to be reduced by a valuation allowance if it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax asset will not be realized.\nWe record an income tax expense or benefit based on the net income earned or net loss incurred in each tax jurisdiction and the tax rate applicable to that income or loss. In the ordinary course of business, there are transactions for which the ultimate tax outcome is uncertain. The final tax outcome for these matters may be different from management\u2019s original estimates made in determining the income tax provision. A change to these estimates could impact the effective tax rate and net income or loss subsequent periods.\nA valuation allowance, if needed, reduces deferred tax assets to the amount expected to be realized. When determining the amount of net deferred tax assets that are more likely than not to be realized, management assesses all available positive and negative evidence. This evidence includes, but is not limited to, prior earnings history, expected future earnings, carry-back and carry-forward periods and the feasibility of ongoing tax strategies that could potentially enhance the likelihood of the realization of a deferred tax asset.  The weight given to the positive and negative evidence is commensurate with the extent the evidence may be objectively verified.  As such, it is generally difficult for positive evidence regarding projected future taxable income exclusive of reversing taxable temporary differences to outweigh objective negative evidence of recent financial reporting losses.\nBased on these criteria and the relative weighting of both the positive and negative evidence available, and in particular the activity surrounding the Company's losses in 2016, 2015 and 2014, management determined that it was necessary to establish a valuation allowance against all of its net U.S. deferred tax assets at December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014.  This determination was made as the Company entered into a cumulative loss position in the year ended December 31, 2013, due to the recording of a goodwill impairment of $73.5 million related to Valent.  The Company remains in a loss position at December 31, 2016.  Once the Company entered into a cumulative loss position, it passed the threshold after which there is a presumption that it should no longer rely solely on projected future income when determining whether the deferred tax asset is more likely than not to be realized.\n52\nTable of Contents\nWhile the Company does project future income, the objectively verifiable negative evidence of the recent losses and risk related to those projections outweighs the positive evidence.  The remaining valuation allowance, which fully reserves the U.S. net deferred tax asset, was\n$21.0 million\n,\n$14.6 million\nand\n$12.7 million\nat December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively.\nThe Company will continue to monitor its deferred tax position and may adjust the valuation allowance, if necessary, for utilization of the underlying deferred tax assets through current taxable income or as available evidence changes.\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\nFor information related to recently issued accounting standards, see Note 1 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 below.","7":"","8":"","9":"","10":"ITEM 7.

In light of these risks and uncertainties, there can be no assurance that the forward-looking\nstatements contained in this Report will in fact occur as projected.\nLiquidity\nand Capital Resources\nCurrent\nand Planned Operations\nCurrently,\nthe Company has to travel to and from its only office in North Dakota to the mid-west to bid and compete for sales. The Company\nhopes to expand operations by opening a satellite office in the mid-western region whereby we could aggressively bid on projects\neasier and more efficiently. The Company also plans to mitigate the uncertainty of the U.S. economy by increasing its customer\nbase to include mid-sized grocery chains as well.\nThe\nlarge national supermarket chains usually remodel their stores every (4) four to (6) six years. The Company has noticed that national\nchains will more typically begin remodeling projects in the second half of the year, with completion before the holiday season.\nThe majority of the Company\u2019s revenues are derived from Super Valu, Inc or Associated Wholesale Grocers which are 2 of many\ninterior grocery store de\u0301cor design companies. The contracts we are awarded can be anywhere from 1 week to 1 month, depending\non how large the store is. It normally takes 21-30 days upon completion of projects to be paid in full.\nExpanding\nthe Company\u2019s market reach and physical presence is the key to its continued growth. Because current ADM staff is limited\nby geographic considerations when bidding for jobs, it is necessary to provide more staff in more regions. Below is a list of\nplanned district offices for the company and the geographical areas they will serve. Through the Company\u2019s efforts to go\npublic and enter the equities markets, the Company is seeking to secure additional funds from outside investors to execute its\nplanned expanded operations in the near future. The Company has not entered into any agreements, verbal or written, with regards\nto securing additional funding necessary to finance planned future operations. Moreover, there are no agreements in place with\nany officer of the Company nor with outside entities to fund the Company if it were to have a shortfall in capital. It is estimated\nthat each of the Company\u2019s five targeted expansion areas will require approximately $200,000 each in startup capital for\na total of $1,000,000 over a two-year rollout period.\nBismarck,\nNorth Dakota will continue to remain the headquarters for the Company. Because approximately 80% of the Company\u2019s current\nclients come from the Kansas City area, this is the first area targeted for expansion.\nDistrict\nLocation\nGeographic\nArea\nTarget\nDate\nKansas\nCity, MO\nMissouri,\nKansas, Oklahoma, Arkansas\nMarch\n1, 2018\nMinneapolis,\nMN\nMinnesota,\nIowa, Wisconsin, Northern Illinois, and the UP of Michigan\nSeptember\n1, 2018\nDenver,\nCO\nColorado,\nWyoming, Western Nebraska, and Western Kansas\nMarch\n1, 2019\nChicago,\nIL\nIllinois,\nIndiana, Michigan, and Eastern Wisconsin\nSeptember\n1, 2019\nSpokane,\nWA\nWashington,\nCalifornia, Idaho, and Montana\nMarch\n1, 2020\n10\nThe\nCompany hopes this expansion will result in large revenue gains over the next three years. As each new location becomes self-sufficient,\nrevenues will grow proportionately. In order to ensure each location is self-sufficient as quickly as possible, the Company will\nimplement an expansion plan company wide, including the following practices.\n\u25cf\nA\nfull technological update, which will include the installation of a computer network with its main server located in Bismarck,\nNorth Dakota. Each outlying location will have a computer station so as to centralize each location. The headquarters will\ncontinue to be responsible for all accounting, billing, tracking, administrative, and management activities. Each location\nwill simply provide data inputs of current activity to keep data current at all times.\nResults\nof Operations for the Years Ended December 31, 2015 and 2014\nCritical\nAccounting Policies\nUse\nof estimates\nThe\npreparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates\nand assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities\nat the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Accordingly,\nactual results could differ from those estimates. Such estimates include management\u2019s assessments of the carrying value\nof certain assets, useful lives of assets, and related depreciation and amortization methods applied.\nRevenue\nRecognition\nThe\nCompany recognizes revenue when it is realized or realizable and earned. The Company considers revenue realized or realizable\nand earned when all of the following criteria are met: (i) persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, (ii) the product has\nbeen shipped or the services have been rendered to the customer, (iii) the sales price is fixed or determinable, and (iv) collectability\nis reasonably assured. In addition, the Company records allowances for accounts receivable that are estimated to not be collected.\nPrinciples\nof Consolidation\nThe\naccompanying consolidated financial statements include all of the accounts of the Company and its wholly-owned subsidiary ADM\nEnterprises, LLC. All intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated.\nProperty\nand Equipment\nProperty\nand equipment are recorded at cost. Expenditures for major additions and betterments are capitalized. Maintenance and repairs\nare charged to operations as incurred. Depreciation is computed by the straight-line method over the assets estimated useful life\nof three (3) years for equipment, (5) years for automobile, and (7) years for furniture and fixtures. Upon sale or retirement\nof property and equipment, the related cost and accumulated depreciation are removed from the accounts and any gain or loss is\nreflected in statements of operations.\nQuantitative\nand Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk\nWe\nconduct all of our transactions, including those with foreign suppliers and customers, in U.S. dollars. We are therefore not directly\nsubject to the risks of foreign currency fluctuations and do not hedge or otherwise deal in currency instruments in an attempt\nto minimize such risks. Demand from foreign customers and the ability or willingness of foreign suppliers to perform their obligations\nto us may be affected by the relative change in value of such customer or supplier\u2019s domestic currency to the value of the\nU.S. dollar. Furthermore, changes in the relative value of the U.S. dollar may change the price of our products relative to the\nprices of our foreign competitors.\nStock-Based\nCompensation\nWe\nrecognize compensation cost for stock-based awards based on the estimated fair value of the award on date of grant. We measure\ncompensation cost at the grant date based on the fair value of the award and recognize compensation cost upon the probable attainment\nof a specified performance condition or over a service period.\n11\nRecently\nIssued Accounting Pronouncements\nWe\nhave decided to take advantage of the exemptions provided to emerging growth companies under the JOBS Act and as a result our\nfinancial statements may not be comparable to companies that comply with public company effective dates. We may take advantage\nof exemptions from various reporting requirements that are applicable to other public companies that are not emerging growth companies,\nincluding not being required to comply with the auditor attestation requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, delay\ncompliance with new or revised accounting standards that have different effective dates for public and private companies until\nthey are made applicable to private companies.\nCompany\nmanagement does not believe that any other recently issued, but not yet effective accounting pronouncements, if adopted, would\nhave a material effect on the accompanying financial statements.\nOff-Balance\nSheet Transactions\nWe\ncurrently have no off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future material effect\non our financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures\nor capital resources.","11":"ITEM 7\nMANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS\nOF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nCautionary Statement Identifying Important\nFactors That Could Cause FREIT\u2019s Actual Results to Differ From Those Projected in Forward Looking Statements.\nReaders of this discussion are advised\nthat the discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements of FREIT (including related notes\nthereto) appearing elsewhere in this Form 10-K. Certain statements in this discussion may constitute \u201cforward-looking statements\u201d\nwithin the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Forward-looking statements reflect FREIT\u2019s current\nexpectations regarding future results of operations, economic performance, financial condition and achievements of FREIT, and do\nnot relate strictly to historical or current facts. FREIT has tried, wherever possible, to identify these forward-looking statements\nby using words such as \u201cbelieve,\u201d \u201cexpect,\u201d \u201canticipate,\u201d \u201cintend, \u201c \u201cplan,\u201d\n\u201c estimate,\u201d or words of similar meaning.\nAlthough FREIT believes that the expectations\nreflected in such forward-looking statements are based on reasonable assumptions, such statements are subject to risks and uncertainties,\nwhich may cause the actual results to differ materially from those projected. Such factors include, but are not limited to the\nfollowing: general economic and business conditions, which will, among other things, affect demand for rental space, the availability\nof prospective tenants, lease rents, the financial condition of tenants and the default rate on leases, operating and administrative\nexpenses and the availability of financing; adverse changes in FREIT\u2019s real estate markets, including, among other things,\ncompetition with other real estate owners, competition confronted by tenants at FREIT\u2019s commercial properties, governmental\nactions and initiatives; environmental\/safety requirements; and risks of real estate development and acquisitions. The risks with\nrespect to the development of real estate include: increased construction costs, inability to obtain construction financing, or\nunfavorable terms of financing that may be available, unforeseen construction delays and the failure to complete construction within\nbudget.\nOVERVIEW\nFREIT is an equity real estate investment\ntrust (\"REIT\") that is self-administered and externally managed. FREIT owns a portfolio of residential apartment and\ncommercial properties. FREIT\u2019s revenues consist primarily of rental income and other related revenues from its residential\nand commercial properties and additional rent in the form of expense reimbursements derived from operating commercial properties.\nFREIT\u2019s properties are primarily located in northern New Jersey, Maryland and New York. FREIT acquires existing properties\nfor investment and properties that FREIT believes have redevelopment potential through changes and capital improvements to these\nproperties. FREIT develops and constructs properties on its vacant land. FREIT\u2019s policy is to acquire and develop real property\nfor long-term investment.\nThe economic and financial environment.\nThe U.S. economy grew throughout the year reaching an average annualized rate of 3.2% in the third quarter of calendar 2016 which\nis the highest growth rate in almost two years. Employment remains healthy and real income grew at a solid pace. This positive\ntrend should continue to impact favorably on the housing market and consumer spending and continue to raise the growth rate of\nthe U.S. economy. This rising growth rate may trigger the Federal Reserve to raise lending rates that may affect refinancing of\nmortgages coming due in the short term.\nResidential Properties.\nFREIT has aggressively increased rental rates. As a result, FREIT\u2019s rental rates continue to show year-over-year increases.\nFREIT expects increases in rental rates to taper; however, the increased rental rates that are in place should positively impact\nfuture revenues.\nCommercial Properties.\nWhile retail sales were tepid during the first quarter of calendar 2016, they rebounded in the latter part of the year increasing\nto 4.3% by the end of third quarter of calendar 2016. Real consumption growth is expected to continue to rebound over the next\ncouple of years.\nDevelopment Projects and Capital\nExpenditures.\nFREIT continues to make only those capital expenditures that are absolutely necessary. The construction at\nthe Rotunda development project began in September 2013 and, with the exception of tenant improvements, was substantially completed\nin the third quarter of Fiscal 2016 with costs to complete estimated at $1 million. As of October 31, 2016, the residential section\nis approximately 29% leased and the retail space is approximately 71% leased. FREIT expects the Rotunda to generate positive cash\nflow in the latter half of fiscal year 2017.\nDebt Financing Availability.\nFinancing for development projects has been available to FREIT and its affiliates. On December 9, 2013, Grande Rotunda, LLC closed\nwith Wells Fargo Bank on a construction loan of up to $120 million to be used to redevelop and expand the Rotunda property in Baltimore,\nMaryland with a term of four (4) years, with one 12-month extension, at a rate of 225 basis points over the monthly LIBOR. As of\nOctober 31, 2016, approximately $114 million of this loan was drawn down (including approximately $21.1 million during Fiscal 2016),\nof which $19 million was used to pay off the loan from FREIT, and $95 million was used toward the construction at the Rotunda.\nOn November 23, 2016, Wells Fargo Bank modified the following terms and conditions of this loan: (i) the total amount that may\nbe drawn on this loan will be decreased from $120 million to $116.1 million, allowing for an additional draw of $2.1 million over\nthe existing balance of approximately $114 million to be used for retail tenant improvements and leasing commissions; (ii) leasing\nbenchmarks will no longer be required to be met including the waiver of the leasing benchmarks FREIT was not in compliance with\nas of June\n20\nTable of Contents\n30, 2016; (iii) Grande Rotunda, LLC will provide an interest reserve to Wells Fargo Bank in the amount of $2 million\nfor the purpose of funding interest payments, and will be obliged to replenish the account balance to $1 million if it should fall\nbelow $500,000; (iv) the maturity date of the loan was changed from December 31, 2017 to October 31, 2017 with no option to extend;\n(v) the interest rate on amount outstanding on the loan was increased by 25 basis points to 250 basis points over the monthly LIBOR.\nOn December 29, 2014, FREIT Regency,\nLLC closed on a $16.2 million mortgage loan with Provident Bank. The new loan bears a floating interest rate equal to 125 basis\npoints over the one-month BBA LIBOR and the loan will mature on December 15, 2024. In order to minimize interest rate volatility\nduring the term of this loan, FREIT Regency, LLC entered into an interest rate swap agreement that, in effect, converted the floating\ninterest rate to a fixed interest rate of 3.75% over the term of the loan.\nOn April 22, 2016, People\u2019s United\nBank agreed to a take-down of the second tranche of its loan with Damascus Centre, LLC in the amount of $2,320,000, of which approximately\n$470,000 was readily available and the remaining $1,850,000 (included in prepaid expenses and other assets in the accompanying\nconsolidated balance sheet) is held in escrow and available to Damascus Centre, LLC once certain tenants open and begin paying\nrent. In order to minimize interest rate volatility during the term of this loan, Damascus Centre, LLC entered into an interest\nrate swap agreement that, in effect, converted the floating interest rate to a fixed interest rate of 3.53% over the term of the\nsecond tranche of this loan.\nOn September 29, 2016, Wayne PSC, LLC\nrefinanced its $24.2 million mortgage loan held with Metropolitan Life Insurance Company, with a new mortgage loan from People\u2019s\nUnited Bank in the amount of $25.8 million. The new loan, secured by a shopping center in Wayne, New Jersey, bears a floating interest\nrate equal to 220 basis points over the one-month BBA LIBOR with a maturity date of October 1, 2026. In order to minimize interest\nrate volatility during the term of the loan, Wayne PSC, LLC entered into an interest rate swap agreement that, in effect, converted\nthe floating interest rate to a fixed interest rate of 3.625% over the term of the loan. This refinancing resulted in: (i) a reduction\nin interest rate from 6.04% to 3.625% and (ii) net refinancing proceeds of approximately $1 million that were distributed to the\npartners in Wayne PSC, LLC with FREIT receiving $0.4 million based on it 40% membership interest in Wayne PSC, LLC.\nOperating Cash Flow and Dividend\nDistributions.\nFREIT expects that cash provided by net operating income will be adequate to cover mandatory debt service\npayments (excluding balloon payments), necessary capital improvements and dividends necessary to retain qualification as a REIT\n(90% of taxable income). Until the economic climate indicates that a change is appropriate, it is FREIT\u2019s intention to maintain\nits quarterly dividend at a level not less than that required to maintain its REIT status for federal income tax purposes. See\nItem 5 \u201c\nDividends\n\u201d for further details.\nSIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES\nPursuant to the SEC disclosure guidance\nfor \"Critical Accounting Policies,\" the SEC defines Critical Accounting Policies as those that require the application\nof management's most difficult, subjective, or complex judgments, often because of the need to make estimates about the effect\nof matters that are inherently uncertain and may change in subsequent periods.\nOur discussion and analysis of our financial\ncondition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements, the preparation of which takes into account\nestimates based on judgments and assumptions that affect certain amounts and disclosures. Accordingly, actual results could differ\nfrom these estimates. The accounting policies and estimates used, which are outlined in Note 1 to our Consolidated Financial Statements\nwhich is presented elsewhere in this Form 10-K, have been applied consistently as at October 31, 2016 and October 31, 2015, and\nfor the years ended October 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014. We believe that the following accounting policies or estimates require the\napplication of management's most difficult, subjective, or complex judgments.\nRevenue Recognition: Base rents, additional\nrents based on tenants' sales volume and reimbursement of the tenants' share of certain operating expenses are generally recognized\nwhen due from tenants. The straight-line basis is used to recognize base rents under leases if they provide for varying rents over\nthe lease terms. Straight-line rents represent unbilled rents receivable to the extent straight-line rents exceed current rents\nbilled in accordance with lease agreements. Before FREIT can recognize revenue, it is required to assess, among other things, its\ncollectability. See \u201c\nResults of Operations \u2013 Segment Information \u2013 Commercial Segment\n\u201d under Item\n7 regarding the expense in the fourth quarter of Fiscal 2015 related to the Pathmark lease.\nValuation of Long-Lived Assets: We assess\nthe carrying value of long-lived assets periodically, or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying\namounts of certain assets may not be recoverable. When FREIT determines that the carrying value of long-lived assets may be impaired,\nthe measurement of any impairment is based on a projected discounted cash flow method determined by FREIT's management. While we\nbelieve that our discounted cash flow methods are reasonable, different assumptions regarding such cash flows may significantly\naffect the measurement of impairment.\nReal Estate Development Costs: It is\nFREIT\u2019s policy to capitalize pre-development costs, which generally include legal and professional fees and other directly\nrelated third-party costs. Real estate taxes and interest costs incurred during the development and construction phases are also\ncapitalized. FREIT ceases capitalization of these costs when the project or portion thereof\n21\nTable of Contents\nbecomes operational, or when construction\nhas been postponed. In the event of a postponement, capitalization of these costs will recommence once construction on the project\nresumes.\nSee Note 1 to FREIT\u2019s consolidated\nfinancial statements for recently issued accounting standards.\nResults of Operations.\nFiscal Years Ended October 31, 2016 and 2015\nSummary revenues and net income for the\nfiscal years ended October 31, 2016 (\u201cFiscal 2016\u201d) and October 31, 2015 (\u201cFiscal 2015\u201d) are as follows.\nYears Ended October 31,\n2016\n2015\nChange\n(in thousands, except per share amounts)\nReal estate revenues.\nCommercial properties\n$23,202\n$22,817\n$385\nResidential properties\n23,052\n21,966\n1,086\nTotal real estate revenues\n46,254\n44,783\n1,471\nOperating expenses.\nReal estate operations\n21,797\n21,062\n735\nStraight line rent adjustment - bankrupt tenant\n\u2014\n1,046\n(1,046\n)\nGeneral and administrative\n2,034\n2,029\n5\nDepreciation\n7,852\n6,883\n969\nTotal operating expenses\n31,683\n31,020\n663\nOperating income\n14,571\n13,763\n808\nInvestment income\n150\n150\n\u2014\nGain on sale of commercial property\n314\n\u2014\n314\nFinancing costs\n(11,936\n)\n(11,001\n)\n(935\n)\nNet income\n3,099\n2,912\n187\nNet income attributable to noncontrolling\ninterests in subsidiaries\n(94\n)\n(281\n)\n187\nNet income attributable to common equity\n$3,005\n$2,631\n$374\nEarnings per share - basic and diluted.\n$0.44\n$0.39\n$0.05\nWeighted average shares outstanding.\nBasic\n6,783\n6,778\nDiluted\n6,784\n6,778\nReal estate revenue for Fiscal 2016 increased\n3.3% to $46,254,000 compared to $44,783,000 for Fiscal 2015.

Included in net income-common equity for Fiscal 2016 was a net loss of approximately $1.4 million primarily attributed\nto the substantial completion of the major redevelopment and expansion project at the Rotunda property in the third quarter of\nFiscal 2016 resulting in the cessation of capitalization of certain costs and incurring higher operational costs as the property\nis in the early lease-up phase of the new retail space and residential units. Also included in net income-common equity for Fiscal\n2016 was a gain of approximately $0.3 million net of sales fees related to the sale of Rochelle Park, New Jersey. Included in\nnet income common equity for Fiscal 2015 was a $1,046,000 provision for loss related to straight line rent receivable for Pathmark\nat the Patchogue, New York store as a result of the bankruptcy filing by A&P, of which Pathmark is a subsidiary.

FREIT assesses and measures segment operating results\nbased on NOI.\nSame Property NOI: FREIT considers same\nproperty net operating income (\u201cSame Property NOI\u201d) to be a useful supplemental non-GAAP measure of its operating performance.\nFREIT defines same property within both the commercial and residential segments to be those properties that FREIT has owned and\noperated for both the current and prior periods presented, excluding those properties that FREIT acquired, redeveloped or classified\nas discontinued operations during those periods. Any newly acquired property that has been in operation for less than a year, any\nproperty that is undergoing a major redevelopment, but may still be in operation at less than full capacity, and\/or any property\nthat is under contract for sale are not considered same property.\nNOI and Same Property NOI are non-GAAP\nfinancial measures and are not measures of operating results or cash flow as measured by GAAP, and are not necessarily indicative\nof cash available to fund cash needs and should not be considered an alternative to cash flows as a measure of liquidity.\nCOMMERCIAL SEGMENT\nThe commercial segment contains nine\n(9) separate properties. Seven are multi-tenanted retail or office centers, and two are single tenanted \u2013 a building formerly\noccupied as a supermarket and land located in Rockaway, New Jersey owned by FREIT from which it receives monthly rental income\nfrom a tenant who has built and operates a bank branch on the land. On June 17, 2016, FREIT sold its property at Rochelle Park,\nNew Jersey having a carrying value of approximately $2.7 million (including a straight line rent receivable of approximately $0.5\nmillion) to Lakeland Bank (as successor by merger to Pascack Community Bank) for a purchase price of $3.1 million resulting in\na gain of approximately $0.3 million net of sales fees. This sale will result in FREIT\u2019s loss of future annual rents of approximately\n$241,000, which would have increased periodically through September 2023.\nAs indicated in the table above under\nthe caption Segment Information, total revenue and NOI from FREIT\u2019s commercial segment for Fiscal 2016 decreased by 1.5%\nand 4.5%, respectively, as compared to Fiscal 2015. The decline in revenue and NOI was primarily attributable to the loss of revenue\nfrom Pathmark (a subsidiary of A&P) at the Patchogue, New York\n24\nTable of Contents\nproperty due to the lease having been rejected as of December\n31, 2015 as a result of A&P\u2019s bankruptcy filing partially offset by an increase in revenue at the Rotunda property resulting\nfrom the lease-up of the new retail space.\nSame Property Operating Results: FREIT\u2019s\ncommercial segment contains eight (8) same properties. (See definition of same property under Segment Information above.) Since\nthe Rotunda property was part of a major redevelopment and expansion project that was substantially completed in the third quarter\nof Fiscal 2016 and has been in operation for less than a full year, it has been excluded from same property results for all periods\npresented. For Fiscal 2016, same property revenue and NOI for FREIT\u2019s commercial segment decreased by 6.2% and 6.5%, respectively,\nas compared to Fiscal 2015. The reasons for the changes mirror the discussion in the previous paragraph.\nLeasing: The following table reflects\nleasing activity at FREIT\u2019s commercial properties for comparable leases (leases executed for spaces in which there was a\ntenant at some point during the previous twelve-month period) and non-comparable leases for Fiscal 2016.\nRETAIL.\nNumber of\nLeases\nLease Area\n(Sq.

Average occupancy rates for Fiscal 2016, decreased 0.9% from\nlast year\u2019s comparable period which was primarily attributed to Pathmark\u2019s rejection of the lease at the Patchogue,\nNew York property as of December 31, 2016 offset by the increase in occupancy at the Rotunda property due to the substantial completion\nof the major development and expansion project in the third quarter of Fiscal 2016. Excluding the impact of the Rotunda property,\naverage occupancy rates for Fiscal 2016 decreased 2.6% from Fiscal 2015.\nFREIT is currently in the negotiation\nprocess with potential tenants for the new, currently available retail space constructed at the Rotunda property. As of October\n31, 2016, approximately 71% of the retail space at the Rotunda property is leased and 24.8% is occupied.\nOn July 27, 2012, FREIT signed a lease\nagreement with G-Mart, for a significant portion of the space (40,000 of 55,330 square feet of available space) that was vacated\nby Giant at its Westridge Square shopping center. G-Mart managed an international grocery store chain. FREIT incurred approximately\n$940,000 in tenant improvement costs associated with the lease to G-Mart, which began operations at the center in September 2013.\nHowever, effective November 1, 2014, G-Mart notified FREIT that it had vacated its space at the Westridge Square shopping center\nand would be terminating its lease. A new lease for this 40,000 sq. ft. space was signed by H-Mart, an international grocery store\nchain, in November 2014 and subsequently H-Mart expanded its space by an additional 15,300 square feet. H-Mart is currently renovating\nits space but began paying rent in May 2015. All of the tenant improvements related to G-Mart will be utilized for H-Mart.\nOn July 19, 2015, A&P filed for protection\nunder Chapter 11 of the bankruptcy code as disclosed in the bankruptcy filings. A&P announced its intention to sell its assets\nand wind up its affairs. FREIT owns a 63,932 square foot store in Patchogue, New York with a carrying value of approximately $6.7\nmillion as at October 31, 2016 that was leased to Pathmark, a subsidiary of A&P, and operated as a Pathmark Super Store. This\nlease was rejected by A&P as of December 31, 2015.\nIn accordance with GAAP, FREIT accounted\nfor rental income from the store using the straight line method and accrued rent evenly over the lease term after taking into account\nscheduled future rent increases, with excess rent accrued over amounts received accounted for as a receivable on the consolidated\nbalance sheets. At October 31, 2015, approximately $1,046,000 remained as a straight line rent receivable. FREIT recorded an expense\nin the fourth quarter of Fiscal 2015 of $1,046,000 ($0.15 per share basic and diluted) for provision for loss related to the straight\nline rent receivable for Pathmark. The provision had no impact on cash flow but did have an impact on funds from operations. As\na result of the lease having been rejected, FREIT is losing annual rents of approximately $1.4 million until the store is re-leased.\nFREIT has assessed the real\n25\nTable of Contents\nestate for impairment and determined that no impairment exists at October 31, 2016. FREIT is exploring\nvarious options for this property.\nOn January 11, 2016, FREIT was notified\nby Lakeland Bank (as successor by merger to Pascack Community Bank) of its election and exercise of the option to purchase the\nproperty leased by FREIT to Lakeland Bank located in Rochelle Park, New Jersey. Pursuant to the Lease Agreement, Lakeland Bank\nhad the right to exercise this option at a price equal to the greater of $3 million or the fair market value of the property as\ndetermined by mutual agreement between tenant and landlord. FREIT and Lakeland Bank agreed to a purchase price of $3.1 million.\nOn June 17, 2016, FREIT sold this property, having a carrying amount of approximately $2.7 million (including a straight-line rent\nreceivable in the amount of approximately $0.5 million), to Lakeland Bank for $3.1 million resulting in a gain of approximately\n$0.3 million net of sales fees. This sale results in FREIT\u2019s loss of future annual rents of approximately $241,000, which\nwould have increased periodically through September 2023. As the disposal of this property did not represent a strategic shift\nthat would have a major impact on FREIT\u2019s operations or financial results, the property\u2019s operations were not reflected\nas discontinued operations in the accompanying financial statements.\nDEVELOPMENT ACTIVITIES\nThe Rotunda property in Baltimore, Maryland\n(owned by FREIT\u2019s 60% owned affiliate Grande Rotunda, LLC) is an 11.5 acre site containing a building with approximately\n132,000 sq. ft. of office space and approximately 84,000 sq. ft. of retail space on the lower level of the building. In September\n2013, FREIT began construction to redevelop and expand this property and, with the exception of tenant improvements, was substantially\ncompleted in the third quarter of Fiscal 2016 with costs to complete estimated at $1 million. The redevelopment and expansion plans\nincluded a modernization of the office building and smaller adjacent buildings, construction of 379 residential apartment rental\nunits, an additional 75,000 square feet of new retail space, and 864 above level parking spaces. As of October 31, 2016, the residential\nsection is approximately 29% leased and the retail space is approximately 71% leased. FREIT expects the Rotunda to generate positive\ncash flow in the latter half of fiscal year 2017.\nWith regard to the Rotunda\u2019s redevelopment\nproject, approximately $128.1 million has been incurred through October 31, 2016, of which $3.7 million was written-off in Fiscal\n2012 as a result of revisions to the scope of the redevelopment project. All planning and feasibility study costs, as well as all\nongoing construction costs related to the project which were previously capitalized to Construction In Progress (\u201cCIP\u201d)\nare no longer being capitalized and have been placed into service in the fourth quarter of Fiscal 2016 as the project is now operational.\nOn December 9, 2013, Grande Rotunda, LLC closed with Wells Fargo Bank on a construction loan of up to $120 million to be used to\nredevelop and expand the Rotunda property in Baltimore, Maryland with a term of four (4) years, with one 12-month extension, at\na rate of 225 basis points over the monthly LIBOR. Through October 31, 2016, funding for the construction at the Rotunda was provided\nby: (a) the Grande Rotunda, LLC members, FREIT and Rotunda 100, LLC, who contributed approximately $14.5 million in accordance\nwith the loan agreement with Wells Fargo Bank (See Note 9 for further information regarding this agreement.); and (b) approximately\n$114 million in draws on the construction line with Wells Fargo Bank (including approximately $21.1 million during Fiscal 2016),\nof which $19 million was used to pay off the loan from FREIT, and $95 million was used toward the construction at the Rotunda.\nOn November 23, 2016, Wells Fargo Bank modified the following terms and conditions of this loan: (i) the total amount that may\nbe drawn on this loan will be decreased from $120 million to $116.1 million, allowing for an additional draw of $2.1 million over\nthe existing balance of approximately $114 million to be used for retail tenant improvements and leasing commissions; (ii) leasing\nbenchmarks will no longer be required to be met including the waiver of the leasing benchmarks FREIT was not in compliance with\nas of June 30, 2016; (iii) Grande Rotunda, LLC will provide an interest reserve to Wells Fargo Bank in the amount of $2 million\nfor the purpose of funding interest payments, and will be obliged to replenish the account balance to $1 million if it should fall\nbelow $500,000; (iv) the maturity date of the loan was changed from December 31, 2017 to October 31, 2017 with no option to extend;\n(v) the interest rate on amount outstanding on the loan was increased by 25 basis points to 250 basis points over the monthly LIBOR.\nRESIDENTIAL SEGMENT\nFREIT currently operates eight (8) multi-family\napartment buildings or complexes totaling 1,472 apartment units. As indicated in the table above under the caption Segment Information,\ntotal revenue and NOI from FREIT\u2019s residential segment for Fiscal 2016 increased by 4.5% and 4.2%, respectively, as compared\nto Fiscal 2015. The increase in total revenue and NOI for Fiscal 2016 was primarily attributable to: (a) the addition of the operating\nresults of the Icon (See discussion below), and (b) increased base rent at our residential properties. Average occupancy levels\nfor the Fiscal 2016 increased 2.6%, over last year\u2019s comparable period.\nSame Property Operating Results: FREIT\u2019s\nresidential segment currently contains seven (7) same properties. (See definition of same property under Segment Information above.)\nSince the Icon property was part of a major redevelopment and expansion project that was substantially completed in the third quarter\nof Fiscal 2016 and has been in operation for less than a full year, it has been excluded from same property results for all periods\npresented. Same property revenue and NOI increased by 2.2% and 5.5%, respectively, from Fiscal 2015 driven primarily by an increase\nin base rents and average occupancy rates at\n26\nTable of Contents\nour residential properties. Exclusive of the Icon property, average occupancy rates\nfor Fiscal 2016 increased 0.5% over last year\u2019s comparable period.\nFREIT\u2019s residential revenue is principally\ncomposed of monthly apartment rental income. Total rental income is a factor of occupancy and monthly apartment rents. Monthly\naverage residential rents, excluding the Rotunda Icon property as it is still in the lease-up period and not operating at full\ncapacity, at the end of Fiscal 2016 and Fiscal 2015 were $1,786 and $1,744, respectively. A 1% decline in annual average occupancy,\nor a 1% decline in average rents from current levels, results in an annual revenue decline of approximately $234,000 and $223,000,\nrespectively.\nCapital expenditures: Since all of FREIT\u2019s\napartment communities, with the exception of the Boulders, Regency and Icon, were constructed more than 25 years ago, FREIT tends\nto spend more in any given year on maintenance and capital improvements than may be spent on newer properties. Funds for these\ncapital projects will be available from cash flow from the property's operations and cash reserves.\nFINANCING COSTS\nYears Ended October 31,\n2016\n2015\n(In Thousands of Dollars)\nFixed rate mortgages (a).\n1st Mortgages\nExisting\n$10,742\n$10,459\nNew\n129\n517\n2nd Mortgages\nExisting\n\u2014\n\u2014\nVariable rate mortgages.\nConstruction loan-Rotunda\n2,840\n1,692\nCredit line\n\u2014\n35\nOther\n293\n326\nTotal financing costs, gross\n14,004\n13,029\nAmortization of mortgage costs\n543\n419\nTotal financing costs, net\n14,547\n13,448\nLess amounts capitalized\n(2,611\n)\n(2,447\n)\nTotal financing costs expensed\n$11,936\n$11,001\n(a) Includes the effect of interest rate swap contracts which effectively convert the floating interest rate to a fixed interest rate over the term of the loan.\nTotal net financing costs for Fiscal 2016 increased\n8.2% as compared to Fiscal 2015 which was primarily attributable to the Rotunda construction loan of approximately $114 million.\n(See Note 5 for more details.)\nINVESTMENT INCOME\nInvestment income for Fiscal 2016 was $150,000\nwith no change from the prior fiscal year. Investment income is principally derived from interest earned from cash on deposit in\ninstitutional money market funds and interest earned from secured loans receivable (loans made to Hekemian employees, including\ncertain members of the immediate family of Robert S. Hekemian, FREIT CEO and Chairman of the Board, and Robert S. Hekemian, Jr.,\na Trustee of FREIT, for their equity investment in Grande Rotunda, LLC, a limited liability company in which FREIT owns a 60% equity\ninterest, and Damascus Centre, LLC, a limited liability company in which FREIT owns a 70% equity interest).\nGENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES (\u201cG\n& A\u201d)\nDuring Fiscal 2016, G & A was $2,034,000\nas compared to $2,029,000 for the prior year\u2019s period. The primary components of G&A are accounting fees, legal and professional\nfees and Trustees\u2019 fees.\nDEPRECIATION\nDepreciation expense from operations for Fiscal\n2016 was $7,852,000 as compared to $6,883,000 for the prior year\u2019s period. The increase in depreciation was primarily attributable\nto the depreciation related to assets at the Rotunda property becoming operational as the major redevelopment and expansion project\nat this property was substantially completed in the third quarter of Fiscal 2016.\n27\nTable of Contents\nResults of Operations.\nFiscal Years Ended October 31, 2015 and 2014\nSummary revenues and net income for the\nfiscal years ended October 31, 2015 (\u201cFiscal 2015\u201d) and October 31, 2014 (\u201cFiscal 2014\u201d) are as follows.\nYears Ended October 31,\n2015\n2014\nChange\n(in thousands, except per share amounts)\nReal estate revenues.\nCommercial properties\n$22,817\n$22,011\n$806\nResidential properties\n21,966\n20,419\n1,547\nTotal real estate revenues\n44,783\n42,430\n2,353\nOperating expenses.\nReal estate operations\n21,062\n19,492\n1,570\nStraight line rent adjustment - bankrupt tenant\n1,046\n\u2014\n1,046\nGeneral and administrative\n2,029\n1,396\n633\nDepreciation\n6,883\n6,346\n537\nTotal operating expenses\n31,020\n27,234\n3,786\nOperating income\n13,763\n15,196\n(1,433\n)\nInvestment income\n150\n184\n(34\n)\nAcquisition costs-Regency\n\u2014\n(648\n)\n648\nFinancing costs\n(11,001\n)\n(11,309\n)\n308\nIncome from continuing operations\n2,912\n3,423\n(511\n)\nIncome from discontinued operations\n\u2014\n7\n(7\n)\nGain on sale of discontinued operation\n\u2014\n8,734\n(8,734\n)\nNet income\n2,912\n12,164\n(9,252\n)\nNet income attributable to noncontrolling\ninterests in subsidiaries\n(281\n)\n(507\n)\n226\nNet income attributable to common equity\n$2,631\n$11,657\n$(9,026\n)\nEarnings per share - basic and diluted.\nContinuing operations\n$0.39\n$0.42\n$(0.03\n)\nDiscontinued operations\n\u2014\n1.27\n(1.27\n)\nNet income attributable to common equity\n$0.39\n$1.69\n$(1.30\n)\nWeighted average shares outstanding.\nBasic and diluted\n6,778\n6,908\nReal estate revenue for Fiscal 2015 increased\n5.5% to $44,783,000 compared to $42,430,000 for Fiscal 2014, inclusive of a $298,000 expense adjustment in Fiscal 2014 to write-off\na straight-line rent balance related to the G-Mart early lease termination at the Westridge Square shopping center.\nNet income attributable to common equity\n(\u201cnet income-common equity\u201d) for Fiscal 2015 was $2,631,000 ($0.39 per share basic and diluted), compared to $11,657,000\n($1.69 per share basic and diluted) for Fiscal 2014.

Adjusted income from continuing operations is a non-GAAP measure, which management believes is a useful and meaningful\ngauge to investors of our operating performance, since it excludes the impact of unusual and infrequent items specifically: a provision\nfor loss related to straight line rent receivable for Pathmark in Fiscal 2015, the G-Mart early lease termination expenses and\nthe Regency acquisition expenses in Fiscal 2014, as well as income applicable to discontinued operations.

Seven are multi-tenanted retail or office centers, and three are single tenanted \u2013 a building formerly\noccupied as a supermarket and two bank branches. FREIT owns land in Rockaway, New Jersey and Rochelle Park, New Jersey from which\nit receives monthly rental income, from tenants who have built and operate bank branches on the land. As indicated in the table\nabove under the caption Segment Information, total revenue and NOI from FREIT\u2019s commercial segment for Fiscal 2015 increased\nby 2.7% and decreased by 1.3%, respectively, as compared to Fiscal 2014. The increase in total revenue for Fiscal 2015 was primarily\nattributable to increased rental income from increased rents and increases in the average occupancy percentage as compared to Fiscal\n2014. The decline in NOI for Fiscal 2015 was primarily attributable to increases in non-reimbursable operating expenses, principally\ntenants\u2019 bad debts.\nSame Property Operating Results: FREIT\u2019s\ncommercial segment contains nine (9) same properties. Since the Rotunda property is currently undergoing a major redevelopment\nand is operating at less than full capacity, it has been excluded from same property results for all periods presented. For Fiscal\n2015, same property revenue for our commercial segment increased by 2.3% and same property NOI decreased by 0.5%, as compared to\nFiscal 2014. The reasons for the changes mirror the discussion in the previous paragraph.\n30\nTable of Contents\nLeasing: The following table reflects\nleasing activity at our commercial properties for comparable leases (leases executed for spaces in which there was a tenant at\nsome point during the previous twelve-month period) and non-comparable leases for Fiscal 2015.\nRETAIL.\nNumber of\nLeases\nLease Area\n(Sq.

Despite minor tenant fall-out at some of our properties,\noccupancy at our other commercial properties has been on the upswing for Fiscal 2015. Average occupancy rates for Fiscal 2015,\nincreased 2.0% from last year\u2019s comparable period. Excluding the impact of the Rotunda property, which is currently undergoing\na major redevelopment project that began in September 2013, average occupancy rates for Fiscal 2015 decreased 1.7% from Fiscal\n2014.\nConstruction related to the expansion\nand renovation of the Damascus Center was completed in November 2011. We are currently in the negotiation process with potential\ntenants for the new, currently available space constructed in the final phase (Phase III) of this project. As of October 31, 2015,\napproximately 84.9% of the space at the Damascus Center is leased and 80.2% is occupied.\nOn December 20, 2013, FREIT\u2019s South\nBrunswick property was sold for $11 million resulting in a capital gain of approximately $8.7 million net of sales fees and commissions.\nFREIT has structured this sale in a manner that qualifies it as a like-kind exchange of real estate pursuant to Section 1031 of\nthe Internal Revenue Code, as amended. Such a transaction will result in a deferral for income tax purposes of the $8.7 million\ncapital gain. On June 18, 2014, FREIT closed on its purchase of the Regency to complete this like-kind exchange transaction. (See\nResidential Segment below and Note 3 for further details.)\nRESIDENTIAL SEGMENT\nFREIT currently operates seven (7) multi-family\napartment communities totaling 1,093 apartment units. As indicated in the table above under the caption Segment Information, total\nrevenue and NOI from FREIT\u2019s residential segment for Fiscal 2015 increased by 7.6% and 6.4%, respectively, as compared to\nFiscal 2014. The increase in total revenue and NOI for Fiscal 2015 was primarily attributable to: (a) the addition of the operating\nresults of the Regency (See discussion below), and (b) increased base rent at our residential properties. Average occupancy levels\nfor the Fiscal 2015 decreased 0.6%, as compared to last year\u2019s comparable period.\nSame Property Operating Results: FREIT\u2019s\nresidential segment currently contains six (6) same properties. (See definition of same property under Segment Information above.)\nThe Regency property is not included as same property, since it was acquired in June 2014 and was not in operation for the full\n2014 fiscal year. Same property revenue increased by 0.4% from Fiscal 2014 while same property NOI remained relatively flat as\ncompared to prior fiscal year, driven primarily by an increase in base rents at our residential properties. Exclusive of the Regency\nproperty, average occupancy rates for Fiscal 2015 decreased 0.7% over last year\u2019s comparable period.\nOur residential revenue is principally\ncomposed of monthly apartment rental income. Total rental income is a factor of occupancy and monthly apartment rents. Monthly\naverage residential rents at the end of Fiscal 2015 and Fiscal 2014 were $1,744 and $1,703, respectively. A 1% decline in annual\naverage occupancy, or a 1% decline in average rents from current levels, results in an annual revenue decline of approximately\n$229,000 and $216,000, respectively.\nOn June 18, 2014, FREIT completed the acquisition\nof the Regency, a residential apartment complex located in Middletown, New York. The Regency complex consists of 132 units in 11\nbuildings and a clubhouse. The acquisition cost was $20,625,000 (exclusive of $648,000 of transaction costs), which was funded\nin part with the $9.8 million in net proceeds from the sale of the South Brunswick land, and the remaining balance of $11.5 million\nwas funded utilizing $10 million of FREIT\u2019s credit line\n31\nTable of Contents\nwith Provident Bank, and FREIT\u2019s available cash. On December\n29, 2014, FREIT Regency, LLC secured long-term financing for the Regency property in the amount of $16.2 million from Provident\nBank (See discussion under Liquidity and Capital Resources). A portion of the loan proceeds was used to replace the funds borrowed\nfrom FREIT\u2019s credit line, and the remainder are available to fund FREIT\u2019s future capital expenditures and for general\ncorporate purposes.\nFREIT identified the Regency as a replacement\nproperty for the vacant land located in South Brunswick, New Jersey that FREIT sold on December 20, 2013. The sale of the South\nBrunswick land and the subsequent purchase of the Regency were structured in a manner that would qualify as a like-kind exchange\nof real estate pursuant to Section 1031 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, and resulted in a deferral for income\ntax purposes of the realization of the $8.7 million gain on the sale of the South Brunswick land. FREIT\u2019s acquisition of\nthe Regency completed this like-kind exchange.\nFINANCING COSTS\nYears Ended October 31,\n2015\n2014\n(In Thousands of Dollars)\nFixed rate mortgages (a).\n1st Mortgages\nExisting\n$10,459\n$9,810\nNew\n517\n826\n2nd Mortgages\nExisting\n\u2014\n12\nVariable rate mortgages.\nConstruction loan-Rotunda\n1,692\n560\nCredit line\n35\n107\nOther\n326\n745\nTotal financing costs, gross\n13,029\n12,060\nAmortization of mortgage costs\n419\n359\nTotal financing costs, net\n13,448\n12,419\nLess amounts capitalized\n(2,447\n)\n(1,110\n)\nTotal financing costs expensed\n$11,001\n$11,309\n(a) Includes the\neffect of interest rate swap contracts which effectively convert the floating interest rate to a fixed interest rate over the\nterm of the loan.\nTotal financing costs for Fiscal 2015 increased\n8.3% as compared to Fiscal 2014. The increase for Fiscal 2015 was primarily attributable to the Rotunda construction loan of $92\nmillion and the Regency loan of $16.2 million (See Note 5 for more details.)\nINVESTMENT INCOME\nInvestment income for Fiscal 2015 was $150,000\nas compared to $184,000 for the prior year\u2019s period. The primary reason for the decrease in investment income for the current\nfiscal year was due to a lower level of interest income related to the discounting of the Giant lease termination fee at the Rotunda\nas the lease terminated on March 31, 2015. Investment income is principally derived from interest earned from cash on deposit in\ninstitutional money market funds and interest earned from secured loans receivable (loans made to Hekemian employees, including\ncertain members of the immediate family of Robert S. Hekemian, FREIT CEO and Chairman of the Board, and Robert S. Hekemian, Jr.,\na Trustee of FREIT, for their equity investment in Grande Rotunda, LLC, a limited liability company in which FREIT owns a 60% equity\ninterest, and Damascus Centre, LLC, a limited liability company in which FREIT owns a 70% equity interest).\nGENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES (\u201cG\n& A\u201d)\nDuring Fiscal 2015, G & A was $2,029,000\nas compared to $1,396,000 for the prior year\u2019s period. The primary components of G&A are accounting fees, legal and professional\nfees and Trustees\u2019 fees. The primary reason for the increase in G&A was the increase in Trustees\u2019 fees, as a result\nof a change in the Deferred Fee Plan, along with increases in Trustee meeting attendance fees and annual retainer fees effective\nNovember 1, 2014.\nDEPRECIATION\nDepreciation expense from operations for Fiscal\n2015 was $6,883,000 as compared to $6,346,000 for the prior year\u2019s period. The increase in depreciation was primarily attributable\nto the depreciation related to the Regency acquisition and certain assets becoming operational in Fiscal 2015.\n32\nTable of Contents\nLIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES\nNet cash provided by operating activities\nwas $8.1 million for Fiscal 2016 compared to $12 million for Fiscal 2015. FREIT expects that cash provided by operating activities\nand cash reserves will be adequate to cover mandatory debt service payments (including payments of interest, but excluding balloon\npayments), real estate taxes, recurring capital improvements and dividends necessary to retain qualification as a REIT (90% of\ntaxable income).\nAs at October 31, 2016, FREIT had cash\nand cash equivalents totaling $10.9 million compared to $13.5 million at October 31, 2015. The decrease in cash for Fiscal 2016\nis primarily attributable to $20.4 million in net cash used in investing activities offset by $9.7 million provided by financing\nactivities and $8.1 million provided by operating activities.\nOn June 17, 2016, FREIT sold its property\nheld at Rochelle Park, New Jersey to Lakeland Bank (as successor by merger to Pascack Community Bank) for $3.1 million, realizing\na gain of approximately $0.3 million net of sales fees. This sale will result in FREIT\u2019s loss of future annual rents of approximately\n$241,000, which would have increased periodically through September 2023.\nCredit Line: FREIT has a line of credit\nprovided by the Provident Bank in the amount of $12.8 million. The line of credit was for a two year term ending on November 1,\n2016, which was extended by the bank to February 1, 2017 while the bank completes its due diligence. FREIT expects the credit\nline will be extended for an additional period of 24 months. Draws against the credit line can be used for general corporate purposes,\nfor property acquisitions, construction activities, and letters of credit. Draws against the credit line are secured by mortgages\non FREIT\u2019s Franklin Crossing Shopping Center in Franklin Lakes, New Jersey and retail space in Glen Rock, New Jersey. Interest\nrates on draws will be set at the time of each draw for 30, 60, or 90-day periods, based on FREIT\u2019s choice of the prime rate\nor at 175 basis points over the 30, 60, or 90-day LIBOR rates at the time of the draws. The interest rate on the line of credit\nhas a floor of 3.25%. As of October 31, 2016, approximately $12.8 million was available under the line of credit.\nThe modernization and expansion project\nat the Damascus Center was completed in November 2011. Total construction costs, inclusive of tenant improvement costs, approximated\n$22.7 million. Total construction and development costs were funded, in part, from a $21.3 million (as modified) construction loan\nfacility, of which approximately $15 million was drawn and advances by FREIT in the approximate aggregate amount of $3.2 million.\nThe construction loan, including the exercise of a one twelve (12) month extension option, was scheduled to mature on February\n12, 2013. On December 26, 2012, Damascus Centre, LLC refinanced its construction loan with long-term financing provided by People\u2019s\nUnited Bank and the first tranche of the new loan was taken-down in the amount of $20 million. Based on leasing and net operating\nincome at the shopping center, People\u2019s United Bank agreed to a take-down of the second tranche of this loan on April 22,\n2016 in the amount of $2,320,000, of which approximately $470,000 was readily available and the remaining $1,850,000 (included\nin prepaid expenses and other assets in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet) is held in escrow and available to Damascus\nCentre, LLC once certain tenants open and begin paying rent. The total amount outstanding for both tranches of this loan held with\nPeople\u2019s United Bank as of October 31, 2016 was approximately $20.8 million. The loan has a maturity date of January 3, 2023\nand bears a floating interest rate equal to 210 points over the one-month BBA LIBOR. In order to minimize interest rate volatility\nduring the term of this loan, Damascus Centre, LLC entered into an interest rate swap agreement that, in effect, converted the\nfloating interest rate to a fixed interest rate on each tranche of this loan, resulting in a fixed rate of 3.81% over the term\nof the first tranche of this loan and a fixed rate of 3.53% over the term of the second tranche of this loan. The interest rate\nswaps are considered a derivative financial instrument that will be used only to reduce interest rate risk, and not held or used\nfor trading purposes. (See Note 6 for additional information relating to the interest rate swaps.)\nThe Rotunda property in Baltimore, Maryland\n(owned by FREIT\u2019s 60% owned affiliate Grande Rotunda, LLC) is an 11.5 acre site containing a building with approximately\n132,000 sq. ft. of office space and approximately 84,000 sq. ft. of retail space on the lower level of the building. In September\n2013, FREIT began construction to redevelop and expand this property and, with the exception of tenant improvements, was substantially\ncompleted in the third quarter of Fiscal 2016 with costs to complete estimated at $1 million. The redevelopment and expansion plans\nincluded a modernization of the office building and smaller adjacent buildings, construction of 379 residential apartment rental\nunits, an additional 75,000 square feet of new retail space, and 864 above level parking spaces. As of October 31, 2016, the residential\nsection is approximately 29% leased and the retail space is approximately 71% leased. FREIT expects the Rotunda to generate positive\ncash flow in the latter half of fiscal year 2017.\nThe original Rotunda acquisition loan\nfor $22.5 million, which was subsequently reduced to $19.5 million on February 1, 2010, was acquired by FREIT on May 28, 2013.\nFREIT subsequently sold this loan to Wells Fargo Bank. On December 9, 2013, Grande Rotunda, LLC closed with Wells Fargo Bank on\na construction loan of up to $120 million to be used to redevelop and expand the Rotunda property in Baltimore, Maryland with a\nterm of four (4) years, with one 12-month extension, at a rate of 225 basis points over the monthly LIBOR. The loan is secured\nby the Rotunda property, which has a net book value of approximately $155,552,000 as of October 31, 2016. Through October 31, 2016,\nfunding for the construction at the Rotunda was provided by: (a) the Grande Rotunda, LLC members, FREIT and Rotunda 100, LLC, who\ncontributed approximately $14.5 million in accordance with the loan agreement with Wells Fargo Bank (See Note 9 for further information\nregarding this agreement.); and (b) approximately $114 million in draws on the construction line with Wells Fargo Bank (including\napproximately $21.1 million during Fiscal 2016), of which $19 million was used to pay off the loan from FREIT, and $95 million\nwas used toward the construction at the Rotunda.\n33\nTable of Contents\nOn November 23, 2016, Wells Fargo Bank\nmodified the following terms and conditions of this loan: (i) the total amount that may be drawn on this loan will be decreased\nfrom $120 million to $116.1 million, allowing for an additional draw of $2.1 million over the existing balance of approximately\n$114 million to be used for retail tenant improvements and leasing commissions; (ii) leasing benchmarks will no longer be required\nto be met including the waiver of the leasing benchmarks FREIT was not in compliance with as of June 30, 2016; (iii) Grande Rotunda,\nLLC will provide an interest reserve to Wells Fargo Bank in the amount of $2 million for the purpose of funding interest payments,\nand will be obliged to replenish the account balance to $1 million if it should fall below $500,000; (iv) the maturity date of\nthe loan was changed from December 31, 2017 to October 31, 2017 with no option to extend; (v) the interest rate on amount outstanding\non the loan was increased by 25 basis points to 250 basis points over the monthly LIBOR.\nWith regard to the funding of the Rotunda\nredevelopment project, Wells Fargo Bank required that the Grande Rotunda, LLC contribute not less than $14,460,000 towards the\nconstruction before any construction loan proceeds could be disbursed. To secure these funds Grande Rotunda, LLC made a capital\ncall on its members \u2013 FREIT and Rotunda 100, LLC (\u201cRotunda 100\u201d). FREIT\u2019s share (60%) amounted to approximately\n$8.7 million, and the Rotunda 100 members\u2019 share (40%) amounted to approximately $5.8 million. FREIT, pursuant to previous\nagreements, made secured loans to the Rotunda 100 members of approximately $2.1 million towards their share of the $5.8 million\ncapital call. The balance of Rotunda 100\u2019s capital call of approximately $3.7 million was initially made by FREIT until it\nwas repaid by Rotunda 100 in August 2014. These loans bear an interest rate of 225 basis points over the 90 day LIBOR, and had\na maturity date of June 19, 2015. On June 4, 2015, the Board approved an extension of the maturity date to occur the earlier of\n(a) June 19, 2018 or (b) five days after the closing of a permanent mortgage loan secured by the Rotunda property. Rotunda 100\nis principally owned by employees of Hekemian, including certain members of the immediate family of Robert S. Hekemian and Robert\nS. Hekemian, Jr.\nAs of October 31, 2016, FREIT and Rotunda\n100 have made their required capital call contributions of $8.7 million and $5.8 million, respectively, towards the Rotunda construction\nfinancing. Both FREIT and the Rotunda 100 members are treating their required capital call contributions as additional investments\nin Grande Rotunda, LLC.\nAs at October 31, 2016, FREIT\u2019s aggregate\noutstanding mortgage debt was $329.7 million, which bears a weighted average interest rate of 4.04% and an average life of approximately\n4.9 years. FREIT\u2019s fixed rate mortgages are subject to amortization schedules that are longer than the term of the mortgages.\nAs such, balloon payments (unpaid principal amounts at mortgage due date) for all mortgage debt will be required as follows.\nFiscal Year\n2017\n2018\n2019\n2021\n2022\n2023\n2024\n2025\n2026\n($ in millions)\nMortgage \"Balloon\" Payments\n$136.0\n$5.2\n$45.2\n$19.1\n$14.4\n$34.5\n$15.9\n$13.9\n$18.2\nThe following table shows the estimated\nfair value and carrying value of FREIT\u2019s long-term debt at October 31, 2016 and 2015.\n($ in Millions)\nOctober 31, 2016\nOctober 31, 2015\nFair Value\n$331.3\n$313.5\nCarrying Value\n$327.2\n$304.8\nFair values are estimated based on market\ninterest rates at the end of each fiscal year and on discounted cash flow analysis. Changes in assumptions or estimation methods\nmay significantly affect these fair value estimates. The fair value is based on observable inputs (level 2 in the fair value hierarchy\nas provided by authoritative guidance).\nFREIT expects to refinance the individual\nmortgages with new mortgages when their terms expire. To this extent FREIT has exposure to interest rate risk. If interest rates,\nat the time any individual mortgage note is due, are higher than the current fixed interest rate, higher debt service may be required,\nand\/or refinancing proceeds may be less than the amount of mortgage debt being retired. For example, at October 31, 2016, a 1%\ninterest rate increase would reduce the fair value of FREIT\u2019s debt by $7.5 million, and a 1% decrease would increase\nthe fair value by $8 million.\nFREIT believes that the values of its\nproperties will be adequate to command refinancing proceeds equal to or higher than the mortgage debt to be refinanced. FREIT continually\nreviews its debt levels to determine if additional debt can prudently be utilized for property acquisition additions to our real\nestate portfolio that will increase income and cash flow to shareholders.\nOn November 19, 2013, FREIT refinanced\nthe first mortgages on its Hammel Gardens and Steuben Arms properties that were scheduled to mature on December 1, 2013. The mortgages,\naggregating $9.4 million, were refinanced for $19.7 million. The new mortgage amounts reflect, in part, the appreciated value of\nthose assets. This refinancing resulted in: (i) a reduction of annual interest costs from 6.4% to 4.54%, and (ii) net refinancing\nproceeds of approximately $10 million that were available for capital expenditures and general corporate purposes.\nOn December 29, 2014, FREIT Regency,\nLLC closed on a $16.2 million mortgage loan from Provident Bank. The new loan bears a floating interest rate equal to 125 basis\npoints over the one-month BBA LIBOR and the loan will mature on December 15, 2024. Interest-only payments are required each month\nthrough December 15, 2017. Thereafter, principal payments of\n34\nTable of Contents\n$27,807 (plus accrued interest) are required each month through maturity.\nIn order to minimize interest rate volatility during the term of the loan, FREIT Regency, LLC entered into an interest rate swap\nagreement that, in effect, converted the floating interest rate to a fixed interest rate of 3.75% over the term of the loan. Proceeds\nfrom the loan were used to pay off the $5 million outstanding balance on FREIT\u2019s credit line, and the remainder of the proceeds\nwill be available to fund future capital expenditures and for general corporate purposes. The interest rate swap is considered\na derivative financial instrument that will be used only to reduce interest rate risk, and not held or used for trading purposes.\n(See Note 6 for additional information relating to the interest rate swap contract.)\nOn September 29, 2016, Wayne PSC, LLC\nrefinanced its $24.2 million mortgage loan held with Metropolitan Life Insurance Company, with a new mortgage loan from People\u2019s\nUnited Bank in the amount of $25.8 million. The new loan, secured by a shopping center in Wayne, New Jersey, bears a floating interest\nrate equal to 220 basis points over the one-month BBA LIBOR with a maturity date of October 1, 2026. In order to minimize interest\nrate volatility during the term of the loan, Wayne PSC, LLC entered into an interest rate swap agreement that, in effect, converted\nthe floating interest rate to a fixed interest rate of 3.625% over the term of the loan. This refinancing resulted in: (i) a reduction\nin interest rate from 6.04% to 3.625% and (ii) net refinancing proceeds of approximately $1 million that were distributed to the\npartners in Wayne PSC, LLC with FREIT receiving $0.4 million based on it 40% membership interest in Wayne PSC, LLC. The interest\nrate swap is considered a derivative financial instrument that will be used only to reduce interest rate risk, and not held or\nused for trading purposes. (See Note 6 for additional information relating to the interest rate swap contract.)\nInterest rate swap contracts: To reduce\ninterest rate volatility, FREIT uses a \u201cpay fixed, receive floating\u201d interest rate swap to convert floating interest\nrates to fixed interest rates over the term of a certain loan. FREIT enters into these swap contracts with a counterparty that\nis usually a high-quality commercial bank.\nIn essence, FREIT agrees to pay its counterparties\na fixed rate of interest on a dollar amount of notional principal (which corresponds to FREIT\u2019s mortgage debt) over a term\nequal to the term of the mortgage notes. FREIT\u2019s counterparties, in return, agree to pay FREIT a short-term rate of interest\n- generally LIBOR - on that same notional amount over the same term as the mortgage notes.\nCurrent GAAP requires FREIT to mark-to-market\nfixed pay interest rate swaps. As the floating interest rate varies from time-to-time over the term of the contract, the value\nof the contract will change upward or downward. If the floating rate is higher than the fixed rate, the value of the contract goes\nup and there is a gain and an asset. If the floating rate is less than the fixed rate, there is a loss and a liability. These gains\nor losses will not affect FREIT\u2019s income statement. Changes in the fair value of these swap contracts will be reported in\nother comprehensive income and appear in the equity section of the balance sheet. This gain or loss represents the economic consequence\nof liquidating fixed rate swap contracts and replacing them with like-duration funding at current market rates, something FREIT\nwould likely never do. Periodic cash settlements of these swap contracts will be accounted for as an adjustment to interest expense.\nFREIT has variable interest rate mortgages\nsecuring its Damascus Center, Regency, and Wayne PSC properties. To reduce interest rate fluctuations, FREIT entered into interest\nrate swap contracts for each of these loans. These interest rate swap contracts effectively converted variable interest rate payments\nto fixed interest rate payments. The contracts were based on a notional amount of approximately $22,320,000 ($20,868,000 at October\n31, 2016) for the Damascus Center swaps, a notional amount of approximately $16,200,000 ($16,200,000 at October 31, 2016) for the\nRegency swap, and a notional amount of approximately $25,800,000 ($25,800,000 at October 31, 2016) for the Wayne PSC swap. FREIT\nhas the following derivative-related risks with its swap contracts: 1) early termination risk, and 2) counterparty credit risk.\nEarly Termination Risk: If\nFREIT wants to terminate its swap contract before maturity, it would be bought out or terminated at market value; i.e., the\ndifference in the present value of the anticipated net cash flows from each of the swap\u2019s parties. If current variable\ninterest rates are significantly below FREIT\u2019s fixed interest rate payments, this could be costly. Conversely, if\ninterest rates rise above FREIT\u2019s fixed interest payments and FREIT elected early termination, FREIT would realize\na gain on termination. At October 31, 2016, the swap contracts for the Damascus Center and Regency properties were in the\ncounterparties\u2019 favor and the swap contract for the Wayne PSC property was in FREIT\u2019s favor. If FREIT had\nterminated these contracts at that date it would have realized a loss of approximately $521,000 for the Damascus Center swaps\nand a loss of approximately $1,361,000 for the Regency swap, both of which have been included as a liability in FREIT\u2019s\nconsolidated balance sheet as at October 31, 2016, and a gain of approximately $91,000 for the Wayne PSC swap which has been\nincluded as an asset in FREIT\u2019s consolidated balance sheet as at October 31, 2016. The change for these swaps (gain or\nloss) during such period has been included in comprehensive income. For the year ended October 31, 2016, FREIT recorded an\nunrealized loss of $725,000 in comprehensive income representing the change in fair value of the swaps during such period.\nFor the year ended October 31, 2015, FREIT recorded an unrealized loss of $1,581,000 in comprehensive income representing the\nchange in the fair value of the swaps during such period and a corresponding liability of $945,000 for the Regency swap and\n$121,000 for the Damascus Center swap as of October 31, 2015.\nCounterparty Credit Risk: Each party\nto a swap contract bears the risk that its Counterparty will default on its obligation to make a periodic payment.

Although many\nconsider FFO as the standard measurement of a REIT\u2019s performance, FREIT modified the NAREIT computation of FFO to include\nother adjustments to GAAP net income that are not considered by management to be the primary drivers of their decision making process.\nThese adjustments to GAAP net income are amortization of acquired leases, straight-line rents, acquisition expenses, FFO from discontinued\noperations and recurring capital improvements on FREIT\u2019s residential apartments. The modified FFO computation is referred\nto as Adjusted Funds From Operations (\u201cAFFO\u201d). FREIT believes that AFFO is a superior measure of its operating performance.\nFREIT computes FFO and AFFO as follows.\nYears Ended October 31,\n2016\n2015\n2014\n(In Thousands, Except Per Share)\nFunds From Operations (\"FFO\") (a)\nNet income\n$3,099\n$2,912\n$12,164\nDepreciation of consolidated properties\n7,852\n6,883\n6,346\nAmortization of deferred leasing costs\n410\n260\n391\nGain on sale of discontinued operations\n\u2014\n\u2014\n(8,734\n)\nGain on sale of commercial property\n(314\n)\n\u2014\n\u2014\nDistributions to minority interests\n(1,095\n)\n(516\n)\n(975\n)\nFFO\n$9,952\n$9,539\n$9,192\nPer Share - Basic and Diluted\n$1.47\n$1.41\n$1.33\n(a) As prescribed by NAREIT.\nAdjusted Funds From Operations (\"AFFO\")\nFFO\n$9,952\n$9,539\n$9,192\nAmortization of acquired leases\n\u2014\n1\n21\nDeferred rents (Straight lining)\n(608\n)\n219\n391\nStraight line rent adjustment - bankrupt tenant\n\u2014\n1,046\n\u2014\nAcquisition expenses-Regency\n\u2014\n\u2014\n648\nLess: FFO from discontinued operations\n\u2014\n\u2014\n(7\n)\nCapital Improvements - Apartments\n(898\n)\n(424\n)\n(549\n)\nAFFO\n$8,446\n$10,381\n$9,696\nPer Share - Basic and Diluted\n$1.25\n$1.53\n$1.40\nWeighted Average Shares Outstanding.\nBasic\n6,783\n6,778\n6,908\nDiluted\n6,784\n6,778\n6,908\nFFO and AFFO do not represent cash generated\nfrom operating activities in accordance with GAAP, and therefore should not be considered a substitute for net income as a measure\nof results of operations or for cash flow from operations as a measure of liquidity.

On December 17, 2013, FREIT repurchased 20,400 shares in a privately-negotiated transaction\nwith an unaffiliated party for an aggregate purchase price of $357,000, or $17.50 per share.\nOn September 4, 2014, the Board authorized\nthe repurchase of 100,572 FREIT shares held by the pension plan of Hekemian & Co., Inc., FREIT\u2019s managing agent, for\nan aggregate cash purchase of $1,855,553 or $18.45 per share, which was the closing price of FREIT shares on September 3, 2014.\nThe repurchase which occurred in September 2014 was undertaken in connection with the termination of the pension plan. Robert S.\nHekemian, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of FREIT, and Robert S. Hekemian, Jr., a Trustee of FREIT, and members of their\nfamily were participants in the pension plan.\nOn February 17, 2015, FREIT announced\na tender offer to purchase up to 100,000 shares of FREIT\u2019s beneficial interest at a price of $23.00 per share. The number\nof shares proposed to be purchased in the tender offer represented approximately 1.5% of FREIT\u2019s then-outstanding shares.\nThe tender offer expired on March 20, 2015, and in connection therewith FREIT repurchased 94,302 shares of FREIT\u2019s beneficial\ninterest at $23.00 per share for an aggregate purchase price of $2,168,946, which it funded principally from cash and cash equivalents.\nFREIT\u2019s Trustees and executive officers did not tender their shares of beneficial interest in FREIT in the tender offer.\n(See Note 15 for further details.)\n37\nTable of Contents\nStock Option Plan\nOn September 4, 2014, the Board approved\nthe grant of a total of 246,000 non-qualified share options under FREIT\u2019s Equity Incentive Plan to certain FREIT Executive\nOfficers, the members of the Board and certain employees of Hekemian & Co., Inc. The options have an exercise price of $18.45\nper share, will vest over a 5 year period at 20% per year, and will expire 10 years from the date of grant, which will be September\n3, 2024. (See Note 11 for further details.)\nOn\nNovember 10, 2016, the Board approved the grant of a total of 38,000 non-qualified share options under the Plan to two members\nof the Board who were appointed to the Board during Fiscal 2016. The options have an exercise price of $21.00 per share, will vest\nin equal annual installments over a 5-year period, and will expire 10 years from the date of grant, which will be November 9, 2026.\nDeferred Fee Plan\nOn September 4, 2014, the Board approved\namendments, effective November 1, 2014, to the FREIT Deferred Fee Plan for its Executive Officers and Trustees, one of which provides\nfor the issuance of share units payable in FREIT shares in respect of (i) deferred amounts of all Trustee fees on a prospective\nbasis; (ii) interest on Trustee fees deferred prior to November 1, 2014 (payable at a floating rate, adjusted quarterly, based\non the average 10-year Treasury Bond interest rate plus 150 basis points); and (iii) dividends payable in respect of share units\nallocated to participants in the Deferred Fee Plan as a result of deferrals described above. The number of share units will be\ndetermined by the closing price of FREIT shares on the date set forth in the Deferred Fee Plan. (See Note 12 for further details.)\nDistributions to Shareholders\nSince its inception in 1961, FREIT has elected\nto be treated as a REIT for federal income tax purposes. In order to qualify as a REIT, FREIT must satisfy a number of highly technical\nand complex operational requirements including that FREIT must distribute to its shareholders at least 90% of its REIT taxable\nincome. FREIT anticipates making distributions to shareholders from operating cash flows. Although cash used to make distributions\nreduces amounts available for capital investment, FREIT generally intends to distribute not less than the minimum of REIT taxable\nincome necessary to satisfy the applicable REIT requirement as set forth in the Internal Revenue Code. With respect to the Jobs\nand Growth Tax Relief Reconciliation Act of 2003, the reduction of the tax rate on dividends does not apply to FREIT dividends\nother than capital gains dividends, which are subject to capital gains rates. FREIT\u2019s policy is to pass on at least 90% of\nits ordinary taxable income to shareholders. FREIT\u2019s taxable income is untaxed at the trust level to the extent distributed\nto shareholders. FREIT\u2019s dividends of ordinary taxable income will be taxed as ordinary income to its shareholders and FREIT\u2019s\ncapital gains dividends will be taxed as capital gains to its shareholders. It has been FREIT\u2019s policy to pay fixed quarterly\ndividends for the first three quarters of each fiscal year, and a final fourth quarter dividend based on the fiscal year\u2019s\nnet income and taxable income. For the past four (4) years, FREIT has paid an annual dividend of at least $1.20 per share. Based\non the loss for the fourth quarter ended October 31, 2016 and the continuing costs required for retail tenant fit-ups and residential\nlease-up costs at The Rotunda property, FREIT does not expect that it will sustain the payment of dividends at the levels paid\nin prior years.\nThe following tables list the quarterly\ndividends declared for the three most recent fiscal years and the dividends as a percentage of taxable income for those periods.\nFiscal Years Ended October 31,\n2016\n2015\n2014\nFirst Quarter\n$0.30\n$0.30\n$0.30\nSecond Quarter\n$0.30\n$0.30\n$0.30\nThird Quarter\n$0.30\n$0.30\n$0.30\nFourth Quarter\n$0.30\n$0.30\n$0.30\nTotal For Year\n$1.20\n$1.20\n$1.20\n(in thousands of dollars)\nDividends\nFiscal\nPer\nTotal\nOrdinary\nCapital Gain\nTaxable\nas a % of\nYear\nShare\nDividends\nIncome-Tax Basis\nIncome-Tax Basis\nIncome\nTaxable Income\n2016\n$1.20\n$8,152\n$2,766\n*\n$2,569\n$5,335\n*\n152.8%\n2015\n$1.20\n$8,130\n$4,303\n$\u2014\n$4,303\n188.9%\n2014\n$1.20\n$8,276\n$5,658\n$50\n$5,708\n145.0%\n*Estimated\nINFLATION\nInflation can impact the financial performance\nof FREIT in various ways. FREIT\u2019s commercial tenant leases normally provide that the tenants bear all or a portion of\nmost operating expenses, which can reduce the impact of inflationary increases on FREIT. Apartment leases are normally for a one-year\nterm, which may allow FREIT to seek increased rents as leases renew or when new tenants are obtained, subject to prevailing market\nconditions.\n38\nTable of Contents","12":"","13":"ITEM 7.\nMANAGEMENT\u0092S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nThis Management\u0092s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations includes many forward-looking statements.\nFor cautions about relying on such forward looking statements, please refer to the section entitled \u0093Forward Looking Statements\u0094 at the beginning of this Report immediately prior to Item 1.\nGeneral\nWe are a leading company in\ndeveloping and commercializing high temperature superconductor (\u0093HTS\u0094) materials and related technologies. HTS materials can substantially improve the performance characteristics of electrical systems, reducing power loss, lowering heat\ngeneration, and decreasing electrical noise.\nResults of Operations\n2016 Compared to 2015\nRevenues consist primarily\nof commercial product revenues. Revenues decreased by $113,000 or 46%, to $131,000 in 2016 from $244,000 in 2015. Sales of our new Conductus wire were equal to $1,000 or 1%, of our total revenue in 2016. Sales of our Conductus wire are expected to\nincrease as we reach commercial production of Conductus wire currently anticipated for the second half of 2017 following completion of qualification orders.\nThe decrease is the result of lower sales volume for our wireless communications products as we grow sales of our Conductus wire. We sell our\nlegacy wireless communications products to large North American wireless operators whose spending on 3G data networks, where our products are deployed, has become a secondary priority. Sales prices for wireless products were essentially unchanged in\n2016 from 2015. Our two largest customers accounted for 78% of our net commercial revenues in 2016 and 80% of our net commercial revenues in 2015. These customers generally purchase products through\nnon-binding\ncommitments with minimal lead-times. Consequently, our commercial product revenues can fluctuate dramatically from quarter to quarter based on changes in our customers\u0092 capital spending\npatterns. We do not anticipate that the revenues for our legacy products will be significant in the future.\nCost of revenues includes all\ndirect costs, manufacturing overhead, preproduction process development and provision for excess and obsolete inventories. The cost of revenues totaled $3.4 million for 2016 compared to $3.0 million for 2015, an increase of\n$0.4 million, or 13%. The higher costs resulted principally from increased manufacturing operating expenses and low capacity preproduction operation, of our Conductus wire production equipment.\nOur cost of revenues includes both variable and fixed cost components. The variable component consists primarily of materials, assembly and\ntest labor, overhead, which includes equipment and facility depreciation, transportation costs and warranty costs. The fixed component includes test equipment and facility depreciation, purchasing and procurement expenses and quality assurance\ncosts. Given the fixed nature of such costs, the absorption of our production overhead costs into inventory decreases and the amount of production overhead variances charged to cost of sales increases as production volumes decline since we have\nfewer units to absorb\n19\nTable of Contents\nour overhead costs against. Conversely, the absorption of our production overhead costs into inventory increases and the amount of production overhead variances expensed to cost of sales\ndecreases as production volumes increase since we have more units to absorb our overhead costs against. As a result, our gross profit margins generally decrease as revenue and production volumes decline due to lower sales volume and higher amounts\nof production overhead variances expensed to cost of sales; and our gross profit margins generally increase as our revenue and production volumes increase due to higher sales volume and lower amounts of production overhead variances expensed to cost\nof sales.\nThe following is an analysis of our product gross profit margins for 2016 and 2015.\nYears Ended December 31,\nDollars in Thousands\n2016\n2015\nProduct sales\n$131\n100%\n$244\n100%\nCost of product sales\n3,444\n2,629%\n3,004\n1,231%\nGross loss\n$(3,313\n)\n2,529%\n$(2,760\n)\n1,131%\nWe had a gross loss of $3.3 million in 2016 from the sale of our products compared to a gross loss of\n$2.8 million in 2015. We experienced a gross loss in 2016 due to: our increased manufacturing efforts to bring our Conductus wire production to market; our processes not yet being finalized for high yield manufacturing and; our sales being\ninsufficient to cover our overhead. As we emphasize improving manufacturing processes and increasing our yields at lower than optimal capacity, we expect gross losses to continue in the first half of 2017.\nResearch and development expenses relate to development of new wire products and new wire product manufacturing processes. In 2016, there were\nno new research and development efforts for our wireless commercial products. Research and development expenses totaled $2.8 million in 2016 compared to $4.1 million in 2015, a decrease of $1.3 million, or 32%. Our 2016 expenses were\nlower compared to 2015 as a result of our efforts moving from research and development to manufacturing of our new Conductus wire products.\nSelling, general and administrative expenses totaled $5.1 million in 2016 compared to $5.8 million in 2015, a decrease of\n$0.7 million, or 12%. The lower expenses in 2016 were primarily the result of lower stock-based compensation expense.\nWe had a gain\nfrom the decreased fair value of warrant derivatives of $0.2 million in 2016 compared to a gain of $4.8 million in 2015. The primary reason for the gains was the drop in our stock price offset by the resulting effect of the reduction in\nthe exercise price of certain warrants. This warrant liability is adjusted to fair value each reporting period, and any change in value is recognized in the statement of operations. In 2016, we also had a $66,000 warrant price revaluation expense\ndue to our August 2016 and December 2016 financing. See Note 5 \u0097 Stockholders\u0092 Equity.\nWarrants.\nOther income of $10,000\nand $13,000 in 2016 and 2015, respectively, included $10,000 and $1,000, respectively, of interest income. Also included in 2015 was income of $12,000 from the sale of expensed tooling related to our legacy wireless products.\nOther expense in 2016 was $0 compared to a $207,000 in 2015. The 2015 expense was for early termination of part of our Santa Barbara\nfacilities lease.\nNet loss totaled $11.1 million in 2016, compared to $8.6 million in 2015, an increase of $2.5 million,\nor 29%. The increase in net loss principally resulted from a 2015\nnon-cash\ngain of $4.8 million from the fair value adjustments to our warrant derivatives lessened by $2.0 million lower 2016 research\nand development, and selling general and administrative expenses.\n20\nTable of Contents\nThe net loss available to common stockholders totaled $3.53 per common share in 2016, compared to\na net loss of $6.55 per common share in 2015, a decrease of $3.02, or 46%. The decreased loss per common share in 2016 principally resulted from a greater number of common shares outstanding at December 31, 2016 compared to December 31,\n2015.\n2015 Compared to 2014\nRevenues consist primarily of commercial product revenues. Revenues decreased by $388,000 or 61%, to $244,000 in 2015 from $632,000 in 2014.\nSales of our new Conductus wire were equal to $47,000, or 19%, of our total revenue in 2015.\nThe decrease is the result of lower sales\nvolume for our wireless communications products as we grow sales of our Conductus wire. We sell this legacy product to large North American wireless operators whose spending on 3G data networks, where our products are deployed, has become a\nsecondary priority. Sales prices for wireless products were essentially unchanged in 2015 from 2014. Our two largest customers accounted for 80% of our net commercial revenues in 2015 and 83% of our net commercial revenues in 2014. These customers\ngenerally purchase products through\nnon-binding\ncommitments with minimal lead-times. Consequently, our commercial product revenues can fluctuate dramatically from quarter to quarter based on changes in our\ncustomers\u0092 capital spending patterns. We do not anticipate that the revenues for our legacy products will be significant in the future.\nCost of revenues includes all direct costs, manufacturing overhead, preproduction process development and provision for excess and obsolete\ninventories. The cost of revenues totaled $3.0 million for 2015 compared to $1.6 million for 2014, an increase of $1.4 million, or 88%. The higher costs resulted principally from increased manufacturing operating expenses and early\nlow capacity operation and efforts to improve yields from our new Conductus wire production equipment.\nOur cost of revenues includes both\nvariable and fixed cost components. The variable component consists primarily of materials, assembly and test labor, overhead, which includes equipment and facility depreciation, transportation costs and warranty costs. The fixed component includes\ntest equipment and facility depreciation, purchasing and procurement expenses and quality assurance costs. Given the fixed nature of such costs, the absorption of our production overhead costs into inventory decreases and the amount of production\noverhead variances charged to cost of sales increases as production volumes decline since we have fewer units to absorb our overhead costs against. Conversely, the absorption of our production overhead costs into inventory increases and the amount\nof production overhead variances expensed to cost of sales decreases as production volumes increase since we have more units to absorb our overhead costs against. As a result, our gross profit margins generally decrease as revenue and production\nvolumes decline due to lower sales volume and higher amounts of production overhead variances expensed to cost of sales; and our gross profit margins generally increase as our revenue and production volumes increase due to higher sales volume and\nlower amounts of production overhead variances expensed to cost of sales.\nThe following is an analysis of our commercial product gross\nprofit margins for 2015 and 2014.\nYears Ended December 31,\nDollars in Thousands\n2015\n2014\nProduct sales\n$244\n100%\n$632\n100%\nCost of product sales\n3,004\n1,231%\n1,558\n246%\nGross loss\n$(2,760\n)\n1,131%\n$(926\n)\n146%\nWe had a gross loss of $2.8 million in 2015 from the sale of our products compared to a gross loss of\n$0.9 million in 2014. We experienced a gross loss in 2015 due to: increases in equipment depreciation, as we\n21\nTable of Contents\nbring new Conductus wire equipment into service; our increased manufacturing efforts to bring our Conductus wire production to market and; our sales being insufficient to cover our overhead. To\nreduce our costs, in February 2015, we reduced our workforce and implemented certain other cost cutting measures. We also increased our legacy wireless inventory reserve by $58,000 during 2015, thus reducing this legacy inventory value to zero.\nResearch and development expenses relate to development of new wire products and new wire product manufacturing processes. In 2015, there were\nno new research and development efforts for our wireless commercial products. Research and development expenses totaled $4.1 million in 2015 compared to $6.0 million in 2014, a decrease of $1.9 million, or 32%. Our 2015 expenses were\nlower compared to 2014 as a result of our efforts moving from research and development to manufacturing of our new Conductus wire products.\nSelling, general and administrative expenses totaled $5.8 million in 2015 compared to $5.4 million in 2014, an increase of\n$0.4 million or 7%. The higher expenses in 2015 were primarily the result of higher\nnon-cash\nstock award expenses and were only partially offset by other cost saving efforts.\nWe had a gain from the adjustment to the fair value of warrant derivatives of $4.8 million in 2015 compared to a gain of\n$0.5 million in 2014. The primary reason for the gains was the drop in our stock price offset by the resulting effect of the reduction in the exercise price of certain warrants. This warrant liability is adjusted to fair value each reporting\nperiod, and any change in value is recognized in the statement of operations. In 2015, we also had a $0.5 million warrant revaluation expense from: (1) the revaluation of warrants just prior to their exercise due to the decrease in their\nexercise price; and (2) the revaluation of warrants due to our October 14, 2015 financing. See Note 5 \u0097 Stockholders\u0092 Equity.\nWarrants.\nInterest income decreased to less than a $1,000 in both 2015 and 2014, primarily because of lower cash levels earning less interest.\nOther income in 2015 and 2014 of $13,000 and $434,000, respectively, consisted of proceeds from the sale of equipment and expensed tooling\nrelated to our legacy wireless products.\nOther expense in 2015 of $207,000 consisted of charges associated with the early termination of\npart of our Santa Barbara facilities lease.\nNet loss totaled $8.6 million in 2015, compared to $8.3 million in 2014, an\nincrease of $0.3 million, or 4%. The increase in net loss was principally the result of our Conductus wire revenue being insufficient to cover our increased cost of commercial product revenues as we ramp production.\nThe net loss available to common stockholders totaled $6.55 per common share in 2015, compared to $9.67 per common share in 2014, a decrease\nof $3.12, or 32%.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nCash Flow Analysis\nAs of December 31, 2016, we had net working capital of $9.7 million, including $10.5 million in cash and cash equivalents,\ncompared to net working capital of $6.9 million at December 31, 2015, which included $7.5 million in cash and cash equivalents. We currently invest our excess cash in short-term, investment-grade, money-market instruments with\nmaturities of three months or less. Our investments have no exposure to the auction rate securities market.\nCash and cash equivalents\nincreased by $3 million from $7.5 million at December 31, 2015 to $10.5 million at December 31, 2016. In 2016, $8.1 million cash was used in operations. This use was offset by net cash proceeds of $11.1 million\nfrom the sale of our common shares and warrants.\n22\nTable of Contents\nIn 2016 and 2015, net cash used in investing activities was $0 and $140,000, respectively. Our\n2015 purchases of property and equipment of $141,000 were offset by $1,000 in sales.\nNet cash was provided by two financing activities in\n2016: (1) the August 2016, registered offering of 293,604 shares of our common stock, 1,294.595255 shares of our Series C Convertible Preferred Stock and 535,062 warrants provided gross proceeds of $2.2 million and, after deducting the\nplacement agent fees and our offering expenses, net proceeds of $1.9 million; and (2) the December 2016, registered direct offering of 1,798,787 shares of our common stock, 7,586.82 shares of our Series D Convertible Preferred Stock and\n6,856,667 warrants provided gross proceeds of $10.3 million and, after deducting the placement agent fees and our offering expenses, net proceeds of $9.2 million.\nFinancing Activities\nWe have\nhistorically financed our operations through a combination of cash on hand, equipment lease financings, available borrowings under bank lines of credit and both private and public equity offerings.\nNet cash was provided by two financing activities in 2016: (1) the August 2016, registered offering of 293,604 shares of our common stock,\n1,294.595255 shares of our Series C Convertible Preferred Stock and 535,062 warrants provided gross proceeds of $2.2 million and, after deducting the placement agent fees and our offering expenses, net proceeds of $1.9 million; and\n(2) the December 2016, registered direct offering of 1,798,787 shares of our common stock, 7,586.82 shares of our Series D Convertible Preferred Stock and 6,856,667 warrants provided gross proceeds of $10.3 million and, after deducting the\nplacement agent fees and our offering expenses, net proceeds of $9.2 million.\nNet cash was provided by three financing activities in\n2015: (1) the exercise of 61,124 outstanding warrants issued in connection with our August 2013 underwritten public offering provided gross proceeds of $1.8 million and net proceeds of $1.7 million in the first quarter of 2015; (2) the\nMarch 2015 direct sale of 204,186 shares of our common stock and 102,093 warrants provided net proceeds of $4.6 million; and (3) the October 2015, registered direct offering of 902,132 shares of our common stock, 4,750.0005 shares of our\nSeries B Convertible Preferred Stock and 3,162,066 warrants provided gross proceeds of $9.5 million and, after deducting the placement agent fees and our offering expenses, net proceeds of $8.6 million. For more detail of our 2016 and 2015\nfinancing activities see Note\n5-Stockholder\u0092s\nEquity.\nPublic Offerings,\nin this Report.\nDuring 2014, financing activities totaled $4.1 million from the exercise of 105,965 outstanding warrants issued in connection with the\nabove mentioned August 2013 offering.\nWe currently intend to use the net proceeds of these offerings for working capital and general\ncorporate purposes. General corporate purposes may include capital expenditures. In addition, we may use a portion of any net proceeds to acquire complementary products, technologies, or businesses.\nContractual Obligations and Commercial Commitments\nWe incur various contractual obligations and commercial commitments in our normal course of business. They consist of the following.\nOperating Lease Obligations.\nOur operating lease obligations consist of facilities leases in Austin, Texas, as well as several smaller\nequipment leases.\nPatents and Licenses.\nWe have entered into a licensing agreement requiring royalty payments ranging from 0.5% to\n1.0% of specified product sales. The agreement contains a provision for the payment of guaranteed or minimum royalty amounts. Typically, the licensor can terminate our license if we fail to pay minimum annual royalties.\n23\nTable of Contents\nPurchase Commitments.\nIn the normal course of business, we incur purchase obligations with\nvendors and suppliers for the purchase of inventory, as well as other goods and services. These obligations are generally evidenced by purchase orders that contain the terms and conditions associated with the purchase arrangements. We are committed\nto accept delivery of such material pursuant to the purchase orders subject to various contract provisions that allow us to delay receipt of such orders or cancel orders beyond certain agreed upon lead times. Cancellations may result in cancellation\ncosts payable by us.\nTabular Disclosure of Contractual Obligations.\nAt December 31, 2016, we had the following contractual\nobligations and commercial commitments.\nPayments Due by Period\nContractual Obligations\nTotal\n2017\n2018 and 2019\n2020 and 2021\n2022 and\nbeyond\nOperating leases\n$2,948,000\n$928,000\n$1,799,000\n$221,000\n$\u0097\nMinimum license commitment\n90,000\n45,000\n45,000\n\u0097\n\u0097\nFixed asset and inventory purchase commitments\n5,000\n5,000\n\u0097\n\u0097\n\u0097\nTotal contractual cash obligations\n$3,043,000\n$978,000\n$1,844,000\n$221,000\n$\u0097\nCapital Expenditures\nWe plan to invest in fixed assets during 2017 on an\nas-needed\nbasis to enhance manufacturing our\nConductus wire products. These expenditures are expected not to exceed $0.8 million.\nFuture Liquidity\nIn 2016, we incurred a net loss of $11.1 million and had negative cash flows from operations of $8.1 million. In 2015, we incurred a\nnet loss of $8.6 million and had negative cash flows from operations of $8.5 million. Our cash resources may not be sufficient to fund our business through March 30, 2018.    Therefore, unless we can materially\ngrow our revenues from commercial operations during such period, we will need to raise additional capital during the next\n12-months\nto continue to implement our current business plan and maintain our\nviability. Our independent registered public accounting firm has included in their audit reports for 2014 through 2016 an explanatory paragraph expressing substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern.\nAt December 31, 2016 we had $10.5 million in cash. We believe the key factors to our future liquidity will be our ability to\nsuccessfully use our expertise and our technology to generate revenues in various ways, including commercial operations, joint ventures, and licenses and we plan to leverage our leadership in superconducting technologies, extensive intellectual\nproperty, and HTS manufacturing expertise to develop and produce our Conductus wire.\nWe forecast that our existing cash resources will be\nsufficient to fund our planned operations into the first quarter of 2018. Unless we materially grow our revenues from commercial opportunities during 2017, we will need to raise additional capital to continue to implement our current business plan\nand maintain our viability.\nNet Operating Loss Carryforward\nAs of December 31, 2016, we had net operating loss carryforwards for federal and state income tax purposes of approximately\n$344.3 million and $119.6 million\n,\nrespectively, which expire in the years 2017 through 2036. Of these amounts, $77.5 million and $5.1 million, respectively, resulted from the acquisition of Conductus. Under the Internal\nRevenue Code change of control limitations, a maximum of $2.9 million and $2.8 million, respectively, will be available for reduction of future taxable income\n24\nTable of Contents\nDue to the uncertainty surrounding their realization, we have recorded a full valuation allowance\nagainst our net deferred tax assets. Accordingly, no deferred tax asset has been recorded in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets.\nSection 382 of the Internal Revenue Code imposes an annual limitation on the utilization of net operating loss carryforwards based on a\nstatutory rate of return (usually the \u0093applicable federal funds rate\u0094, as defined in the Internal Revenue Code) and the value of the corporation at the time of a \u0093change of ownership\u0094 as defined by Section 382. We had\nchanges in ownership in August 1999, December 2002, June 2009, August 2013 and December 2016. In addition, we acquired the right to Conductus\u0092 net operating losses, which are also subject to the limitations imposed by Section 382.\nConductus underwent five ownership changes, for purpose of this rule, which occurred in February 1999, February 2001, December 2002, June 2009, August 2013, and December 2016. Therefore, the ability to utilize Conductus\u0092 and our net operating\nloss carryforwards of $77.5 million and $266 million, respectively, which were incurred prior to the 2016 ownership changes, will be subject in future periods to annual limitations of $126,000. Net operating losses released from this\nlimitation and\/or incurred by us subsequent to the ownership changes and therefore not subject to this limitation totaled $430,000.\nMarket Risk\nWe are exposed to various market risks, including changes in interest rates. Market risk is the potential loss arising from adverse\nchanges in market rates and prices. We do not enter into derivatives or other financial instruments for trading or speculation purposes. Our money market investments have no exposure to the auction rate securities market.\nAt December 31, 2016, we had approximately $10.2 million invested in a money market account yielding approximately 0.13%. Assuming\nno yield on this money market account and no liquidation of principal for the year, our total interest income would decrease by less than $20,000 per annum.\nInflation\nWe do not foresee any material\nimpact on our operations from inflation.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nOur discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements, which\nhave been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. The preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts\nof assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. We continually evaluate our estimates, including those related to bad debts, inventories, recovery of long-lived assets, income taxes,\nwarranty obligations, contract revenue and contingencies. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making\njudgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Any future changes to these estimates and assumptions could cause a material change to our reported amounts of revenues, expenses, assets\nand liabilities. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions.\nOn July 19, 2016, we\neffected a\n1-for-15\nreverse stock split of our common stock, or the Reverse Stock Split. As a result of the Reverse Stock Split, every fifteen shares of our\npre-Reverse\nStock Split common stock were combined and reclassified into one share of our common stock. The Reverse Stock Split did not change the authorized number of shares or the par value of our common stock.\nCertain of the information contained in the documents incorporated by reference herein and therein present information on our common stock on a\npre-Reverse\nStock Split basis. Share and per share data included\nherein has been retroactively restated for the\n25\nTable of Contents\neffect of the Reverse Stock Split. In addition, we identified certain critical accounting policies which affect certain of our more significant estimates and assumptions used in preparing our\nconsolidated financial statements in this Annual Report on Form\n10-K\nfor 2016. We have not made any material changes to these policies.\nWe believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of the\nconsolidated financial statements. We maintain allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments. If the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate, resulting\nin an impairment of their ability to make payments, additional allowances may be required. We write down our inventory for estimated obsolescence or unmarketable inventory equal to the difference between the cost of inventory and the estimated\nmarket value based upon assumptions about future demand and market conditions. If actual market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management, additional inventory write-downs may be required.\nOur inventory is valued at the lower of its actual cost or the current estimated market value of the inventory. We review inventory quantities\non hand and on order and record, on a quarterly basis, a provision for excess and obsolete inventory and\/or vendor cancellation charges related to purchase commitments. If the results of the review determine that a write-down is necessary, we\nrecognize a loss in the period in which the loss is identified, whether or not the inventory is retained. Our inventory reserves establish a new cost basis for inventory and are not reversed until we sell or dispose of the related inventory. Such\nprovisions are established based on historical usage, adjusted for known changes in demands for such products, or the estimated forecast of product demand and production requirements. We recognize all manufacturing preproduction process development\nexpenses as cost of revenues in the period they are incurred. Our business is characterized by rapid technological change, frequent new product development and rapid product obsolescence that could result in an increase in the amount of obsolete\ninventory quantities on hand. Demand for our products can fluctuate significantly. Our estimates of future product demand may prove to be inaccurate, and we may understate or overstate the provision required for excess and obsolete inventory.\nOur net sales consist of revenue from sales of products, net of trade discounts and allowances. We recognize revenue when evidence of an\narrangement exists, contractual obligations have been satisfied, title and risk of loss have been transferred to the customer and collection of the resulting receivable is reasonably assured. At the time revenue is recognized, we provide for the\nestimated cost of product warranties if allowed for under contractual arrangements and return products. Our warranty obligation is affected by product failure rates and service delivery costs incurred in correcting a product failure. Should such\nfailure rates or costs differ from these estimates, accrued warranty costs would be adjusted.\nWe indemnify, without limit or term, our\ncustomers against all claims, suits, demands, damages, liabilities, expenses, judgments, settlements and penalties arising from actual or alleged infringement or misappropriation of any intellectual property relating to our products or other claims\narising from our products. We have no known losses and we cannot reasonably develop an estimate of the maximum potential amount of payments that might be made under our indemnities because of the uncertainty as to whether a claim might arise and how\nmuch it might total.\nContract revenues are principally generated under research and development contracts. Contract revenues are\nrecognized utilizing the\npercentage-of-completion\nmethod measured by the relationship of costs incurred to total estimated contract costs. If the current contract\nestimate were to indicate a loss, utilizing the funded amount of the contract, a provision would be made for the total anticipated loss. Contract revenues are derived primarily from research contracts with agencies of the United States Government.\nCredit risk related to accounts receivable arising from such contracts is considered minimal. These contracts include cost-plus, fixed price and cost sharing arrangements and are generally short-term in nature.\nAll payments to us for work performed on contracts with agencies of the U.S. Government are subject to adjustment upon audit by the Defense\nContract Audit Agency. Based on historical experience and review of\n26\nTable of Contents\ncurrent projects in process, we believe that the audits will not have a significant effect on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows. The Defense Contract Audit Agency has\naudited us through 2010.\nWe periodically evaluate the realizability of long-lived assets as events or circumstances indicate a possible\ninability to recover the carrying amount. Long-lived assets that will no longer be used in our business are written off in the period identified since they will no longer generate any positive cash flows for us. Such evaluation is based on various\nanalyses, including cash flow and profitability projections, as well as alternative uses, such as government contracts or awards. The analyses necessarily involve significant management judgment. In the event the projected undiscounted cash flows\nare less than net book value of the assets, the carrying value of the assets will be written down to their estimated fair value. Our future cash flows may vary from estimates.\nThe fair value of our warrant liabilities was determined using the binomial lattice valuation model, including an equal probabilities tree and\nan early exercise factor. These derivative liabilities are adjusted to reflect fair value at each period end, with any increase or decrease in the fair value recognized in our consolidated statement of operations.\nStock-based employee compensation cost is recognized using the fair-value based method for all awards granted. We issue stock option awards\nand restricted share awards to employees and to\nnon-employee\ndirectors under our stock-based incentive plans. The fair value of each option grant is estimated on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes\noption pricing model. Compensation cost related to restricted share awards is recorded based on the market price of our common stock on the grant date. We recognize compensation expense over the expected service period, generally the vesting period\non a straight-line basis from the grant date.\nOur valuation allowance against the deferred tax assets is based on our assessments of\nhistorical losses and projected operating results in future periods. If and when we generate future taxable income in the U.S. against which these tax assets may be applied, some portion or all of the valuation allowance would be reversed and an\nincrease in net income would consequently be reported in future years.","14":"","15":"","16":"","17":"","18":"","19":"","20":"","21":"","22":"","23":"","24":"ITEM 7. Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operation\nCritical Accounting Policies\nThe accounting and reporting policies of Patriot conform to accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (\u201cU.S. GAAP\u201d) and to general practices within the financial services industry. A summary of Patriot\u2019s significant accounting policies is included in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements that are referenced in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data. Although all of Patriot\u2019s policies are integral to understanding its Consolidated Financial Statements, certain accounting policies involve Management to exercise judgment, develop assumptions, and make estimates that may have a material impact on the financial information presented in the Consolidated Financial Statements or Notes thereto. The assumptions and estimates are based on historical experience and other factors representing the best available information to Management as of the date of the Consolidated Financial Statements, up to and including the date of issuance or availability for issuance. As the basis for the assumptions and estimates incorporated in the Consolidated Financial Statements may change, as new information comes to light, the Consolidated Financial Statements could reflect different assumptions and estimates.\nDue to the judgments, assumptions, and estimates inherent in the following policies, Management considers such accounting policies critical to an understanding of the Consolidated Financial Statements and Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.\nAllowance for Loan Losses (\u201cALL\u201d)\nThe Company maintains an ALL at a level management believes is sufficient to absorb estimated credit losses incurred as of the report date. Management\u2019\ns determination of the adequacy of the ALL is based on periodic evaluations of the loan portfolio and other relevant factors. However, this evaluation is inherently subjective as it requires significant estimates by management. As applicable, consideration is given to a variety of factors in establishing these estimates including historical losses, peer and industry data, current economic conditions, the size and composition of the loan portfolio, delinquency statistics, criticized and classified assets and impaired loans, results of internal loan reviews, borrowers\u2019\nperceived financial and management strengths, the adequacy of underlying collateral, the dependence on collateral, and the strength of the present value of future cash flows and other relevant factors. These factors may be susceptible to significant change.\nTo the extent actual outcomes differ from Management\u2019s estimates, additional provisions for loan losses may be required, which may adversely affect the Company\u2019s results of operations in the future. Subsequent to acquisition of purchased-credit-impaired loans, estimates of cash flows expected to be collected are updated each reporting period based on updated assumptions regarding default rates, loss severities, and other factors that are reflective of current market conditions. Subsequent decreases in expected cash flows will generally result in a provision for loan losses; subsequent increases in expected cash flows may result in a reversal of the provision for loan losses to the extent of prior charges.\n22\nUnrealized Gains and Losses on Securities Available-for-sale\nThe Company receives estimated fair values of debt securities from independent valuation services and brokers. In developing these fair values, the valuation services and brokers use estimates of cash flows based on historical performance of similar instruments in similar rate environments. Available-for-sale debt securities consist primarily of mortgage-backed securities that are guaranteed by the U.S. government. The Company uses various indicators in determining whether a security is other-than-temporarily impaired including, for debt securities, when it is probable that the contractual interest and principal will not be collected, or for equity securities, whether the market value is below its cost for an extended period of time with low expectation of recovery. The debt securities are monitored for changes in credit ratings because adverse changes in credit ratings could indicate a change in the estimated cash flows of the underlying collateral or issuer. For marketable equity securities, the Company considers the issuer\u2019\ns financial condition, capital strength, and near term prospects to determine whether impairment is temporary or other-than-temporary. The Company also considers the volatility of a security\u2019\ns price in comparison to the market as a whole and any recoveries or declines in fair value subsequent to the balance sheet date. If management determines that the impairment is other-than-temporary, the entire amount of the impairment, as of the balance sheet date, is recognized in earnings, even if the decision to sell the security has not been made. The fair value of the security becomes the new amortized cost basis of the investment and is not adjusted for subsequent recoveries in fair value. Available-for-sale debt securities were not considered to be other-than-temporarily impaired as of December 31, 2016, 2015, or 2014 because the unrealized losses were related to changes in interest rates and did not affect the expected cash flows to be received, or indicate a loss of value on the underlying collateral, or a loss of financial stability on the part of the issuer. Management concluded that the declines in fair value of the investment portfolio as of the reporting dates is temporary and that values would recover by way of increases in market price or positive changes in market interest rates.\nDeferred Income Taxes\nThe Company provides for deferred income taxes on the asset and liability approach, whereby a deferred tax liability or asset is recognized for the estimated future tax effect attributable to temporary differences or carryforwards. Temporary differences are the differences between the reported amounts of assets and liabilities in the financial statements and their tax basis. Deferred tax assets are reduced by a valuation allowance when, in the opinion of management, it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are adjusted for the effects of changes in tax laws and rates on the date of enactment.\n23\nFINANCIAL CONDITION\nAssets\nThe Company\u2019s total assets increased $103.3 million, or 15.8%, from $653.4 million at December 31, 2015 to $756.7 million at December 31, 2016. The growth in assets is primarily attributable to management\u2019s efforts to increase the amount and quality of its loan portfolio through its loan origination activities and by investing in quality loan pools, primarily funded through a growth in deposits.\nFollowing is a detailed discussion and analysis of events and transactions during the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015 and the impacts that have been realized with respect to Patriot\u2019s financial position.\n24\nCash and cash\ne\nquivalents\nCash and cash equivalents have increased $6.9 million or 8.1% as of December 31, 2016 compared to 2015 due to a number of factors including a decision to offer attractive yields on financial products to increase market share and build loyalty among depositors, continuing efforts to maintain and improve the operating cost saving initiatives that have produced positive results, and a debt issuance near year end that that allowed the Company to increase its investment in the Bank.\nInvestment\ns\necurities\nPatriot\u2019s investment security portfolio has decreased $5.0 million or 14.6% from December 31, 2015 to 2016. The decrease is due to the collection of the U.S. Government agency bonds held at December 31, 2015, which bonds were yielding less than 2% and were called during 2016.\nThe total investment among the other existing investment security classes, consisting of U.S. Government agency mortgage-backed securities, corporate bonds, and subordinated notes has remained stable. However, a redistribution of investment among these classes has occurred, in order to maximize returns. Specifically, the investment in Government agency mortgage-backed securities has decreased $2.97 million or 22%, corporate bonds has decreased $49,000 or 0.5%, and subordinated notes have increased $3.02 million or 151.3%. The management of the investment portfolio produced a $71,000 or 15% improvement in interest income earned in 2016 over 2015.\nLoans receivable, net\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2016, management implemented a strategy to increase its liquidity by aggressively marketing its products to depositors. Through its efforts, which were initiated late in the third quarter of 2016, management was able to generate approximately $84.7 million of liquidity that, coupled with other resources, allowed for a $97.8 million or 20.4% increase in loans receivable, net that is allocable to a $49.4 million or 550% increase in loan originations and a $52.0 million increase in loan pool purchases.\nThe increase in loans receivable, gross is attributable to the loan portfolio segments as follows.\n\u25cf\n$53.9 million or 113.5% increase in Consumer loans;\n\u25cf\n$38.3 million or 246.6% increase in Construction loans;\n\u25cf\n$25.4 million or 10.3% increase in Commercial Real Estate loans;\n\u25cf\n$2.7 million or 55.6% increase in Construction to permanent \u2013 CRE loans;\n\u25cf\n$1.2 million or 2% increase in Commercial and Industrial loans; and\n\u25cf\n$24.3 million or 21.9% decrease in Residential Real Estate loans.\nThe Residential Real estate loan portfolio segment is the only loan portfolio segment to experience a decrease that is primarily due to payoffs received. Management is also taking the strategic approach to focus its lending efforts on other loan portfolio segments.\nThe increase in loans receivable, net is further enhanced by improved quality in the originated loan portfolio as represented by a $567,000 or 10.8% decrease in the allowance for loan losses. This decrease resulted from a reserve and subsequent charge-off during 2016 of a single $3.0 million loan more fully described below that was offset by $149,000 in recoveries. Without the realized loss of the single loan, an improvement in the quality of loans receivable of $506,000 would have been recognized for the year ended December 31, 2016, rather than the $2.5 million provision for loan losses recognized in the results from operations.\n25\nAlthough the general quality of the loan portfolio has measurably improved, the Bank experienced one significant loan loss during the period which occurred in its Commercial and Industrial loan portfolio segment. The loan loss occurred in the year ended December 31, 2016, accounting for $3.0 million or 120.7% of the provision for loan losses recognized for the year ended December 31, 2016. The subject loan was charged off during the fourth quarter of 2016 in the approximate amount of $3.0 million, against which loss $2.8 million of insurance proceeds were received in the first quarter of 2017. Had the loan been performing in accordance with its contractual terms, the Bank would have recognized approximately $232,000 of additional interest income during the year ended December 31, 2016.\nOther than the single impaired loan experienced in 2016, impaired and non-accruing loans historically do not represent a significant impact to the Bank\u2019s loan portfolio. However, management is cognizant of the risk of extending credit to unworthy entities and, therefore, maintains strong credit approval processes to mitigate its risk.\nMaturities and Sensitivities of Loans to Changes in Interest Rates\nApproximately 63.0% of the loan portfolio is currently weighted towards long-term maturities five-years or more from December 31, 2016. The longer term of these loans provides a degree of stability to the Bank in managing its liquidity and concentrating its efforts on loan origination to higher quality, longer term relationships.\nAs a community bank, the Bank is invested in a thriving, robust local economy, which may be subject to the vagaries of general economic conditions, but which has maintained an above-national averages status with respect to capital investment. The existing conditions has led an investment in the loan portfolio weighted to Commercial Real Estate and Construction lending, which accounts for 55.9% of total loans receivable. These loans generally are collateralized by the underlying real estate and supported by personal guarantees of the borrowers.\nThe following table presents loans receivable, gross by portfolio segment, by contractual maturity as of December 31, 2016.\nContractual Maturity of Loan Balance\nOne year\nor less\nOne\nthrough\nFive Years\nAfter\nFive Years\nTotal\nLoan portfolio segment.\nCommercial Real Estate\n$70,461\n27,717\n173,051\n271,229\nResidential Real Estate\n6,153\n4,578\n75,783\n86,514\nCommercial and Industrial\n19,374\n28,154\n13,449\n60,977\nConsumer and Other\n501\n2,608\n98,340\n101,449\nConstruction\n39,640\n14,255\n-\n53,895\nConstruction to permanent - CRE\n$-\n1,986\n5,607\n7,593\nTotal\n136,129\n79,298\n366,230\n581,657\nFixed rate loans\n$54,655\n35,084\n74,621\n164,360\nVariable rate loans\n81,474\n44,214\n291,609\n417,297\nTotal\n$136,129\n79,298\n366,230\n581,657\n26\nVariable rate loans account for 71.7% of the total loan portfolio, which is attractive to the Bank in a period of increasing interest rates. $291.6 million or 69.9% of the variable rate loan portfolio matures in more than five years, which contributes a certain degree of stability to the Bank in managing both its interest rate risk and liquidity.\nPremises and equipment\nPatriot has undertaken a review and is in-process of realigning its market strategy to improve customer service and provide greater accessibility to depositors and prospective borrowers. In connection with its plan, management has initiated and is in-process of realigning its branch locations and corporate offices to improve penetration in targeted markets and utilize available properties to increase operating efficiencies and independence.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2016, construction-in-process has increased approximately $3 million or 87.6%, of which approximately $2.7 million or 91.2% is attributable to the build-out of the 999 Bedford Street, Stamford location that will be used to provide branch operations and house multiple corporate departments currently located in leased space. Construction-in-process has also been impacted by the renovation and build-out of a new branch location in Westport, CT located at 50 Charles Street that accounts for $0.2 million or 8.0% of the increase. Management anticipates completing construction in the second quarter of 2017, at which time the properties will be placed into service.\nOther Real Estate Owned (\u201cOREO\u201d)\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2016, one property was foreclosed upon and is held as OREO at December 31, 2016. On taking possession of the property in 2016, the Bank recognized an approximate $11,000 gain that represents the fair value of the property in excess of the carrying value of the loan.\nDeferred Taxes\nAs of December 31, 2016, Patriot has available approximately $45.9 million of Federal net operating loss carryforwards (\u201cNOL\u201d) that is offset by $30.6 million in \u00a7382 limitations imposed by the Internal Revenue Code. The $15.3 million of Federal NOLs are available to offset Patriot\u2019s taxable income for periods up to and through 2032, as these NOLs expire on various dates beginning in 2029.\nAdditionally, Patriot has approximately $64.8 million of NOLs available for Connecticut tax purposes, which may be used to offset up to 50% of taxable income in any year. The NOLs have an approximate fourteen year life.\nPatriot anticipates utilizing approximately $1.1 million of its tax-effected NOLs, in respect to its 2016 tax year.\nAs of December 31, 2016, Patriot had a $12.6 million deferred tax asset, comprised of multiple temporary differences, in addition to the previously aforementioned NOLs, which management believes will be fully realized in the future. The assessment of the potential relizability of the deferred tax assets is based on observation of the condition and future of the Bank, including.\n\u25cf\nFavorable financial performance over the past three years;\n\u25cf\nForecasted taxable income for 2017 and future periods;\n\u25cf\nThe growth in loan originations and the overall quality of the loan portfolio;\n\u25cf\nImprovements in operations and cost management; and\n\u25cf\nNet operating loss carry-forwards that do not begin to expire until 2029.\nThere is no guarantee that Patriot will realize the benefits of the NOLs in the future. As such, management continues to evaluate its ability to realize the benefits of the net deferred tax assets and will act accordingly if conditions change.\n27\nDeposits\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2016, total deposits increased by $84.7 million or 19.0% from the year ended December 31, 2015. The increase is substantially the result of a late third quarter and strong fourth quarter of 2016 effort by management to aggressively attract new depositors and strengthen the loyalty of the existing customer base by offering attractive interest rates compared to market. The effort is part of management\u2019s strategy to establish long-term relationships for sustained growth and profitability over short-term margins reflected in results. The long-term strategy is seen in the increase in interest expense on deposits of $0.2 million that is comparable to the $0.2 million decrease in advertising and marketing expense during the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to 2015.\nThe growth in deposits was virtually across all products offered by the Bank, except for non-interest bearing and money market accounts, which decreased by $9.0 million or 10.5% and $3.9 million or 20.1%, respectively from December 31, 2015. The decrease in non-interest bearing and money market accounts is emblematic of general market conditions and the rates of return offered by the financial services industry.\nGrowth in the all other deposit accounts may be summarized as.\n\u25cf\n$33.6 million or 191.7% increase in Certificates of deposit that are greater than $250,000;\n\u25cf\n$25.1 million or 23.7% increase in Savings accounts;\n\u25cf\n$21.2 million or 15.2% increase in Certificates of deposit that are less than $250,000;\n\u25cf\n$15.7 million or 32.8% increase in Brokered deposits; and\n\u25cf\n$2.0 million of 7.0% increase in NOW accounts.\nThe increase in deposits, most notably in the category of time certificates greater than $250,000 signifies the success of management in strengthening the Bank\u2019s liquidity by refocusing its operations on its customer base. The results of these efforts is easily viewed in comparison with the daily average balances that follow, which display a contrasting change in daily average balances of interest bearing deposits in virtually all categories.\nBorrowings\nPatriot\u2019s borrowings increased by approximately $17.5 million or 12.3% from December 31, 2015 to December 31, 2016. Borrowings consist primarily of FHLB advances, but also include senior notes, junior subordinated debentures, and a note payable to the seller from whom the Fairfield branch building was purchased in 2015.\nFHLB advances decreased by $9.0 million or 6.8% at December 31, 2016 compared to 2015, which decrease is primarily attributable to normal operations. The Bank maintains strong standing with the FHLB and its \u201cWell Capitalized\u201d designation with the FDIC, as provided below.\nIn December 2016, the Bank entered into a $16 million revolving line of credit agreement with a correspondent bank. The line of credit was obtained to provide short-term liquidity to satisfy overnight Fed account balance requirements and to provide for daily settlement of FRB, ACH, and other clearinghouse transactions. At December 31, 2016, $15.0 million was outstanding under the line of credit, which amount was repaid early in January 2017.\n28\nIn December 2016, the Company issued $12 million of 7% senior unsecured notes in a private placement to accredited institutional investors. The notes mature in December 2021, require the payment of interest on a semi-annual basis, require interest-only through maturity, and are neither callable by the Company nor putable by the holders. The Company used approximately $7.2 million of the proceeds from the note issuance to bolster its investment in the Bank, which capital contribution qualifies for Tier 1 Capital of the Bank.\nShareholders\u2019 Equity\nIn July 2016, the Company authorized a one-year stock repurchase program whereby management may repurchase up to 500,000 shares of common stock through July 2017. The program authorizes management, at the direction of the Company\u2019s chairman, to repurchase shares on the open-market or in private transactions, in accordance with applicable security laws and regulations.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2016, 72,471 shares of common stock were repurchased in a combination of open market and private transactions at an average cost of $14.04 per share or $1.0 million. The repurchased shares increased shares held in treasury from $0.2 million at December 31, 2015 to $1.2 million at December 31, 2016 or a 635.6% increase. Approximately 68,500 shares repurchased and entered into treasury relate to shares held by a former officer of the Company, which shares were repurchased at an average cost of $14.05. Management views the buy-back program as a valuable means to increase shareholder value through lowering the cost of capital and increasing the book value per share.\n29\nAverage Balances\nThe following table presents daily average balance sheets, interest income, interest expense and the corresponding yields earned and rates paid for each of the years in the three-year period ended December 31, 2016.\n(In thousands)\nYear ended December 31,\n2016\n2015\n2014\nDaily\nAverage\nBalance ($)\nInterest\n($)\nYield\n(%)\nDaily\nAverage\nBalance ($)\nInterest\n($)\nYield\n(%)\nDaily\nAverage\nBalance ($)\nInterest\n($)\nYield\n(%)\nASSETS\nInterest Earning Assets.\nLoans\n522,021\n24,391\n4.67\n492,245\n22,879\n4.65\n427,032\n19,601\n4.59\nCash equivalents\n33,411\n120\n0.36\n48,248\n102\n0.21\n42,405\n67\n0.16\nInvestments\n37,583\n897\n2.39\n44,427\n760\n1.71\n46,544\n700\n1.50\nTotal interest earning assets\n593,015\n25,408\n4.28\n584,920\n23,741\n4.06\n515,981\n20,368\n3.95\nCash and due from banks\n3,525\n2,623\n1,863\nAllowance for loan losses\n(6,238\n)\n(5,148\n)\n(5,277\n)\nOREO\n499\n-\n-\nOther assets\n47,501\n43,238\n46,636\nTotal Assets\n638,302\n625,633\n559,203\nLiabilities\nInterest bearing liabilities.\nTime certificates\n156,638\n1,103\n0.70\n180,910\n1,297\n0.72\n220,977\n2,014\n0.91\nSavings accounts\n127,238\n778\n0.61\n100,517\n489\n0.49\n88,008\n330\n0.37\nMoney market accounts\n17,989\n7\n0.04\n22,481\n10\n0.04\n27,144\n14\n0.05\nNOW accounts\n26,559\n8\n0.03\n29,027\n4\n0.01\n26,226\n4\n0.02\nBroker deposits\n47,950\n346\n0.72\n43,896\n216\n0.49\n682\n2\n0.29\nBorrowings\n110,319\n371\n0.34\n105,348\n368\n0.35\n79,216\n181\n0.23\nSenior notes\n319\n25\n7.84\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\nSubordinated debt\n8,248\n334\n4.05\n8,248\n294\n3.56\n8,248\n425\n5.15\nNote Payable\n1,852\n36\n1.94\n529\n12\n2.27\n-\n-\n-\nTotal interest bearing liabilities\n497,112\n3,008\n0.61\n490,956\n2,690\n0.55\n450,501\n2,970\n0.66\nDemand deposits\n75,311\n71,222\n57,850\nOther liabilities\n3,127\n3,060\n3,158\nTotal Liabilities\n575,550\n565,238\n511,509\nShareholders' equity\n62,752\n60,395\n47,694\nTotal Liabilities and Shareholders' Equity\n638,302\n625,633\n559,203\nNet interest income\n22,400\n21,051\n17,398\nInterest margin\n(1)\n3.78\n3.60\n3.37\nInterest spread\n3.68\n3.51\n3.29\n30\nThe following table presents the change in interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities by major category and the related change in the interest income earned and interest expense incurred thereon attributable to the change in transactional volume in the financial instruments and the rates of interest applicable thereto, comparing the years ended December 31, 2016 to 2015 and December 31, 2015 to 2014.\n(In thousands)\nYears ended December 31,\n2016 compared to 2015\n2015 compared to 2014\nIncrease\/(Decrease)\nIncrease\/(Decrease)\nDaily Average\nBalance\nVolume\nRate\nTotal\nDaily Average\nBalance\nVolume\nRate\nTotal\nInterest Earning Assets.\nLoans\n$29,776\n1,384\n128\n1,512\n65,213\n2,993\n285\n3,278\nCash equivalents\n(14,837\n)\n(31\n)\n49\n18\n5,843\n9\n26\n35\nInvestments\n(6,844\n)\n(117\n)\n254\n137\n(2,117\n)\n(32\n)\n92\n60\nTotal interest earning assets\n8,095\n1,236\n431\n1,667\n68,939\n2,971\n402\n3,373\nInterest bearing liabilities.\nTime certificates\n(24,272\n)\n(174\n)\n(20\n)\n(194\n)\n(40,067\n)\n(365\n)\n(352\n)\n(717\n)\nSavings accounts\n26,721\n130\n159\n289\n12,509\n47\n112\n159\nMoney market accounts\n(4,492\n)\n(2\n)\n(1\n)\n(3\n)\n(4,663\n)\n(2\n)\n(2\n)\n(4\n)\nNOW accounts\n(2,468\n)\n(0\n)\n4\n4\n2,801\n0\n(0\n)\n-\nBroker deposits\n4,054\n20\n110\n130\n43,214\n127\n87\n214\nBorrowings\n4,971\n17\n(14\n)\n3\n26,132\n60\n127\n187\nSenior notes\n319\n25\n-\n25\n-\n-\n-\n-\nSubordinated debt\n-\n-\n40\n40\n-\n-\n(131\n)\n(131\n)\nNote Payable\n1,323\n30\n(6\n)\n24\n529\n-\n-\n-\nTotal interest bearing liabilities\n6,156\n46\n272\n318\n40,455\n(134\n)\n(158\n)\n(292\n)\nNet increase (decrease)\n$1,939\n1,190\n159\n1,349\n28,484\n3,105\n560\n3,665\n31\nRESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nComparison of Results of Operations for the years 2016 and 2015\nFor the year ended December 31, 2016, the Company recorded net income of $1.9 million ($.49 per share) compared to a net income of $2.1 million ($0.55 per share) for the year ended December 31, 2015.\nIncome before tax expense was $3.1 million compared to 2015\u2019s income before income tax expense of $3.5 million. Highlights include.\n\u25cf\nInterest income increased $1.7 million;\n\u25cf\nNet interest income increased $1.3 million;\n\u25cf\nProvision for loan losses increased $2.2 million; and\n\u25cf\nNon-interest expense decreased $496,000.\nThe positive results for 2016 demonstrate the continued growth and success of the Company. 2016 was the third consecutive year of net profitability, which was primarily due to loan and deposit growth as well as balance sheet and operational efficiencies implemented during 2014, 2015 and 2016. These initiatives included.\n\u25cf\nTargeted lending opportunities and loan pool purchases.\n\u25cf\nReplacing high cost borrowings with lower rate funding.\n\u25cf\nStrategic repricing of deposits to target specific maturities.\n\u25cf\nStreamlining of branch and operational teams to improve efficiencies and costs.\n\u25cf\nNegotiating vendor price concessions.\n\u25cf\nThe purchase of three branch buildings where the benefits of owning outweigh the cost of leasing.\nNet interest Income\nNet interest income is the difference between interest income on interest earning assets and interest expense on interest-bearing liabilities. Net interest income depends on the relative amounts of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities and the interest rates earned or paid on them, respectively.\nNet interest income increased $1.3 million in 2016 over the previous year as focused growth and diversification in the loan portfolio yielded an increase in interest income.\nIn order to achieve this, the Bank originated $94.7 million in commercial real estate loans and $14.7 million in construction loans. Average loan balances were $29.8 million higher in 2016 than in 2015, as loan payoffs continued throughout 2016. Average yields on loans increased slightly to 4.67% from 4.65% in 2015 as the Bank operates in a very competitive market. Additionally, the Bank purchased two refinanced education loan pools totaling $52.0 million with a weighted average stated interest rate of approximately 5.3% from an originator who used targeted marketing to source qualified borrowers and applied strong credit standards similar to the Bank\u2019s credit guidelines.\nAverage yields on investment securities improved in 2016 to 2.39% from 1.71% in 2015 resulting in higher interest income of $137,000. This increase was primarily due to the purchase of subordinated bonds from two creditworthy financial institutions during 2016 each yielding 5% or greater. One government sponsored bond was called in 2016 which yielded under 2%.\nAs the loan pipeline began to grow during 2016, so did the need to increase the Bank\u2019s deposit base and liquidity sources. In the second half of 2016, the Bank initiated a certificate of deposits (CD) program to attract term deposits at competitive rates. The program was successful and achieved over $50 million in CDs in just five months. The average term of the new CDs was 15 months.\nTotal deposit interest expense increased $226,000 to $2.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. This increase was related to the deposit initiative as well as the increase in the use of broker deposits as a funding source. The average rate on interest bearing deposits increased from 54.8 basis points in 2015 to 55.3 basis points in 2016.\n32\nInterest expense on borrowings increased $92,000 from 2015. Interest expense on subordinated debt increased $40,000 from 2015, primarily due to incremental increase in three month LIBOR throughout 2016 which is the index this coupon is based upon.\nIn December 2016, the Company completed the issuance, through a private placement, of $12 million aggregate principal amount of 7.0% fixed senior unsecured notes due December 22, 2021 (the \u201cNotes\u201d). The Company intends to use the proceeds of this offering for general corporate purposes, which will include advances to the Bank to finance growth activities. In December, the Company advanced $7.2 million to the Bank which qualifies as Tier 1 capital.\nThe Notes were issued pursuant to a Purchase Agreement, dated as of December 22, 2016, between the Company and accredited institutional investors. The Notes bear a fixed interest rate of 7.00% per annum from and including December 22, 2016 to but excluding December 22, 2021 and are payable semi-annually in arrears on June 22 and December 22 of each year, beginning June 22, 2017. The Notes are not subject to redemption at the option of the Company. Principal and interest on the Notes are subject to acceleration only in limited circumstances. The senior notes issued increased interest expense by $25,000 in 2016.\nManagement regularly reviews loan and deposit rates and strives to price the Bank\u2019s products competitively. The Bank tracks its mix of asset and liability maturities and manages its balance sheet in an effort to maintain a reasonable maturity match, between the two.\nProvision for loan losses\nIn 2016, loans outstanding grew $98 million over 2015 after loan payoffs and paydowns. With the exception of one commercial loan, the performance and credit quality of the portfolio continues to strengthen. In the second half of 2016, the Bank determined that an increase the loan loss reserve for one specific loan was required due to information and further analysis regarding the full collectability of this loan. To fully reserve for this loan, the Bank recognized a $3.0 million provision for loan losses in the year ended December 31, 2016, consisting of a $1 million provision in the first quarter of 2016 and an additional provision of $2 million in the second quarter of 2016, when it became clear that a total loss on the loan was imminent.\nDespite the Bank\u2019s position that this loan should be fully reserved as of December 31, 2016, the Bank commenced recovery actions across all available avenues, including insurance coverage and claims against third parties. Potential insurance coverage, under which the Bank has sought recovery, includes a Financial Institution Bond with a limit of liability of $5,000,000 above a $50,000 deductible. The Bank has vigorously pursued its avenues of recovery, including insurance coverage and third party claims.\nIn March 2017, the Bank received $2.8 million of insurance proceeds against the loss recognized on the subject loan.\nNon-interest income\nNon-interest income of $1.6 million was recorded for 2016 and was consistent with the results of 2015. This category includes loan fees, deposit service charges, rental income and miscellaneous income. In 2015, non-interest income totaled $1.6 million.\n33\nNon-interest expense\nIn 2016, the Company continued its efforts of monitoring and controlling costs. Vendor management and evaluations were conducted in order to make certain the quality, level of service and expense expectations of vendors were in line with contractual agreements, some employee benefit costs were reduced, or in some cases, benefits modified to prevent future cost increases, and office occupancy costs were re-examined. Non-interest expense decreased $496,000, or 2.6%, to $18.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2016.\nAs the Bank grew in 2016, additional client facing and support team members were necessary. As such, salary and related benefit costs increased by $810,000. However, incentive savings of $176,000 and an increase in deferred loan costs credit of $340,000, due to the increase in loans originated in 2016, offset some of this additional staff expense.\nThe 2016 full year impact of relocating into new branches in 2015 benefited occupancy costs with approximately $350,000 in expense reductions. In 2015, there was a non-cash charge of $133,000 associated with the abandonment of leasehold improvements relating to the Fairfield branch building. There were no similar charges recorded in 2016.\nIn discussions with one of the Bank\u2019s data system providers, the Bank was able to negotiate specific terms to include offsetting future credits for services provided. In 2016, $150,000 in credits was applied to some invoices.\nProfessional and other outside services increased $91,000 primarily due to legal fees resulting from the recovery actions taken in 2016 with regards to the one commercial loan mentioned above in the \u201cProvision for Loan Losses\u201d section.\nAdvertising and promotional expense decreased approximately $200,000 relating to the Bank\u2019s change in its service providers and its focus on specific initiatives.\nComparison of Results of Operations for the years 2015 and 2014\nFor the year ended December 31, 2015, the Company recorded net income of $2.1 million ($.55 per share) compared to a net income of $15.7 million ($4.08 per share) for the year ended December 31, 2014.\nIncome before income tax expense was $3.5 million, an increase of $2.5 million compared to income before income tax expense of $1.0 million in 2014.\n\u25cf\nNet interest income increased $3.7 million;\n\u25cf\nProvision for loan losses increased $250,000;\n\u25cf\nNon-interest income decreased $281,000; and\n\u25cf\nNon-interest expense increased $580,000.\nThe positive results for 2015 were primarily due to balance sheet and operational restructuring initiatives implemented during 2013, 2014 and 2015 by the new executive management team. These initiatives included.\n\u25cf\nReplacement of high cost borrowings at significantly lower rates.\n\u25cf\nStrategic repricing of deposits.\n\u25cf\nStreamlining of branch and back office operations and exiting the Residential Lending business, resulting in non-interest expense reductions.\n\u25cf\nNegotiating vendor price concessions.\n\u25cf\nPurchasing three branch buildings where the cost of the leases exceeded the cost to own the properties.\n34\nThe Company\u2019s improved earnings and balance sheet resulting from the initiatives noted and continued drive for efficiencies enabled the Company to recognize a $16.8 million income tax benefit in the third quarter of 2014 via reversal of most of the valuation allowance against its Deferred Tax Asset (\u201cDTA\u201d). Recognition of the DTA increased regulatory capital, enabling The Company to increase its asset base.\nNet interest Income\nNet interest income is the difference between interest income on interest earning assets and interest expense on interest-bearing liabilities. Net interest income depends on the relative amounts of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities and the interest rates earned or paid on them, respectively.\nNet interest income increased $3.7 million from $17.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2014 to $21.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2015.\n\u25cf\nTotal interest and dividend income increased $3.4 million, or 16.6%, primarily as a result of higher average loan balances.\n-\nAverage loan balances were $65.2 million higher in 2015 than in 2014, including an increase in the average commercial and commercial real estate loan balance of $57.7 million. The increase in average loan balances resulted in higher interest income of $3.3 million.\n-\nAverage yields on loans increased to 4.65% from 4.59% in 2014. This benefitted interest income by $320,000 and was largely derived from loan mix as lower yielding residential loans constituted a smaller portion of the average loan portfolio in 2015.\n-\nAverage yields on investments increased to 1.71% from 1.50% in 2014 resulting in higher interest income of $61,000. The increase in yields was primarily due to the purchase of a subordinated bond during 2015.\n\u25cf\nTotal interest expense decreased $280,000 from $3.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2014 to $2.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 as average deposit and debt rates were lower in 2015.\n-\nDeposit expense decreased $348,000 primarily due to the maturity and roll off of higher rate time deposits and replacement of these with lower rates. The average rate on these interest bearing Time Certificates deposits decreased from 0.91% to 0.67% in 2015, resulting in a $532,000 decrease in interest expense, offset by increase in Savings accounts by $159,000. Average time deposits were $3.2 million higher than 2014.\n-\nInterest expense on borrowings increased $187,000 from 2014. The average rate on borrowings increased from 0.23% to 0.35% in 2015, resulting in a $0.2 million increase in interest expense. Average borrowings increased $26.1 million from 2014.\n-\nInterest expense on subordinated debt decreased $131,000 from 2014, primarily due to incremental expense of $117,000 that was avoided due to payment of previously deferred prior year interest payments.\n-\nInterest expense of $12,000 was incurred on a promissory note issued to the seller of a branch building acquired by Patriot in 2015.\nManagement regularly reviews loan and deposit rates and strives to price The Company\u2019s products competitively. The Company tracks its mix of asset and liability maturities and manages its balance sheet in an effort to maintain a reasonable maturity match, between the two.\n35\nProvision for loan losses\nDuring 2015, the Company recorded a $250,000 provision for loan losses in the first quarter due to the growth of the loan portfolio. As the year progressed, loan originations were partial offset by loan payoffs. Overall, the credit quality of the loan portfolio continues to improve as the amount of classified assets outstanding has declined and the overall risk rating for the portfolio has improved which has enabled the Company to maintain its loan loss reserve level with no additional provision requirements for the remainder of 2015.\nNon-interest income\nNon-interest income decreased by $281,000, or 15.3%, from $1.8 million in 2014 to $1.6 million in 2015. Non-interest income for 2014 included a $455,000 loss on disposition of the Bank\u2019s BOLI policy, offset by $439,000 earnings on cash surrender value of the Bank\u2019s Policy. Lower deposit fees and service charges of $284,000 in 2015 are primarily due to lower overdraft fees as a result of closing frequently overdrawn accounts due to credit risk reasons.\nPartially offsetting the noted changes was incremental rental income of approximately $47,000.\nNon-interest expense\nNon-interest expense increased $580,000, or 3.2%, from $18.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2014 to $18.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2015. Non-interest expense in 2014 included expense of $437,000 related to tax penalty for disposition of the BOLI policy. Non- interest expense in 2015 included the following differences.\n\u25cf\nSalaries and benefits were increased by $1.2 million, primarily due to personnel increases to support the Company\u2019s growth.\n\u25cf\nProfessional and other outside services decreased $656,000 primarily due to lower legal fees resulting from improved asset quality, renegotiation of several vendor contracts and reduced consultant usage.\n\u25cf\nRegulatory assessments reduction of $276,000 primarily due to improved ratings.\n\u25cf\nAdvertising and promotional expense increased $339,000 primarily due to the Company changing its overall business strategy and focus as the Bank changed its name and redefined its approach to the way it provides value to its customers, community and the market place.\n\u25cf\nYear ended 2015, also includes a $133,000 non-cash charge, primarily associated with the abandonment of leasehold improvements in conjunction with the purchase of the Company\u2019s Fairfield branch building.\n36\nLIQUIDITY\nPatriot\u2019s liquidity position was 14.9% and 16.7% at December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively. The liquidity ratio is defined as the ratio of liquid assets to total assets. The following categories of assets as described in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets are considered liquid assets: cash and due from banks, federal funds sold (if any), short-term investments (if any) and available-for-sale securities which have not been pledged. Liquidity is a measure of Patriot\u2019s ability to generate adequate cash to meet its financial obligations.\nThe principal cash requirements of the Bank are to cover increases in its loan portfolio and downward fluctuations in deposit accounts. Management believes that Patriot\u2019s liquid assets provide sufficient coverage to satisfy loan demand, cover potential fluctuations in deposit accounts, and to meet other anticipated operational cash requirements.\nAt December 31, 2016, cash and cash equivalents and unpledged available-for-sale securities amounted to $92.3 million and $20.2 million, respectively.\nAt December 31, 2016, the Bank had additional borrowing capacity of $16.2 million available from FHLB Boston, which is comprised of $14.2 million of advances and a $2.0 million overnight line of credit. These amounts are in addition to the FHLB advances of $123 million that are outstanding at December 31, 2016. Additionally, the Bank has the ability to borrow from the FRB.\nAs of December 31, 2016, the maturities of Patriot\u2019s contractual obligations are as follows.\n(In thousands)\nContractual Obligations Due\nContractual Obligation Catgegory\nLess than\nOne Year\nOne to\nThree Years\nThree to\nFive Years\nOver\nFive\nYears\nTotal\nCertificates of deposit\n$144,323\n65,232\n2,131\n-\n211,686\nFederal Home Loan Bank borrowings\n58,000\n-\n65,000\n-\n123,000\nBrokered deposits\n63,932\n-\n-\n-\n63,932\nCorrespondent bank - line of credit\n15,000\n-\n-\n-\n15,000\nSenior notes\n-\n-\n12,000\n-\n12,000\nJunior subordinated debt\n-\n-\n-\n8,248\n8,248\nNote payable\n189\n387\n401\n792\n1,769\nOperating lease obligations\n560\n317\n123\n172\n1,172\nTotal contractual obligations\n$282,004\n65,936\n79,655\n9,212\n436,807\n37\nOFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS\nThe Bank\u2019s off-balance sheet commitments generally have fixed expiration dates or other termination clauses and may require payment of a fee by the borrower. Since these commitments could expire without being drawn upon or are contingent upon the customer adhering to the terms of the agreements, the total commitment amounts do not necessarily represent future cash requirements. As of December 31, 2016, the Bank\u2019s off-balance sheet commitments are as follows.\n(In thousands)\nAs of December 31, 2016\nCommitments to extend credit.\nUnused lines of credit\n$39,063\nUndisbursed construction loans\n21,224\nHome equity lines of credit\n20,846\nFuture loan commitments\n15,755\nFinancial standby letters of credit\n1,482\n$98,370\nREGULATORY CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS\nThe following tables illustrate the Company\u2019s and the Bank\u2019s regulatory capital ratios at December 31, 2016 and 2015.\n(In thousands)\nAs of December 31,\nPatriot National Bancorp, Inc.\nPatriot Bank, N.A.\n2016\n2015\n2016\n2015\nAmount\n($)\nRatio\n(%)\nAmount\n($)\nRatio\n(%)\nAmount\n($)\nRatio\n(%)\nAmount\n($)\nRatio\n(%)\nTotal Capital (to risk weighted assets)\n66,254\n10.603\n64,845\n12.622\n74,303\n11.928\n65,207\n12.742\nTier 1 Capital (to risk weighted assets)\n61,571\n9.854\n59,595\n11.600\n69,620\n11.176\n59,958\n11.716\nCommon Equity Tier 1 Capital (to risk weighted assets)\n53,571\n8.573\n51,595\n10.043\n69,620\n11.176\n59,958\n11.716\nTier 1 Leverage Capital (to average assets)\n61,571\n9.296\n59,595\n9.769\n69,620\n10.518\n59,958\n9.832\nCapital adequacy is one of the most important factors used to determine the safety and soundness of individual banks and the banking system. Under the regulatory framework for prompt correction action, to be considered \u201cwell capitalized,\u201d an institution must generally have a leverage capital ratio of at least 5.0%, Common Equity Tier 1 capital ratio at least 6.5%, a Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of at least 8.0% and a total risk-based capital ratio of at least 10%. However, the OCC has the discretion to require increased capital ratios.\nUnder the final capital rules that became effective on January 1, 2015, there is a requirement for a CET1 Capital conservation buffer of 2.5% of risk-weighted assets, which is in addition to the other minimum risk-based capital standards in the rule. Institutions that do not maintain this required capital buffer become subject to progressively more stringent limitations on the percentage of earnings that may be distributed to shareholders or used for stock repurchases and on the payment of discretionary bonuses to senior executive management.\nThe capital buffer requirement is being phased in over three years beginning in 2016. The 0.625% capital conservation buffer increase for 2016 has been included in the minimum capital adequacy ratios in the table above. The capital buffer requirement effectively raises the minimum required Total Capital ratio to 10.5%, the Tier 1 Capital ratio to 8.5%, and the CET1 Capital ratio to 7.0% on a fully phased-in basis, which will be effective beginning on January 1, 2019. Management believes that, as of December 31, 2016, Patriot satisfies all capital adequacy requirements under the Basel III Capital Rules on a fully phased-in basis, as if all such requirements were currently in effect.\nManagement continuously assesses the adequacy of the Bank\u2019s capital with the goal to maintain a \u201cwell capitalized\u201d classification.\n38","25":"","26":"","27":"ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND\nANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nThe following discussion of our financial\ncondition and results of operations for the years ended December 31, 2016 and December 31, 2015 should be read in conjunction with\nthe financial statements and the notes to those statements that are included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Our\ndiscussion includes forward-looking statements based upon current expectations that involve risks and uncertainties, such as our\nplans, objectives, expectations and intentions. Actual results and the timing of events could differ materially from those anticipated\nin these forward-looking statements as a result of a number of factors. We use words such as \u201canticipate\u201d, \u201cestimate\u201d,\n\u201cplan\u201d, \u201cproject\u201d, \u201ccontinuing\u201d, \u201congoing\u201d, \u201cexpect\u201d, \u201cbelieve\u201d,\n\u201cintend\u201d, \u201cmay\u201d, \u201cwill\u201d, \u201cshould\u201d, \u201ccould\u201d, and similar expressions\nto identify forward-looking statements.\nOVERVIEW\nWe are a life science company with two\ndistinct business segments. Our specialty pharmaceutical segment is focused on developing and commercializing novel therapeutics\nutilizing synthetic CBD. Our consumer product segment is focused on manufacturing, marketing and selling plant-based CBD products\nto a range of market sectors. On June 8, 2016, the Company changed its trading symbol from CANV to CVSI, and continues to be traded\non the OTC: QB.\nOur specialty pharmaceutical business segment\nis developing synthetic cannabinoids to treat a range of medical conditions. The Company\u2019s product candidates are based on\nproprietary formulations, processes and technology that we believe are patent-protectable, and we plan to vigorously pursue patent\nprotection on the Company\u2019s two drug candidates.\nOur consumer product business segment manufactures,\nmarkets and sells consumer products containing plant-based CBD under our\nPlusCBDTM\nbrand in a range of market sectors\nincluding nutraceutical, beauty care, specialty foods and vape.\nWe expect to realize revenue from our consumer\nproducts business segment to fund a portion of our working capital needs. However, in order to fund our pharmaceutical product\ndevelopment efforts, we will need to raise additional capital either through the issuance of equity and\/or the issuance of debt.\nGiven the small size of our company and the development stage of our specialty pharmaceutical business segment, we may find it\ndifficult to raise sufficient capital to meet our needs. We do not have any firm commitments for all of our capital needs, and\nthere are no assurances they will be available to us.\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures\nWe currently focus on Adjusted EBITDA\nto evaluate our business relationships and our resulting operating performance and financial position. Adjusted EBITDA is\ndefined by us as EBITDA (net income (loss) minus interest income, plus interest expense, income tax expense, depreciation and\namortization), further adjusted to exclude certain non-cash expenses and other adjustments as set forth below. We present\nAdjusted EBITDA because we consider it an important measure of our performance and it is a meaningful financial metric in\nassessing our operating performance from period to period by excluding certain items that we believe are not representative\nof our core business, such as certain non-cash items and other adjustments.\nWe believe that Adjusted EBITDA, viewed\nin addition to, and not in lieu of, our reported results in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United\nStates (\u201cGAAP\u201d), provides useful information to investors regarding our performance for the following reasons.\n\u00b7\nbecause non-cash equity grants made to employees and non-employees at a certain price and\npoint in time do not necessarily reflect how our business is performing at any particular time. As such, we do not believe stock-based\ncompensation expense is a key measure of our operating performance; and\n\u00b7\nrevenues and expenses associated with acquisitions, dispositions, equity issuance and related offering costs can vary from period to period and transaction to transaction and are not considered a key measure of our operating performance.\nWe used Adjusted EBITDA.\n\u00b7\nas a measure of operating performance;\n\u00b7\nto evaluate the effectiveness of our business strategies; and\n\u00b7\nin communication with our Board of Directors concerning our financial performance.\n7\nAdjusted EBITDA is a non-GAAP measure\nand does not purport to be an alternative to net income (loss) as a measure of operating performance or to cash flows from\noperating activities as a measure of liquidity. The term Adjusted EBITDA is not defined under GAAP, and Adjusted EBITDA is\nnot a measure of net income (loss), operating income or any other performance measure derived in accordance with GAAP.\nAdjusted EBITDA has limitations as an analytical\ntool and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of our results as reported under GAAP. Some of these\nlimitations are.\n\u00b7\nAdjusted EBITDA does not reflect all cash expenditures, future requirements for capital expenditures or contractual requirements;\n\u00b7\nAdjusted EBITDA does not reflect changes in, or cash requirements for, working capital needs; and\n\u00b7\nAdjusted EBITDA\ncan differ significantly from company to company depending on that Company\u2019s definition of Adjusted EBITDA, strategic\ndecisions     regarding     capital     structure, the tax     jurisdictions in which companies operate and the level of\ncapital     investment, thus,     limiting is     usefulness as a comparative     measure.\nAdjusted EBITDA should not be considered\nas a measure of discretionary cash available to us for investment in our business. We compensate for these limitations by relying\nprimarily on GAAP results and using Adjusted EBITDA as supplemental information.\nA reconciliation from our net loss to Adjusted\nEBITDA, a non-GAAP measure, for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015 is detailed below.\nFor the years ended December 31,\n2016\n2015\nNet loss\n$(14,141,298\n)\n$(12,233,128\n)\nInterest income\n(27,658\n)\n(18,287\n)\nInterest expense\n1,086,793\n968,615\nAmortization of purchased intangible assets\n857,400\n822,000\nDepreciation of property & equipment\n195,167\n190,335\nEBITDA\n(12,029,596\n)\n(10,270,465\n)\nEBITDA Adjustments.\nStock-based compensation expense (1)\n3,274,034\n6,048,193\nLitigation settlement income (2)\n\u2013\n(756,714\n)\nGain on collection of related party notes receivable (3)\n(379,486\n)\n\u2013\nGain on change in derivative liability (4)\n(147,200\n)\n\u2013\nImpairment of inventory (5)\n3,562,459\n\u2013\nImpairment of PhytoSPHERE goodwill and intangible assets (6)\n2,746,512\n\u2013\nBad debt expense (7)\n\u2013\n2,654,836\nTotal EBITDA Adjustments\n9,056,319\n7,946,315\nAdjusted EBITDA\n$(2,973,277\n)\n$(2,324,150\n)\n_________________\n(1)\nRepresents\nstock-based compensation expense related to stock options and warrants awarded to employees, consultants and non-executive\ndirectors based on the grant date fair value using the Black-Scholes valuation\nmodel.\n(2)\nRepresents income from settlement with Medical Marijuana, Inc.

On an ongoing basis management evaluates its critical accounting policies and estimates.\n8\nA \u201ccritical accounting policy\u201d\nis one which is both important to the understanding of the financial condition and results of operations of the Company and requires\nmanagement\u2019s most difficult, subjective, or complex judgments, and often requires management to make estimates about the\neffect of matters that are inherently uncertain. Management believes the following accounting policies fit this definition.\nDerivative Financial\nInstruments\n- Derivative financial instruments are initially recognized at fair value on the date a derivative\ncontract is entered into and are subsequently remeasured at fair value on a quarter-end reporting basis. Changes in the fair\nvalue of derivative financial instruments are recognized as a gain or loss in the Company\u2019s Consolidated Statements of\nOperations.\nBusiness Combinations\n-\nWe\napply the provisions of the Accounting Standards Codification (\u201cASC\u201d) Topic 805,\nBusiness Combinations\n(\u201cASC\n805\u201d), in the accounting for our acquisitions, including without limitation, the CanX Acquisition. ASC 805 establishes principles\nand requirements for recognizing and measuring the total consideration transferred to and the assets acquired, liabilities assumed\nand any non-controlling interests in the acquired target in an asset purchase. ASC 805 requires us to recognize separately from\ngoodwill the assets acquired and the liabilities assumed at the acquisition date fair values. Goodwill as of the acquisition date\nis measured as the excess of consideration transferred over the net of the acquisition date fair values of the assets acquired\nand the liabilities assumed. While we use our best estimates and assumptions to accurately value assets acquired and liabilities\nassumed at the acquisition date as well as contingent consideration, where applicable, our estimates are inherently uncertain and\nsubject to refinement. As a result, during the measurement period, we record adjustments to the assets acquired and liabilities\nassumed with the corresponding offset to goodwill. Upon the conclusion of the measurement period or final determination of the\nvalues of assets acquired or liabilities assumed, whichever comes first, any subsequent adjustments are recorded in our consolidated\nstatements of operations.\nAccounting for business combinations requires\nour management to make significant estimates and assumptions, especially at the acquisition date, including our estimates for intangible\nassets, contractual obligations assumed, pre-acquisition contingencies and contingent consideration, where applicable. Although\nwe believe the assumptions and estimates we have made in the past have been reasonable and appropriate, they are based in part\non historical experience and information obtained from the management of the acquired companies and are inherently uncertain.\nExamples of critical estimates in valuing\ncertain of the intangible assets we have acquired include but are not limited to.\n\u00b7\nfuture expected cash flows from supply chain relationships with growers and processors of our hemp extracted CBD oil;\n\u00b7\nexpected costs to develop the in-process research and development (\u201cIPR&D\u201d) into commercially viable pharmaceutical products and estimated cash flows from the projects when completed;\n\u00b7\nthe acquired company\u2019s brand, trade names and competitive position, as well as assumptions about the period of time the acquired brand will continue to be used in the combined Company\u2019s product portfolio; and\n\u00b7\ndiscount rates.\nChange in Accounting Policy\n\u2013\nDuring the first quarter of fiscal year 2016, the Company changed its accounting policy for shipping and handling costs from sales\nof Company products. Under the new accounting policy, these costs are included in cost of goods sold, whereas, they were previously\nincluded in selling, general and administrative expenses. Including these expenses in cost of goods sold better aligns these costs\nwith the related revenue in the gross profit calculation.\nThe Consolidated Statement of Operations\nfor the year ended December 31, 2015 has been reclassified to reflect this change in accounting policy. The impact of this reclassification\nwas an increase of $377,316 to cost of goods sold for the year ended December 31, 2015 and a corresponding decrease to selling,\ngeneral and administrative expenses in the same period. This accounting policy change has been applied retrospectively and had\nno impact on Net Sales, Operating Loss, Net Loss or Net Loss per Share.\nGoodwill and Intangible Assets \u2013\nThe Company evaluates the carrying value of goodwill and intangible assets annually during the fourth quarter in accordance\nwith ASC Topic 350,\nIntangibles Goodwill and Other\nand between annual evaluations if events occur or circumstances change\nthat would more likely than not reduce the fair value of the reporting unit below its carrying amount. Such circumstances could\ninclude, but are not limited to (1) a significant adverse change in legal factors or in business climate, (2) unanticipated competition,\nor (3) an adverse action or assessment by a regulator. When evaluating whether goodwill is impaired, the Company compares the fair\nvalue of the reporting unit to which the goodwill is assigned to the reporting unit\u2019s carrying amount, including goodwill.\nThe fair value of the reporting unit is estimated using a combination of the income, or discounted cash flows, approach and the\nmarket approach, which utilizes comparable companies\u2019 data. If the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value,\nthen the amount of the impairment loss must be measured. The impairment loss would be calculated by comparing the implied fair\nvalue of a reporting unit\u2019s goodwill to its carrying amount. In calculating the implied fair value of a reporting unit\u2019s\ngoodwill, the fair value of the reporting unit is allocated to all of the other assets and liabilities of that unit based on their\nfair values. The excess of the fair value of a reporting unit over the amount assigned to its other assets and liabilities is the\nimplied fair value of goodwill.\n9\nWe make critical assumptions and estimates\nin completing impairment assessments of goodwill and other intangible assets. Our cash flow projections look several years into\nthe future and include assumptions on variables such as future sales and operating margin growth rates, economic conditions, market\ncompetition, inflation and discount rates.\nWe classify intangible assets into three\ncategories: (1) intangible assets with definite lives subject to amortization; (2) intangible assets with indefinite lives not\nsubject to amortization; and (3) goodwill. We determine the useful lives of our identifiable intangible assets after considering\nthe specific facts and circumstances related to each intangible asset. Factors we consider when determining useful lives include\nthe contractual term of any agreement related to the asset, the historical performance of the asset, our long-term strategy for\nusing the asset, any laws or regulations which could impact the useful life of the asset and other economic factors, including\ncompetition and specific market conditions. Intangible assets that are deemed to have definite lives are amortized, primarily on\na straight-line basis, over their useful lives to their estimated residual values, generally five years. IPR&D\nhas an indefinite life and is not amortized until completion and development of the project, at which time the IPR&D becomes\nan amortizable asset. If the related project is not completed in a timely manner or the project is terminated or abandoned, the\nCompany may have an impairment related to the IPR&D, calculated as the excess of the asset\u2019s carrying value over its\nfair value. This method of amortization approximates the expected future cash flow generated from their use. During the year ended\nDecember 31, 2016, an impairment expense of $2,746,512 was recorded related to the PhytoSPHERE acquired goodwill and intangible\nassets (See Note 7 of the Company\u2019s consolidated financial statements). No impairments were noted during the year ended December 31, 2015.\nAccounts receivable\n-\nGenerally, the Company requires payment prior to shipment. However, in certain circumstances, the Company extends credit to\ncompanies located throughout the U.S. Accounts receivable consists of trade accounts arising in the normal course of\nbusiness. Accounts receivable for large accounts are generally secured by substantially all assets of the customer. Smaller account\nreceivables, generally less than $10,000, are unsecured and interest is charged on past due accounts. Accounts for which no\npayments have been received after 30 days are considered delinquent and customary collection efforts are initiated. Accounts\nreceivable are carried at original invoice amount less a reserve made for doubtful receivables based on a review of all\noutstanding amounts on a quarterly basis.\nManagement has determined the allowance\nfor doubtful accounts by regularly evaluating individual customer receivables and considering a customer\u2019s financial condition\nand credit history, and current economic conditions. As of each of December 31, 2016 and 2015, we maintained an allowance for doubtful\naccounts related to our accounts receivable in the amount of $100,000.\nInventory\n- Inventory\nis stated at lower of cost or market, with cost being determined on an average cost basis. During the year\nended December 31, 2016, the Company recorded an impairment of inventory expense of $3,562,459 (See Note 4 of the Company\u2019s consolidated financial statements).\nRevenue Recognition\n\u2013 The Company recognizes revenue in accordance with the ASC Topic 605,\nRevenue Recognition\n(\u201cASC\n605\u201d) which requires persuasive evidence of an arrangement, delivery of a product or service, a fixed or determinable\nprice and assurance of collection within a reasonable period of time. The Company records revenue when goods are delivered to\nthe carrier and the rights of ownership have transferred from the Company to the customer.\nIn the normal course of business, the Company\nmay offer discounts or promotions for various products to incentivize sales growth and brand awareness. Such discounts or promotions\nare recorded as a reduction to sales revenue.\nLong-Lived Assets\n- In accordance\nwith ASC Topic 360,\nAccounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets\n, the Company reviews property and equipment\nfor impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable.\nRecoverability of property and equipment is measured by comparing its carrying value to the undiscounted projected future cash\nflows that the asset(s) are expected to generate. If the carrying amount of an asset is not recoverable, we recognize an impairment\nloss based on the excess of the carrying amount of the long-lived asset over its respective fair value, which is generally determined\nas the present value of estimated future cash flows or at the appraised value. The impairment analysis is based on significant\nassumptions of future results made by management, including revenue and cash flow projections. Circumstances that may lead to impairment\nof property and equipment include a significant decrease in the market price of a long-lived asset, a significant adverse change\nin the extent or manner in which a long-lived asset is being used or in its physical condition and a significant adverse change\nin legal factors or in the business climate that could affect the value of a long-lived asset including an adverse action or assessment\nby a regulator.\nStock-Based Compensation\n- Certain employees, officers, directors and consultants of the Company participate in various long-term incentive plans that provide\nfor the granting of stock options, restricted stock awards, restricted stock units, stock bonus awards and performance-based awards.\nStock options generally vest in equal increments over a two- to four-year period and expire on the tenth anniversary following\nthe date of grant. Performance-based stock options vest once the applicable performance condition is satisfied. Restricted stock\nawards generally vest 100% at the grant date.\nThe Company recognizes stock-based compensation\nfor equity awards granted to employees, officers, and directors as compensation and benefits expense on the Consolidated Statements\nof Operations. The fair value of stock options is estimated using a Black-Scholes valuation model on the date of grant. The fair\nvalue of restricted stock awards is equal to the closing price of the Company\u2019s stock on the date of grant. Stock-based compensation\nis recognized over the requisite service period of the individual awards, which generally equals the vesting period. For performance-based\nstock options, compensation is recognized once the applicable performance condition is satisfied.\n10\nThe Company recognizes stock-based compensation\nfor equity awards granted to consultants as selling, general and administrative expense on the consolidated statements of operations.\nThe fair value of stock options is estimated\nusing a Black-Scholes valuation model on the date of grant and unvested shares are revalued at each reporting period. The fair\nvalue of restricted stock awards is equal to the closing price of the Company\u2019s stock on the date of grant multiplied by\nthe number of shares awarded. Stock-based compensation is recognized over the requisite service period of the individual awards,\nwhich generally equals the vesting period.\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\nRefer to Note 2 of our consolidated financial\nstatements for a discussion of recent accounting standards and pronouncements.\nResults of Operations\nYear ended December 31, 2016 vs. December\n31, 2015\nRevenues\nWe had sales of $11,060,636 and gross profit\nof $6,997,635, representing a gross profit percentage of 63.3% for the year ended December 31, 2016 compared with sales of $11,529,402\nand gross profit of $6,730,984, representing a gross profit percentage of 58.4% for the year ended December 31, 2015. When excluding\nthe Company\u2019s one-time $2,000,000 sale of products to MJNA during the year ended December 31, 2015, the Company increased\nsales by $1,531,234 or 16.1% during the year ended December 31, 2016 when compared with the same period in 2015, on an as-adjusted\nbasis. As further discussed in Note 3 in the accompanying notes to our consolidated financial statements, in August 2015, we entered\ninto an agreement to sell MJNA our products and received from MJNA a promissory note in the principal amount of $2,002,910 (the\n\u201cMJNA Promissory Note\u201d) that was to be paid in 12 equal installments beginning on November 3, 2015 in exchange for\nthe product shipped to MJNA. MJNA failed to provide any payments to us on the MJNA Promissory Note and was in default. Thereafter,\nin November 2016, we entered into a Mutual Release and Satisfaction of the Note with MJNA (the \u201cNote Release\u201d). Pursuant\nto the terms of the Note Release, MJNA paid us $859,486 in full satisfaction of all obligations outstanding with regards to the\nMJNA Promissory Note (See Note 3 of the Company\u2019s consolidated financial statements).\nThe sales increase, on an as-adjusted basis,\nfor the year ended December 31, 2016 compared with 2015 is primarily due to an increase in customer awareness and demand for our\nPlusCBDTM\nproducts, particularly during the latter part of the year, as we continue to expand and maintain our core\ncustomer base which further supports our decision to change our sales strategy from primarily bulk oil sales during 2015 to primarily\nfinished goods consumer products in 2016.\nThe gross profit increase in 2016 compared\nwith 2015 is the result of our change in sales mix and larger harvest and processing yields, which resulted in lower production\ncosts for bulk oil and finished products.\nSelling, general and administrative\nexpenses\n- For the year ended December 31, 2016, we incurred selling, general and administrative (the \u201cSG&A\u201d)\nexpenses in the amount of $13,129,950 compared with $17,377,282 for the year ended December 31, 2015. SG&A expense includes\nnon-cash expenses of $3,274,034 and $5,969,316 of stock-based compensation, $195,167 and $190,335 of depreciation expense, $857,400\nand $822,000 of amortization expense of intangible assets, and $59,143 and $2,654,836 of bad debt expense for the years ended December\n31, 2016 and 2015, respectively. After adjusting for non-cash stock-based compensation, depreciation, amortization of intangible\nassets and bad debt expense for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, SG&A expenses increased by $1,003,411 during the\nyear ended December 31, 2016 compared with the year ended December 31, 2015. Part of this increase resulted from $388,739 of expense\nrelated to our specialty pharmaceutical segment, which began operations in the second quarter of 2016, and increased headcount,\ncommissions and employee benefits expenses related thereto.\nResearch and development expenses\n- For the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, we incurred research and development expenses of $1,159,009 and $1,320,003,\nrespectively. These expenses are related to our cost of process development, rental of our laboratory facility, payroll expenses,\nlaboratory supplies, product development and testing, outsourced research personnel, and R&D expenses related to our specialty\npharmaceutical segment. During the year ended December 31, 2016, we incurred $324,046 of R&D expenses related to our specialty\npharmaceutical segment and also incurred $0 and $78,877 of stock-based compensation during the years ended December 31, 2016 and\n2015, respectively. After adjusting for the specialty pharmaceutical R&D expense and the non-cash stock-based compensation,\nR&D costs related to our consumer products segment decreased by $406,163. This decrease resulted primarily from decreased headcount\nand fewer scientific studies.\n11\nInterest income\/expense\nInterest\nincome was $27,658 and $18,287, respectively, for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015. The increase in interest income is\ndue to an increase in interest earned on a note receivable during the year ended December 31, 2016 when compared with interest\nearned on a note receivable during the year ended December 31, 2015. Interest expense was $1,086,793 for the year ended December\n31, 2016 compared with interest expense of $968,615 for the year ended December 31, 2015. The increase in interest expense for\nthe year ended December 31, 2016 compared with the same period in 2015 was due to increased borrowings, accrued interest and the\namortizations of debt discounts. Interest expense for the year ended December 31, 2015 relates\nprimarily to interest on our notes payable.\nGain on collection of related party\nnotes receivable\nGain on collection of related party notes receivable of $379,486 during the year ended December 31, 2016\nrelates to our previously existing MJNA settlement note receivable of $480,000, from which we received $859,486 in settlement proceeds,\nas discussed above (See Note 3 of the Company\u2019s consolidated financial statements).\nGain on change in derivative liability\nGain on change in derivative liability of $147,200 during the year ended December 31, 2016 relates to the change in the\nderivative liability from inception to December 31, 2016 on the Iliad Note (See Note 8 of the Company\u2019s consolidated financial statements).\nImpairment of Inventory\nImpairment of inventory of $3,562,459 during the year ended December 31, 2016, relates to the write-off of certain raw material\ninventory (See Note 4 of the Company\u2019s consolidated financial statements).\nImpairment of PhytoSPHERE\ngoodwill and intangible assets\nImpairment of PhytoSPHERE goodwill and intangible assets of $2,746,512 during the year\nended December 31, 2016 relates to the write-off of goodwill and intangible assets associated with the PhytoSPHERE\nacquisition (See Note 7 of the Company\u2019s consolidated financial statements).\nLitigation settlement income\nLitigation settlement income of $756,714 for the year ended December 31, 2015 relates to our settlement agreement with MJNA, HempMeds\nPX, LLC, Kannaway, LLC, General Hemp, LLC, HDDC Holdings, LLC, Rabbit Hole Technologies, Inc., Hemp Deposit and Distribution Corporation\nand MJNA Holdings, LLC (collectively, the \u201cMJNA Parties\u201d) to settle multiple litigation matters between the Company\nand the MJNA Parties (the \u201cSettlement Agreement\u201d). Pursuant to the Settlement Agreement, the MJNA Parties paid us the\nsum of $150,000 and delivered a promissory note in the principal amount of $600,000, bearing interest at 6% per annum, as further\ndescribed in our Current Report on Form 8-K filed with the SEC on July 20, 2015.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nA summary of our changes in cash flows\nfor the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015 is provided below.\nFor the years ended December 31,\n2016\n2015\nNet cash flows provided by (used in).\nOperating activities\n$(2,053,740\n)\n$(4,208,267\n)\nInvesting activities\n852,678\n(1,742,760\n)\nFinancing activities\n1,740,068\n4,167,071\nNet increase (decrease) in cash and restricted cash\n539,006\n(1,783,956\n)\nCash and restricted cash, beginning of period\n518,462\n2,302,418\nCash and restricted cash, end of period\n$1,057,468\n$518,462\nCash requirements and liquidity needs are\nprimarily funded through our cash flow from operations and our ability to obtain proceeds from selling Company stock and assuming\ndebt.\nOperating Activities\nNet cash provided by or used\nin operating activities includes net loss adjusted for non-cash expenses such as depreciation and amortization, bad\ndebt expense, amortizations of debt issuance costs, gains or losses on the derivative liability, stock-based compensation and accrued interest expense.

Amortization of debt issuance cost, derivative liability discount and beneficial conversion feature\nof convertible debt totaled $697,406 for the year ended December 31, 2016, and $838,807 for the year ended December 31, 2015.\nStock-based compensation totaled an aggregate of $3,274,034 for the year ended December 31, 2016 and $6,048,193 for the year\nended December 31, 2015. During the year ended December 31, 2016, the Company recognized $59,143 of bad debt expense related\nto the write-off of certain accounts receivable compared with $2,654,836 of bad debt expense related to the write-down of\ncertain notes receivable during the year ended December 21, 2015. Accrued interest payable was $128,311, the gain on\ncollection of related party notes receivable was $379,486, the gain on change in derivative liability was $147,200, the\nimpairment of inventory was $3,562,459, the impairment of PhytoSPHERE goodwill and intangible assets was $2,746,512 and the\nloss on the sale of fixed assets was $8,544 during the year ended December 31, 2016.\nInvesting Activities\nNet cash provided by investing activities\nfor the year ended December 31, 2016 totaled $852,678 compared with net cash used in investing activities of $1,742,760 for the\nyear December 31, 2015. Net cash provided by investing activity for the year ended December 31, 2016 consisted of $859,486 in cash\nreceived in connection with the collection of the related parties notes receivable and cash received from the sale of fixed assets\nof $10,399, offset by $17,207 of property and equipment purchases. Net cash used in investing activity for the year ended December\n31, 2015 consisted of $250,000 cash paid in connection with the CanX Acquisition, $113,527 of property and equipment purchases,\n$623,677 of principal repayments on notes receivable and issuance of $2,002,910 in notes receivable in connection with the sale\nof inventory to a customer.\nFinancing Activities\nNet cash provided by financing activities\nfor the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015 totaled $1,740,068 and $4,167,071, respectively. Cash flows provided by financing\nactivities in 2016 consisted of an aggregate of $2,776,430 in borrowing net proceeds from the issuance of notes payable, $250,000\npayment of contingent consideration, $612,000 of repayments on convertible notes payable and $174,362 of repayments on notes payable\nto a vendor. Cash flows provided by financing activities in 2015 primarily include $2,520,000 in proceeds from the sale of common\nstock and $1,508,096 in borrowing net proceeds from the issuance of convertible debt.\nThe Company has yet to attain a level of\noperations which allows it to meet operating and working capital cash flow needs. We expect to realize revenue to fund a portion\nof our working capital needs through the sale of finished products and raw materials to third parties. However, in order to fund\nour pharmaceutical product development efforts, we will need to raise additional capital through either the issuance of equity\nand\/or the issuance of debt. We expect to be dependent upon obtaining additional financing in order to adequately fund working\ncapital, infrastructure and expenses in order to execute plans for future operations so that we can achieve a level of revenue\nadequate to support our cost structure, none of which can be assured.\nLiquidity\nFor the years ended December 31, 2016\nand 2015, The Company had net losses of $14,141,298 and $12,233,128, respectively. In addition, for the years ended December\n31, 2016 and 2015, the Company had negative cash flows from operations of $2,053,740 and $4,208,267, respectively. Management\nbelieves the Company has the funds needed to continue its consumer product business segment and meet its other obligations\nover the next year solely from current revenues and cash flow due to increased sales and because our current inventory levels\nare sufficient to support sales for 2017, resulting in reduced cash outflow for inventory purchases. In addition, we do not\nintend to purchase raw inventory from our supply chain arrangements from the 2017 crop and\/or 2018 crop. The Company\u2019s\npharmaceutical business segment will require additional financing over the next 12 months through March 31, 2018. Management\nbelieves that it will be able to obtain sufficient financing on terms acceptable to the Company, however, there can be no\nassurances that the Company will be successful. If the Company is unable to raise additional capital, the Company would\nlikely be forced to curtail pharmaceutical development.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nThe Company has two\nsupply arrangements in place with European farmers to supply raw material in future years. The first arrangement contemplates\ngrowth and processing of 2,600 kilograms of product and the second contract provides up to 1 million kilograms of raw product\nto the Company. We have contractual rights for the growth and processing of hemp oil for delivery through October 2018 under\nboth contracts.  We do not intend to purchase raw inventory from our supply chain arrangements from the 2017 crop and\/or 2018 crop.\n13","28":"","29":"","30":"","31":"ITEM 7: MANAGEMENT\u2019S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nReference is made to \u201cItem 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.\u201d The information contained therein is essential to, and should be read in conjunction with, the following analysis.\n(a)\nLiquidity\nThe Partnership\u2019s assets are generally held as cash or cash equivalents, which are used to margin the Partnership\u2019s futures positions and are sold to pay redemptions and expenses as needed. Other than any potential market-imposed limitations on liquidity, the Partnership\u2019s assets are highly liquid and are expected to remain so. Market-imposed limitations, when they occur, can be due to limited open interest in certain futures markets or to daily price fluctuation limits, which are inherent in the Partnership\u2019s futures trading. A portion of the Partnership\u2019s assets not used for margin and held with the Custodian are invested in liquid, high quality securities. Through December 31, 2016 the Partnership experienced no meaningful periods of illiquidity in any of the markets traded by the Advisor on behalf of the Partnership.\n(b)\nCapital Resources\nThe Partnership raises additional capital only through the sale of Interests and capital is increased through trading profits (if any) and interest income. The Partnership does not engage in borrowing.\n12\nThe amount of capital raised for the Partnership should not have a significant impact on its operations, as the Partnership has no significant capital expenditure or working capital requirements other than for capital to pay trading losses, brokerage commissions and expenses. Within broad ranges of capitalization, the Partnership\u2019s trading positions should increase or decrease in approximate proportion to the size of the Partnership.\nThe Partnership participates in the speculative trading of commodity futures contracts, options on futures contracts and forward contracts, substantially all of which are subject to margin requirements. The minimum amount of margin required for each contract is set from time to time in response to various market factors by the respective exchanges. Further, the Partnership\u2019s FCMs and brokers may require margin in excess of minimum exchange requirements.\nContracts currently traded by the Advisor on behalf of the Partnership include exchange-traded futures contracts and over-the-counter forward currency contracts. The risks associated with exchange-traded contracts are generally perceived to be less than those associated with over-the-counter transactions because, in over-the-counter transactions, the Partnership must rely solely on the credit of its trading counterparties, whereas exchange-traded contracts are generally, but not universally, backed by the collective credit of the members of the exchange. The credit risk from counterparty non-performance associated with the Partnership\u2019s over-the-counter forward currency transactions is the net unrealized gain on such contracts plus related collateral held by the counterparty.\nThe Partnership bears the risk of financial failure by SGAS and\/or other clearing brokers or counterparties with which the Partnership trades.\n(c)\nResults of Operations\nThe Partnership\u2019s success depends primarily upon the Advisor\u2019s ability to recognize and capitalize on market trends in the sectors of the global commodity futures markets in which it trades. The Partnership seeks to produce long-term capital appreciation through growth, and not current income. The past performance of the Partnership is not necessarily indicative of future results.\nPerformance Summary\n2016\nDuring 2016, the Partnership achieved net realized and unrealized gains of $484,095 from all trading; gains of $359,869 from trading of derivatives including brokerage commissions of $4,590,391. The Partnership accrued total expenses of $11,806,214, including $180,109 in incentive fees, $3,279,777 in management fees paid to the General Partner, and $4,410,030 in service and professional fees. The Partnership earned $736,778 in interest income during 2016. An analysis of the profits and losses generated from the Partnership\u2019s commodity futures trading activities for each quarter during 2016 is set forth below.\nFourth Quarter 2016.\nThe Partnership was down in October 2016. Yields on many government bonds hit multi-month highs during October alongside higher inflation expectations and doubts around the willingness of central banks to ease policy further. Gold suffered its heaviest one-day fall since December 2013 and the US dollar strengthened versus most major currencies ahead of the publication of minutes from the Federal Open Market Committee\u2019s September meeting. Ongoing uncertainty about US elections combined with some earnings misses from notable companies weighed on the S&P 500. In the UK, gilts and sterling fared particularly poorly as comments made at the ruling party\u2019s conference earlier in the month suggested that the government is open to a \u2018hard Brexit\u2019 when negotiations begin in 2017. Elsewhere, crude oil gave back earlier gains to end the month slightly lower than where it started amid doubts around OPEC\u2019s planned cuts to production as well as building US inventories. The Partnership\u2019s returns fell during October with the fixed income, precious metals and stock index sectors driving the losses. Long positions across bonds and short-term interest rates dropped amid rising yields and increasing expectations of a US rate hike. The latter also boosted the US dollar which weighed on precious metals, hurting positions in gold and silver. In stock indices, returns were mixed at the market level but negative overall. The currencies sector was the most noteworthy positive contributor to returns in October as the Partnership gained from short positions in the British pound and the euro. In terms of positioning, gross exposure to fixed income, energies and precious metals was reduced over the month. The Partnership was also down in November 2016. Equities continued their October slide in the opening week as U.S. election polls showed a narrowing Presidential race. These concerns eased in the run up to the election results, before markets briefly sold off. By month end, US indices had hit new all-time highs on renewed optimism. Bonds had a more challenging time, with US Treasuries posting their worst monthly loss since 2009 amid talk of accelerating US inflation and increased federal deficits. Against this backdrop, the US dollar appreciated versus the Japanese yen and the euro, as gold fell. After some intra-month volatility, crude oil rallied on the final day of the month as OPEC agreed on a deal to cut production. For the month as a whole, the Partnership posted a loss as profits in stock indices and crops were offset by the energies and fixed income sectors. Overall long stock index positions, most notably in the US and Japan, added value and gains in crops were driven by short positions. Crude oil and natural gas led the losses in energies, while rising yields led to significant reductions in the Partnership\u2019s long fixed income positions. Elsewhere in currencies, profits from a short position in the euro were undone by positioning in emerging market currencies and the British pound.\n13\nThe Partnership was up in December 2016. The S&P 500 hit new all-time highs on hopes that the US President-elect will loosen US fiscal policy, and crude oil at prices not seen since the summer of 2015 following OPEC\u2019s deal to cut production at the end of November. The US Dollar Index, meanwhile, reached its highest level in 14 years after the US Federal Reserve increased rates for the second time since the Global Financial Crisis and signaled three further hikes for 2017. Gold prices extended their November losses against this backdrop. Across the Atlantic, monetary policy continued to head in the opposite direction with the European Central Bank announcing that it will be reducing the size but extending the duration of its asset purchase program by a further nine months. This ongoing divergence in policy led German government bond yields to fall back while US Treasury yields maintained their upwards trajectory. The Partnership\u2019s profits during the month were driven by positioning in the stock index, currency and fixed income sectors. Gains in stock indices came from across long positions in developed markets as most major indices rose over the month. In currencies, the Partnership benefited from a short position in the Japanese yen and long positions in emerging markets, most notably the Brazilian real which appreciated around 5% against the US dollar. A short position in Eurodollar futures was particularly profitable in light of upward US interest rate expectations. Reducing these profits, short crude oil positions led losses in the energies sector, while a reversal in the recent copper rally weighed on performance in the base metals sector.\nThird Quarter 2016\n. The Partnership enjoyed slightly positive returns in July 2016. Government bonds continued to rise as yields on US ten-year Treasuries fell to an all-time low and the German government issued negative yielding ten-year bonds for the first time. Yields bounced back mid-month after positive US data releases and the Bank of England held off on an anticipated cut to interest rates, but the majority of developed sovereign bond markets still ended the month in positive territory. Currencies\u2019 positive performance was driven by market movements on the final day of the month, due to appreciation in the Japanese yen. In commodities, oil prices retreated while precious metals continued to appreciate. The most dramatic event over the course of the month was a failed coup in Turkey, which resulted in the lira falling to a record low against the US dollar and a selloff in the country\u2019s stock market and government bonds. The Partnership benefited in this environment from net long positions in bonds and stock indices, short positions in energies and long positions in precious metals, with equal profits from gold and silver.\n. Detractors from performance in July 2016 included long positions in crops and short-term interest rates. The Partnership\u2019s performance was negative in August 2016, amid a particularly quiet month in terms of market volatility. Equities edged higher; government bonds lost ground overall, and the US dollar appreciated versus most major currencies. Commodity markets provided more substantial price action as speculation around supply-demand imbalances led to rallies within the energies sector and sharp selloffs in a number of soft commodities. The Partnership\u2019s negative performance was driven by the fixed income, precious metals and energies sectors. Hawkish comments from the US Federal Reserve increased expectations of a further US rate rise in 2016 and led to losses from long positions in US government bonds and Eurodollar futures, while the strengthening US dollar weighed on the Partnership\u2019s long positioning in gold and silver as well as the Japanese yen. In the energy sector, the Partnership\u2019s short positions suffered as crude oil rallied during the first half of the month on hopes of a production freeze. The Partnership experienced flat to negative performance during September 2016, as volatility increased due to the prospect of changes in central bank policies, resulting in early gains in equities, precious metals and bonds, but later offset by losses in the Partnership\u2019s long bond and stock index positions. Within commodities, the Partnership posted a small negative return as losses in the energies, bonds and base metals sectors outweighed profits made in currencies and precious metals. Short positioning detracted from performance in energies, while losses from long positions in US government bonds undid profits earned in German government bonds. In base metals, the Partnership experienced losses from positioning in copper, while long positions in precious metals added value over the month. Performance in currencies was driven by long exposure to the Japanese yen.\n14\nSecond Quarter 2016\n. The Partnership\u2019s performance was negative in April 2016, as a number of long-term trends continued to reverse. US and European government bond prices drifted lower, commodities appreciated, while gains in energy and materials stocks lifted global equity markets. Oil prices hit their highest levels since last November. Performance in this environment was driven by losses from across the portfolio. Fixed income led the detractors as long positions in bonds and short-term interest rates weighed on returns. In energies, rising prices caused short positions to detract, particularly in heating oil futures. The crops sector was another area that cost performance as corn and soybean prices surged in response to exceptionally poor weather conditions in South America. Currencies offset some of the detractors as the investment system benefited from a long position in a rallying Japanese yen at month-end. Elsewhere, the portfolio also profited from gains in the gold price and positioning across the livestock sector. The Partnership also experienced a loss for the month of May 2016, as markets reacted to an anticipated US interest rate rise, The US dollar responded by appreciating versus most major currencies and gold gave up its April gains \u2013 both moves representing a reversal in year-to-date trends. Meanwhile, global stock markets rose slightly over the month, but with offsetting positions between regions, the sector remained largely flat. Oil prices rose to just under $50 a barrel as the global supply glut finally started to ease following supply disruptions in Nigeria, Libya, Venezuela, and Canada. The value of WTI crude futures contracts climbed to a seven-month high. Against this backdrop, currencies and precious metals posted losses. Long positioning in the Japanese yen and Australian dollar held back returns, while an increased exposure to gold was responsible for most of the negative performance from the precious metals sector. In fixed income, bunds led bond sector returns, but there were losses in short-term interest rates. Crops performed well, attributable largely to profits from trading in soybeans. The Partnership enjoyed a reversal of previous-months\u2019 losses, and experienced robust gains for June 2016, after a tumultuous period. As financial markets gradually absorbed the impact of the momentous decision resulting from the UK referendum to exit the European Union, this led to high levels of volatility in virtually all major markets traded by the Partnership and record levels in some. The referendum also had immediate political ramifications in the UK, contributing to the volatility. The resultant short-term volatility contributed to the Partnership\u2019s positive performance across most sectors traded by the end of June 2016.\nFirst Quarter 2016\n. In January 2016, the Partnership enjoyed modest net gains, despite a rocky start as renewed anxiety around the health of the global economy led to heavy falls in world stock markets. Central bankers responded by hinting at further accommodative policy, and the Bank of Japan surprised markets by cutting interest rates on new bank reserves on the final day of the month. Fixed income was the main driver of Partnership performance in this environment, most notably in Europe: Euribor and Bunds futures prices both recovered their December losses over the course of the month. Energies were another area of strength as the Partnership continued to follow the crude oil price lower amid rising stockpiles and the removal of sanctions on Iran. These gains, however, were trimmed by other parts of the portfolio, as there were losses in equities, while at the same time, short exposure to a rising gold price detracted from overall performance. The Partnership\u2019s portfolio also experienced net investment gains in February 2016, a period when global stock markets were steadier than in January, while gold and government bond prices resumed their upwards trajectory. One of the most notable developments was the British pound sliding to a seven-year low versus the US dollar, as heightened concerns around \u201cBrexit\u201d took hold (i.e., the possibility of Britain exiting the European Union). The Partnership\u2019s performance was similar to that of January 2016 in terms of sector contributions: fixed income and energies were the biggest contributors, while a reduced short exposure to gold led the precious metals positioning to detract. Within fixed income, the Partnership benefited from gains in bond futures. The Partnership also made modest gains in energies and equities during the period. The Partnership sustained a net loss in March 2016, a month characterized by a lack of meaningful diversifiers materializing within the portfolio and reversals in a number of market trends, many of which were profitable during the opening months of the year. Dovish comments from the US Federal Reserve and easing concerns around China were accompanied by a weakening US dollar and increases in commodity prices. Buoyant global stock markets recovered most of their January and February losses, whereas gold\u2019s advances abated. Against this backdrop, the bulk of the Partnership\u2019s losses occurred in its positioning of currencies (notwithstanding some emerging market currency positive returns) and fixed income (as yields rose for the first half of the month only to fall back to where they started by month end). The Partnership in March gave up its earlier profits in the year due to losses on its short positions in energies, as the WTI crude price recovered from around $34 a barrel to $38. Overall short exposure to stock index and crops futures resulted in the Partnership\u2019s failure to profit from buoyant equity markets and agricultural prices during the month.\n15\n2015\nDuring 2015, the Partnership achieved net realized and unrealized gains of $6,531,302 from all trading; gains of $6,364,428 from trading of derivatives including brokerage commissions of $5,427,184. The Partnership accrued total expenses of $18,042,969, including $4,373,262 in incentive fees, $3,921,148 in management fees paid to the General Partner, and $4,994,988 in service and professional fees. The Partnership earned $415,355 in interest income during 2015. An analysis of the profits and losses generated from the Partnership\u2019s commodity futures trading activities for each quarter during 2015 is set forth below.\nFourth Quarter 2015.\nThe Partnership experienced a loss in October 2015. Stock markets rallied at the beginning of the month, causing the Partnership to lose money as a result of its short exposure to stock index futures contracts. The Partnership\u2019s short positions in energy and gold lost money early in the month when oil prices and gold prices rose. During the second half of the month oil prices declined, and the Partnership benefitted from short energy futures contracts. The Partnership also benefitted from short positions in natural gas. Comments from Mario Draghi in Europe led to a large drop in the Euro against the U.S. Dollar and European short-term interest rate futures declined. Both moves benefitted the Partnership as two of the top contributors for the month, although the final few days saw fixed income overall slip to a loss on the month. The Partnership achieved a gain in November 2015. There were two broad and related themes within the Partnership during November: the heightened expectation of a December rate hike in the U.S. and the continued falls in commodity prices. The prospect of a rise in U.S. interest rates caused a fall in the Euro-U.S. Dollar exchange rate as market participants reacted to diverging monetary policy in the two regions. This resulted in the Partnership achieving gains in its currency contracts. The second theme of falling commodity prices benefited the Partnership. The Partnership\u2019s short positions in gold, base metals, crops, energies and livestock all benefitted performance. The Partnership experienced a loss in December 2015 primarily driven by positions in currency and fixed income. The rise in U.S. interest rates did not create a surprise in the market. The European Central Bank\u2019s announcement to commit to further easing did cause some surprise, though, as the easing was less aggressive than market participants expected. As a result, the Euro had its second-largest daily moves ever, and European short-term interest rates spiked. These moves adversely impacted the Partnership\u2019s performance. In contrast the Partnership benefitted from short positions in crude oil futures and to a smaller extent positions in livestock and crops.\nThird Quarter 2015\n. The Partnership experienced a gain in July 2015. Large scale intervention by Beijing\u2019s authorities sparked further concerns in Chinese markets as unprecedented selling restrictions were imposed on stocks. At the Federal Market Open Committee meeting, the U.S. Federal Reserve referenced an upbeat labor market, though remained cautious on their inflation outlook. The Partnership benefited from strong performance in futures on light sweet crude oil, Brent crude oil and heating oil. The Partnership\u2019s short positions in gold futures benefitted from the metal\u2019s slide through $1100 and contributed to performance. Long positions in futures on short term interest rates also benefitted performance. The Partnership experienced a loss from long futures positions on Asian indices, particularly the Hang Seng and HSCEI. The Partnership experienced a loss in August 2015. The devaluation of the Chinese yuan at the start of the month soon seemed like a distant memory, as it was overshadowed by equity market moves. The spillover of these concerns sparked a global equity market correction. However, like other such \u201ccorrections\u201d in recent history, a quick rebound saw much of the losses reversed. The Partnership\u2019s positions in futures on indices and currencies detracted from performance, especially its positions in the E-Mini S&P, Dow Jones Eurostoxx 50 and the Euro. The Partnership\u2019s positions in gold also detracted from performance. The Partnership experienced a gain in September 2015. It turned out that all the talk of the U.S. Federal Reserve raising rates in September was for nothing, as global growth concerns seemed to leave the decision makers wanting to hold off on acting for a little longer. As has often been the case in recent history, the retracement of stock markets was accompanied by a rise in fixed income. This meant that the Partnership\u2019s long exposure to futures on government bonds and short-term interest rates was the main driver of performance for the month. The Partnership\u2019s performance also benefitted from its short positions in Brent crude oil, light sweet crude oil, and heating oil. Short futures positions in corn and wheat detracted from performance.\n16\nSecond Quarter 2015\n. The Partnership experienced a loss in April 2015. Weaker economic data saw sentiment around the U.S. economy drop, with the statement from the Federal Reserve\u2019s April meeting not giving any real clues as to when rates might rise. This diverted attention away from Greece where there had been fears that the incumbent government\u2019s actions might move it closer to an EU exit. Chinese stocks saw strong moves at the start of the month as the People\u2019s Bank of China kept up its monetary easing policies, while possible reforms to state-owned enterprises began to surface. The big moves at the end of the month created losses for the Partnership. The majority of these were in currencies and energies, owing to long U.S. dollar exposure and short energy futures positions. The German Bunds reversed two months\u2019 worth of gains in just two days, adding to the Partnership\u2019s losses. Additional losses came from stock index futures positions. The Partnership\u2019s performance benefited from its short positions in gold futures. The Partnership experienced a slight gain in May 2015. A breadth of economic and political considerations laid the foundation for a turbulent month across global financial markets. These included responsive monetary policy action from central banks, stalling negotiations and heightened doubts regarding Greece\u2019s ability to meet IMF repayments, and volatility in the Euro. The Partnership\u2019s long exposure in fixed income futures detracted from performance. The Partnership\u2019s short exposure to coffee and sugar futures contributed positively to performance. The Partnership\u2019s performance benefited from its long exposure to the Nikkei 225 and the S&P and its long and short positions in the Euro and Japanese Yen. The Partnership experienced a loss in June 2015. During the month, Greek apprehension deepened as the government moved closer to a sovereign debt default, imposing capital controls in fear of a likely \u201cbank run\u201d. The Euro ended the month higher, resulting in a loss in the Partnership\u2019s short positions in Euro futures. The Partnership\u2019s long positions in British pound futures contributed to performance due to a strong rally in the British pound. The Partnership also benefitted from its short positions in gold and energies futures. May U.S. non-farm payrolls increased by 280,000 and, accompanied by a host of positive economic data, led U.S. government bond yields higher. The Partnership\u2019s positions in fixed income futures experienced losses, though small gains were made in long term U.S. bond contracts. Heavy rains in the U.S. Midwest hampered crop prospects and adversely impacted the Partnership\u2019s short positions in grains.\nFirst Quarter 2015\n. The Partnership experienced a gain in January 2015. The most dramatic market moving event in January was probably the decision by the Swiss Central Bank to remove the cap on the strength of the Swiss Franc against the Euro. Other market moving events during the month were the European Central Bank affirming their commitment to Quantitative Easing and the election of an anti-austerity government in Greece. The net effect on the Partnership\u2019s futures positions in currencies was a loss in the CHF-USD dollar position being offset by a gain in the EUR-USD dollar position. The Partnership achieved gains in its trading of futures contracts in European bonds and US government bonds. The Partnership also benefited from its short position in futures contracts in the energy sector. The Partnership experienced a slight gain in February 2015. The Partnership\u2019s long futures position in stock indices contributed to the Partnership\u2019s gains. The Partnership experienced losses on its short positions in Brent Crude and RBOB gasoline. Losses were also incurred from long futures positions in U.S. 10-year and 5-year Treasury Notes. The Partnership\u2019s performance was adversely impacted by its short positions in British Pound. The Partnership experienced a gain in March 2015. The European Central Bank initiated their quantitative easing program in March. Economic commentators speculated over the Federal Reserve Chairwoman\u2019s, Janet Yellen, removal of the word \u201cpatient\u201d. The change in her language upheld the possibility of U.S. rate rises later in the year, however, the market\u2019s perception was dovish following the Federal Reserve\u2019s downward revision of growth and inflation expectations. Both central banking events contributed to global equity markets oscillating their way through the month. The Partnership achieved gains in its trading in futures contracts in Bunds and Eurodollars. The short futures position on the Euro against the dollar made significant positive contribution to performance. Short positions in Brent Crude Oil and RBOB Gasoline also contributed positively to performance. The Partnership\u2019s short position in futures on copper experienced losses after copper rallied strongly against news of the world\u2019s second largest copper mine halting production over labor disputes.\n17\n2014\nDuring 2014, the Partnership achieved net realized and unrealized gains of $63,459,297 from all trading; gains of $64,089,929 from trading of derivatives including brokerage commissions of $6,413,798. The Partnership incurred total expenses of $28,597,912, including $12,826,879 in incentive fees, $4,603,469 in management fees paid to the General Partner, and $5,657,573 in service and professional fees. The Partnership earned $375,189 in interest income during 2014. An analysis of the profits and losses generated from the Partnership\u2019s commodity futures trading activities for each quarter during 2014 is set forth below.\nFourth Quarter 2014.\nThe Partnership experienced a gain in October 2014. The $10 a barrel fall in crude oil prices and a declining gold market meant that short futures positions in both Brent crude oil and gold significantly contributed to performance. Grain markets rallied during the month, and the Partnership\u2019s long futures position contributed to positive performance. Gains were also made on futures contracts of the US 10-year treasury note. The Partnership experienced losses on its long positions in futures in the Dow Jones Eurostoxx 50 and Dax equity stock indices. The Partnership experienced a gain in November 2014. The announcement of a broadly unexpected and unprecedented large monetary stimulus package from the Bank of Japan set the tone of a strong month for global equities and significant Japanese Yen depreciation, profiting the Partnership\u2019s futures contracts\u2019 positions on Japanese Yen and the E-mini S&P. The Partnership\u2019s short position in Brent crude oil also contributed to performance. The Partnership\u2019s long positions in futures on bonds contributed to gains in the portfolio during the month. The Partnership experienced losses during the month on its long futures position on the British Pound. Futures positions in gold and natural gas also detracted from performance. The Partnership achieved gains in December 2014. The decline in the price of oil continued in December resulting in the Partnership\u2019s short futures position in Brent crude oil and light sweet crude oil contributing positively to performance. Sentiment weighed on Europe leading to relatively poor performance for European equity indices, a lower Euro and higher bund prices. As a result the Partnership\u2019s long futures position in German Bunds and its short futures position in the Euro contributed positively to performance. The Partnership\u2019s positions in futures contracts on gold, natural gas and the Dow Jones Eurostoxx 50 index detracted from performance.\nThird Quarter 2014\n. The Partnership experienced a loss in July 2014. Long positions in fixed income, natural gas and crude oil futures contributed to portfolio losses. Equity markets and fixed income markets fell sharply at the end of the month following a very strong GDP number in the U.S. resulting in losses in the Partnership\u2019s position in Dow Jones Eurostoxx 50 futures. Mild summer weather in the U.S. which is forecast to continue, has limited energy consumption and subsequently seen storage rise at the fastest rate in over 10 years, eroding the value of the Partnership\u2019s natural gas contracts. Crude oil prices and the Partnership\u2019s long position in crude oil futures also fell due to low level of demand. Positions in the British pound and Eurodollar also contributed to losses. Long positions in aluminum and zinc futures contracts contributed positively to performance. Long positions in the U.S. Treasuries caused by a U.S. Treasury rally early in the month contributed to the Partnership\u2019s gain in August 2014. The Partnership\u2019s long position in the S&P index futures and short position in Euro futures also contributed positively to performance. The Partnership incurred losses on its long positions in the British pound and its positions in futures on live cattle and soybeans. The Partnership experienced a slight loss in September 2014. The prospect of higher U.S. interest rates weighed on equity and bond prices, contributing to losses in these sectors but provided continued support for the U.S. dollar and strong performance for the Partnership\u2019s long position against the Euro. The Partnership\u2019s positions in gold and silver futures, Japanese Yen and Brent crude oil contributed positively to performance. The Partnership\u2019s long position in soybean futures detracted from performance as U.S. farmers began harvesting a record crop and China suspended import approval for two genetically modified traits.\nSecond Quarter 2014\n. The Partnership experienced a gain in April 2014. Uncertainty relating to tensions in Ukraine and additional sanctions imposed on Russia by the US and Europe continued to weigh on investor conviction through April. These events contributed to mixed performance in the global stock market. The Partnership\u2019s holding in futures on the Nikkei index detracted from performance. The European Central Bank\u2019s (\u201cECB\u201d) announcement to open the door to potential large-scale asset purchases benefitted the Partnership\u2019s long fixed income positions where German Bunds provided the most significant contribution to the Partnership. Natural gas prices rose during the month along with the value of the Partnership\u2019s long position in natural gas. The crop sector also posted positive performance, in particular the Partnership\u2019s futures position in soybeans. The Partnership experienced a gain in May 2014. Monetary policy played a key role during the month with both the President of the ECB and the Chair of the US Federal Reserve making statements. Speculation of a cut to interest rates by the ECB at the June policy meeting put the Euro under pressure and negatively impacted the long Euro position in the Partnership\u2019s currency portfolio. The Partnership\u2019s long exposure to German Bunds contributed positively to performance. Improving weather conditions in the US and Russia led to declines in the price of wheat and corn, which adversely affected the Partnership\u2019s performance. The Partnership experienced a loss in June 2014. Monetary policy by the US Federal Reserve, the ECB and the Governor of the Bank of England played an important role in the global markets during the month. These monetary policy actions provided a catalyst for a number of US indices to reach record highs, elevated the European fixed income markets and continued momentum for sterling, profiting the Partnership\u2019s long futures positions in the S&P index, German Bund and British pound sterling. Regional instability in the Middle East contributed to rising precious metal values and subsequent losses in the Partnership\u2019s short positions in the sector. The geopolitical conflicts in the region threatened refinery output benefitted the Partnership\u2019s futures positions in crude oil. The Partnership\u2019s futures contracts on corn lost value due in part to the high corn inventory levels and confirmation of record harvests in the US.\n18\nFirst Quarter 2014\n. The Partnership experienced a loss in January 2014. The markets focused on events in China, specifically the \u201cshadow banking industry\u201d and the possibility of the first ever Chinese trust bankruptcy. A last minute bailout plan allowed investors to get their principal back, but speculation remained about the potential for a Chinese credit crisis. Escalating political tension most notably in Ukraine, Turkey and Thailand increased pressure on emerging markets, and towards the end of the month the Partnership\u2019s trading in futures contracts in Ruble, Rand and global equity indices contributed to losses. The Partnership achieved gains in its trading of futures contracts in the Canadian dollar. The Partnership achieved a gain in February 2014. Global equity markets rallied through February, reversing losses experienced in January with major indices revisiting record highs and adding value to the Partnership\u2019s positions in futures in global equity indices. Mother nature had a significant influence on market performance during the month. The Partnership\u2019s short position in coffee futures experienced losses. Overly precipitous weather in the soybean producing regions of Brazil reduced the quality of maturing crops and benefitted the Partnership\u2019s long futures position as prices rose. Livestock values also moved higher which benefitted the Partnership\u2019s futures position in this sector, particularly hogs. The Partnership experienced a loss in March 2014. At the forefront of investors\u2019 minds through March were the events in the Crimean Peninsula. Russia reclaimed Crimea following a referendum which the Ukrainian parliament claimed was unconstitutional and that the United States and the European Union considered to be illegal. The resultant threat of international sanctions against Russia and the simmering geopolitical tension led to a volatile month for global markets. China\u2019s first onshore corporate bond default added to negative sentiment with data that pointed to a third consecutive monthly decline in manufacturing growth. Markets were further destabilized when the U.S. FOMC revised their projected Fed Funds targets, signaling increased conviction for more rapid monetary policy tightening once initiated. These events contributed to the Partnership\u2019s losses across index futures, U.S. fixed income and short U.S. dollar positions. The Partnership achieved gains in its short position in silver futures and in futures in the livestock sector.\n(d)\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nThe Partnership does not engage in off-balance sheet arrangements with other entities.\n(e)\nContractual Obligations\nThe Partnership does not enter into any contractual obligations or commercial commitments to make future payments of a type that would be typical for an operating company or that would affect its liquidity or capital resources. The Partnership\u2019s sole business is trading futures, related option and forward currency contracts, both long (contracts to buy) and short (contracts to sell). All such contracts are settled by offset, not delivery. Substantially all such contracts are for settlement within four months of the trade date and substantially all such contracts are held by the Partnership for less than four months before being offset or rolled over into new contracts with similar maturities. The Partnership\u2019s financial statements, included in this report, present a Condensed Schedule of Investments setting forth net unrealized appreciation (depreciation) of the Partnership\u2019s open future and forward currency contracts, both long and short, at December 31, 2016.\n19\n(f)\nCritical Accounting Estimates\nThe General Partner believes that the Partnership\u2019s most critical accounting estimates relate to the valuation of the Partnership\u2019s assets. Futures and options on futures contracts are valued using the primary exchange\u2019s closing price. Foreign currency exchange contracts and foreign cross currency exchange contracts are valued at the mean between the bid and ask prices, which approximates fair value. Interpolated values are derived when the settlement date of the contract is an interim date for which quotations are not available. U.S. government agency securities are generally valued based on quoted prices in active markets. Corporate notes are generally valued at fair value. Security transactions are recorded on the trade date. Realized gains and losses from security transactions are determined using the specific identification cost method. Assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar are translated into U.S. dollars at the rates in effect at the date of the statement of financial condition. Income and expense items denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar are translated into U.S. dollars at the rates in effect during the period. Gains and losses resulting from the translation to U.S. dollars are reported in income currently.\nThe Partnership\u2019s financial statements are presented in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (U.S. GAAP), which require the use of certain estimates made by the Partnership\u2019s management. Actual results could differ from those estimates. Based on the nature of the business and operations of the Partnership, the General Partner believes that the estimates utilized in preparing the Partnership\u2019s financial statements are appropriate and reasonable, however actual results could differ from these estimates. The estimates used do not provide a range of possible results that would require the exercise of subjective judgment. The General Partner further believes that, based on the nature of the business and operations of the Partnership, no other reasonable assumptions relating to the application of the Partnership\u2019s critical accounting estimates other than those currently used would likely result in materially different amounts from those reported.","32":"ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT\u2019S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nThe following discussion of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. This discussion contains certain forward-looking statements that involve risk and uncertainties. Our actual results may differ materially from those discussed below. Factors that could cause or contribute to such differences include, but are not limited to, those identified below and those set forth under the Section entitled \u201cRisk Factors\u201d in Item 1A, and other documents we file with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Historical results are not necessarily indicative of future results.\nSpecial Note Regarding Smaller Reporting Company Status\nWe are filing this Annual Report on Form 10-K as a \u201csmaller reporting company\u201d (as defined in Rule 12b-2 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended) based on our public float (the aggregate market value of our common equity held by non-affiliates of the Company) as of the last business day of our second fiscal quarter of 2016. As a result of being a smaller reporting company, we are allowed and have elected to omit certain information, including three years of year-to-year comparisons and tabular disclosure of contractual obligations, from this Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations; however, we have provided all information for the periods presented that we believe to be appropriate and necessary.\n63\nOverview\nWe are a clinical-stage regenerative medicine company developing novel therapeutics for cardiovascular diseases with large unmet medical needs. Our lead therapeutic candidate is the CardiAMP Cell Therapy System, or CardiAMP. We have initiated our U.S. Food and Drug Administration, or FDA, accepted Phase III pivotal trial for CardiAMP in ischemic systolic heart failure, began treating patients in February 2017 and expect to obtain top-line data in 2019. If our Phase III pivotal trial is successful, we believe we will be the first company to reach the market with a cell-based therapy to treat heart failure. Our second therapeutic candidate is the CardiALLO Cell Therapy System, or CardiALLO. We anticipate preparation of an Investigational New Drug, or IND, application for submission to the FDA for a Phase II trial for CardiALLO for the treatment of ischemic systolic heart failure. This IND is expected to have improved Chemistry Manufacturing Controls, or CMC, in the IND relative to our previous co-sponsored investigations. We are committed to applying our expertise in the fields of autologous and allogeneic cell-based therapies to improve the lives of patients with cardiovascular conditions. Autologous cell therapies use autologous cells, which mean the patient\u2019s own cells, while allogeneic cell therapies use allogeneic cells, which means cells from a third party donor.\nTo date, we have devoted substantially all of our resources to research and development efforts relating to our therapeutic candidates and biotherapeutic delivery systems, including conducting clinical trials, developing manufacturing and sales capabilities, in-licensing related intellectual property, providing general and administrative support for these operations and protecting our intellectual property. We have also generated modest revenues from sales of our approved products. We have funded our operations primarily through the sales of equity and convertible debt securities, and certain government and private grants. All convertible debt securities were converted into shares of our Common Stock in connection with the Merger.\nWe have incurred net losses in each year since our inception. Our net losses were approximately $10.3 million and $6.7 million for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively. As of December 31, 2016, we had an accumulated deficit of approximately $60.1 million. Substantially all of our net losses have resulted from costs incurred in connection with our research and development programs, clinical trials, intellectual property matters, building our manufacturing and sales capabilities, and from general and administrative costs associated with our operations.\nWe expect to continue to incur significant expenses and increasing losses for at least the next several years. Accordingly, we anticipate that we will need to raise additional capital prior to the commercialization of CardiAMP and CardiALLO. Until such time that we can generate meaningful revenue from product sales, if ever, we expect to finance our operating activities through public or private equity or debt financings, government or other third-party funding, marketing and distribution arrangements and other collaborations, strategic alliances and licensing arrangements or a combination of these approaches. In any event, we will require additional capital to obtain regulatory approval for, and to commercialize, our therapeutic candidates. If we are unable to obtain funding on a timely basis, we may be required to significantly curtail, delay or discontinue one or more of our research and development programs or the commercialization of any approved therapies or products or be unable to expand our operations or otherwise capitalize on our business opportunities, as desired, which could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nRecent Events\nOn August 22, 2016, the Company, Icicle Acquisition Corp., a Delaware corporation and our direct wholly-owned subsidiary, and BioCardia Lifesciences, Inc. (at the time, named BioCardia, Inc.) entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger, or the Merger Agreement. On October 24, 2016, pursuant to the Merger Agreement, Icicle Acquisition Corp. merged with and into BioCardia Lifesciences, with BioCardia Lifesciences continuing as the surviving company.\nBioCardia Lifesciences was determined to be the accounting acquirer, and following the completion of the Merger, we assumed the business and operations of BioCardia Lifesciences and changed our name to BioCardia, Inc.\n64\nPursuant to the Merger Agreement, each of the shares of BioCardia Lifesciences common stock issued and outstanding prior to the Merger, including shares of common stock underlying outstanding preferred stock, convertible notes (which converted into common stock immediately prior to the Merger), and stock options were converted into the right to receive 19.3678009 shares of our common stock.\nFor financial reporting purposes, the Merger is accounted for as an asset acquisition rather than a business combination because the Company did not meet the definition of a business as defined by US GAAP in advance of the Merger. The fair value of the purchase consideration, consisting of Tiger X common stock, was determined based on the fair value of the cash acquired by BioCardia Lifesciences in the Merger of $19 million, which is considered the best indicator for the fair value of the purchase consideration.  No other assets or liabilities were acquired by BioCardia Lifesciences. Transaction costs of $96,000 were recorded as a debit to additional paid in capital.\nThe Merger is considered a tax free reverse triangular merger for tax purposes pursuant to Internal Revenue Code Sections 368(a) and 368(a)(2)(E) in which the Company continues as the parent and BioCardia Lifesciences as the wholly owned subsidiary, and is therefore treated as an acquisition of stock of BioCardia Lifesciences by the Company.  Despite the stock acquisition treatment, none of our pre-Merger tax attributes remain available after the Merger as a result of limitations under Internal Revenue Code Section 382 due to lack of business continuity.\nFinancial Overview\nRevenue\nWe currently have a portfolio of enabling and delivery products, from which we have generated modest revenue.\nCost of Goods Sold\nCost of goods sold includes the costs of raw materials and components, manufacturing personnel and facility costs and other indirect and overhead costs associated with manufacturing our enabling and delivery products.\nResearch and Development Expenses\nOur research and development expenses consist primarily of.\n\u2022\nsalaries and related overhead expenses, which include share-based compensation and benefits for personnel in research and development functions;\n\u2022\nfees paid to consultants and contract research organizations, or CROs, including in connection with our preclinical studies and clinical trials and other related clinical trial fees, such as for investigator grants, patient screening, laboratory work, clinical trial material management and statistical compilation and analysis;\n\u2022\ncosts related to acquiring and manufacturing clinical trial materials;\n\u2022\ncosts related to compliance with regulatory requirements; and\n\u2022\npayments related to licensed products and technologies.\nWe expense all research and development costs in the periods in which they are incurred. Costs for certain development activities are recognized based on an evaluation of the progress to completion of specific tasks using information and data provided to us by our vendors and clinical sites. Nonrefundable advance payments for goods or services to be received in future periods for use in research and development activities are deferred and capitalized. The capitalized amounts are then expensed as the related goods are delivered and the services are performed.\nWe plan to increase our research and development expenses for the foreseeable future as we continue to develop CardiAMP, and subject to the availability of additional funding, further advance the development of CardiALLO and any other therapeutic candidates for additional indications. We typically use our employee and infrastructure resources across multiple research and development programs, and accordingly we have not historically allocated resources specifically to our individual programs.\nThe process of conducting the necessary clinical research to obtain regulatory approval is costly and time-consuming, and the successful development of our therapeutic candidates is highly uncertain. As a result, we are unable to determine the duration and completion costs of our research and development projects or when and to what extent we will generate revenue from the commercialization and sale of any of our therapeutic candidates.\n65\nSelling, General and Administrative Expenses\nSelling, general and administrative expenses consist primarily of salaries and related costs for employees in executive, finance and administration, sales, corporate development and administrative support functions, including share-based compensation expenses and benefits. Other significant selling, general and administrative expenses include sales commissions, rent, accounting and legal services, obtaining and maintaining patents, the cost of consultants, occupancy costs, insurance premiums and information systems costs.\nWe expect that our selling, general and administrative expenses will increase as we operate as a public company, conduct our Phase III pivotal trial for CardiAMP, and subject to the availability of additional funding, conduct our Phase II trial for CardiALLO and prepare for commercialization. We believe that these increases will likely include increased costs for director and officer liability insurance, costs related to the hiring of additional personnel to support product commercialization efforts and operations as a public company and increased fees for outside consultants, attorneys and accountants. We also expect to incur increased costs to comply with corporate governance, internal controls, investor relations and disclosures, and similar requirements applicable to public companies.\nOther Income (Expense)\nOther income and expense consists primarily of interest charges we incur in periods when we have convertible debt outstanding, interest income we earn on our cash and cash equivalents and changes in the fair value of our warrant and convertible shareholder note derivative liabilities. Subsequent to the Merger we have no interest charges related to the convertible debt and changes in the fair value of our warrant and convertible shareholder note derivative liabilities as such instruments were converted, cancelled or exchanged as part of the Merger. We expect our interest income to increase following the completion of the Merger as we invest our cash on hand pending its use in our operations.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nOur management\u2019s discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based on our financial statements, which we have prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States, or GAAP. The preparation of our financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of our financial statements, as well as the reported expenses during the periods presented. We evaluate these estimates and judgments on an ongoing basis. We base our estimates on historical experience and on other factors that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions.\nWe define our critical accounting policies as those that require us to make subjective estimates and judgments about matters that are uncertain and are likely to have a material impact on our financial condition and results of operations as well as the specific manner in which we apply those principles. The following discussion addresses what we believe to be the critical accounting policies used in the preparation of our financial statements that require significant estimates and judgments.\nRevenue Recognition\nWe recognize revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, delivery has occurred, the price to the buyer is fixed or determinable and collection from the customer is reasonably assured.\n\u2022\nNet Product Revenue.\nWe recognize revenues from product sales when title and risk of loss have passed to the customer, which typically occurs upon delivery. Product sale transactions are evidenced by customer purchase orders, customer contracts, invoices, and\/or the related shipping documents. Revenue is recognized net of provisions made for discounts, expected sales returns and allowances. Estimated returns and allowances are based on historical experience and other relevant factors. We accept returns for unused, unopened and resellable product in its original packaging, subject to a 20% restocking fee.\n66\n\u2022\nCollaboration Agreement Revenue.\nCollaboration agreement revenue is income from agreements under which we provide biotherapeutic delivery systems and customer training and support for their use in clinical trials and studies. We evaluate activities under these agreements to determine if they represent a multiple element arrangement by identifying the deliverables included within the agreement. We account for these deliverables as separate units of accounting if the following two criteria are met.\n\u00b0\nthe delivered items have value to the customer on a stand-alone basis; and\n\u00b0\nif there is a general right of return relative to the delivered items, delivery or performance of the undelivered items is considered probable and within our control.\nFactors considered in this determination include, among other things, whether any other vendors sell the items separately and if the customer could use the delivered item for its intended purpose without receipt of the remaining deliverables. A change in these assumptions could impact our reported revenue, which could have a material impact to our financial statements.\nIf multiple deliverables included in an arrangement are separable into different units of accounting, we allocate the arrangement consideration to those units of accounting based on their relative selling prices and recognize the associated revenue when the appropriate recognition criteria are met for those deliverables. The amount of allocable arrangement consideration is limited to the amounts that are fixed and determinable.\nResearch and Development\u2014Clinical Trial Accruals\nAs part of the process of preparing our financial statements, we are required to estimate our expenses resulting from our obligations under contracts with vendors and consultants and clinical site agreements in connection with conducting clinical trials. The financial terms of these contracts are subject to negotiations which vary from contract to contract and may result in payment flows that do not match the periods over which materials or services are provided to us under such contracts. Our clinical trial accrual is dependent upon the timely and accurate reporting of expenses of our CROs and other third-party vendors.\nOur objective is to reflect the appropriate clinical trial expenses in our financial statements by matching those expenses with the period in which services and efforts are expended. We account for these expenses according to the progress of the trial as measured by patient progression and the timing of various aspects of the trial. We determine accrual estimates through discussion with applicable personnel and outside service providers as to the progress or state of completion of clinical trials, or the services completed. During the course of a clinical trial, we adjust the rate of clinical trial expense recognition if actual results differ from the estimates. We make estimates of our accrued expenses as of each balance sheet date in our financial statements based on facts and circumstances known at that time. Although we do not expect that our estimates will be materially different from amounts actually incurred, our understanding of status and timing of services performed relative to the actual status and timing of services performed may vary and may result in our reporting amounts that are too high or too low for any particular period. Through December 31, 2016, there had been no material adjustments to our prior period estimates of accrued expenses for clinical trials. However, due to the nature of estimates, we cannot provide assurance that we will not make changes to our estimates in the future as we become aware of additional information about the status or conduct of our clinical trials.\nS\nhare\n-Based Compensation\nBioCardia Lifesciences granted share-based compensation under its 2002 Stock Plan and 2016 Plan, which were assumed by the Company in connection with the Merger. The exercise price of options granted in 2016 was equivalent to the fair market value of BioCardia Lifesciences stock at the date of grant. The number of shares, terms, and vesting periods are determined by BioCardia\u2019s board of directors or a committee thereof on an option-by-option basis. Options generally vest ratably over service periods of four years and expire 10 years from the date of grant. Compensation cost for employee share-based awards is based on the grant-date fair value and will be recognized over the vesting period of the applicable award on a straight-line basis.\n67\nWe measure and recognize share-based compensation expense for equity awards to employees, directors and consultants based on fair value at the grant date. The unearned portion of nonemployee awards are remeasured at each reporting date. We use the Black-Scholes-Merton option-pricing model, or BSM, to calculate fair value. Share-based compensation expense recognized in the statements of operations is based on options ultimately expected to vest, taking into consideration estimated forfeitures, and is recognized in the period the services are performed. Share-based compensation expense is revised in subsequent periods, if necessary, if actual forfeitures differ from these estimates. When estimating forfeitures, we consider historic voluntary termination behaviors as well as trends of actual option forfeitures. For options granted to nonemployees, we revalue the unearned portion of the share-based compensation and the resulting change in fair value is recognized in the statements of operations over the period the related services are rendered.\nThe BSM option-pricing model requires the input of subjective assumptions, including the risk-free interest rate, the expected volatility in the value of our Common Stock, and the expected term of the option. These estimates involve inherent uncertainties and the application of management\u2019s judgment. If factors change and different assumptions are used, our share-based compensation expense could be materially different in the future.\nIncome Taxes\nWe use the asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes. Under this method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the differences between the financial reporting and the tax bases of assets and liabilities and are measured using the enacted tax rates and laws that will be in effect when the differences are expected to reverse. We assess the likelihood that the resulting deferred tax assets will be realized. A valuation allowance is provided when it is more likely than not that some portion or all of a deferred tax asset will not be realized.\nAs of December 31, 2016, our total deferred tax assets, less our total deferred tax liabilities, were $21.6 million. Due to our lack of earnings history and uncertainties surrounding our ability to generate future taxable income, the net deferred tax assets have been fully offset by a valuation allowance. The deferred tax assets were primarily comprised of federal and state tax net operating losses and tax credit carryforwards.\nUtilization of the net operating loss carryforwards may be subject to a substantial annual limitation due to ownership changes that may have occurred or that could occur in the future, as required by Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, or the Code, and similar state provisions. These ownership change limitations may limit the amount of net operating loss carryforwards and other tax attributes that can be utilized annually to offset future taxable income and tax, respectively. In general, an ownership change as defined by Section 382 of the Code results from a transaction or series of transactions over a three-year period resulting in an ownership change of more than 50 percentage points (by value) of the outstanding stock of a company by certain stockholders. Since our formation, we have raised capital through the issuance of capital stock on several occasions and we consummated the Merger in October 2016. These transactions, separately or combined with the purchasing stockholders\u2019 subsequent disposition of those shares, may have resulted in such ownership changes, or could result in ownership changes in the future.\nWe have not performed an analysis to assess whether an ownership change has occurred. If we have experienced an ownership change at any time since our formation, utilization of our net operating loss carryforwards would be subject to an annual limitation under Section 382 of the Code, which is determined by first multiplying the value of our stock at the time of the ownership change by the applicable long-term, tax-exempt rate, and then applying any additional adjustments that are required. Any limitation may result in expiration of a portion of the net operating loss carryforwards before utilization. Further, until a study is completed and any limitation known, no amounts are being considered as an uncertain tax position or disclosed as an unrecognized tax benefit. Due to the existence of the valuation allowance, future changes in our unrecognized tax benefits will not impact our effective tax rate. Any carryforwards that will expire prior to utilization as a result of such limitations will be removed from deferred tax assets, with a corresponding reduction of the valuation allowance.\n68\nResults of Operations\nThe following table summarizes our results of operations for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015 (in thousands).\nYears Ended December 31,\n2016\n2015\nRevenue.\nNet product revenue\n$517\n$860\nCollaboration agreement revenue\n59\n44\nTotal revenue\n576\n904\nCost and expenses.\nCost of goods sold\n746\n1,061\nResearch and development\n3,330\n1,518\nSelling, general and administrative\n4,108\n3,734\nTotal cost and expenses\n8,184\n6,313\nOperating loss\n(7,608\n)\n(5,409\n)\nWrite-off of deferred financing costs\n-\n(1,634\n)\nInterest expense\n(1,736\n)\n(1,386\n)\nOther income (expense)\n(966\n)\n1,732\nNet loss\n$(10,310\n)\n$(6,697\n)\nRevenue.\nRevenue decreased by approximately $328,000 in 2016 compared to 2015 primarily due to a reduction in sales volumes for Morph products subsequent to the reduction in the sales and production workforce in August 2015. We expect sales in 2017 to be generally consistent with 2016.\nCost of Goods Sold.\nCost of goods sold decreased by approximately $315,000 in 2016 compared to 2015 consistent with the reduction in revenue.\nResearch and Development Expenses.\nResearch and development expenses increased by approximately $1.9 million in 2016 compared to 2015 primarily due to expenses incurred in the planning and preparation for the CardiAMP Phase III pivotal trial. We expect research and development expenses to increase as we increase enrollment of the CardiAMP Phase III pivotal trial.\nSelling, General and Administrative Expenses.\nSelling, general and administrative expenses increased by approximately $312,000 in 2016 compared to 2015 primarily due to indirect costs associated with the Merger and expenses incurred to transition to public company operations, including legal costs, audit, accounting, tax, valuation service and financial printing. We expect selling, general and administrative expenses to increase due to expenses to be incurred as we build our infrastructure to support the CardiAMP Phase III pivotal trial and enhance public company operations.\nWrite Off of Deferred Financing Costs.\nThe Company deferred costs incurred for a planned initial public offering by BioCardia Lifesciences, or the IPO, which included legal, accounting and other professional fees. The IPO was delayed and subsequently withdrawn, and as a result, the Company recorded a write-off of deferred offering costs of $1.6 million during the year ended December 31, 2015.\nInterest Expense.\nInterest expense for the year ended December 31, 2016 and 2015 consisted primarily of interest expense related to convertible notes. The increase is attributable to longer period of principle outstanding in 2016.\n69\nOther Income (Expense).\nOther income (expense) for the year ended December 31, 2016 and 2015 consisted primarily of the changes in value of the convertible preferred stock warrant liabilities and the change in value of the convertible shareholder note derivative liability.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nWe have incurred net losses each year since our inception and as of December 31, 2016, we had an accumulated deficit of approximately $60.1 million. We anticipate that we will continue to incur net losses for at least the next several years.\nOn October 24, 2016, we issued convertible notes with net proceeds of $4.4 million. The convertible notes converted to common stock immediately prior to the Merger close. Also, we acquired $18.9 million in cash as a result of the Merger. Prior to that time, we have funded our operations principally through the sales of equity and convertible debt securities. As of December 31, 2016, we had cash and cash equivalents of approximately $21.4 million.\nThe following table shows a summary of our cash flows for the periods indicated (in thousands).\nYears Ended\nDecember 31,\n2016\n2015\nNet cash provided by (used in).\nOperating activities\n$(5,522\n)\n$(7,023\n)\nInvesting activities\n18,921\n(125\n)\nFinancing activities\n4,396\n7,521\nNet increase in cash and cash equivalents\n$17,795\n$373\nCash Flows from Operating Activities\n.    The decrease in overall spending for operating activities of approximately $1.5 million in 2016 compared to 2015 relates primarily to the spending for the anticipated IPO in 2015 coupled with reductions in operating costs attributable to the reduction in workforce that occurred in August 2015.\nCash Flows from Investing Activities\n.     Net cash provided by investing activities of $18.9 million during the year ended December 31, 2016 primarily consists of $19.0 million acquired from an accounting perspective as part of the Merger. We had no significant investing activities during the year ended December 31, and 2015.\nCash Flows from Financing Activities\n.    Net cash provided by financing activities of $4.3 million during the year ended December 31, 2016 primarily the result of proceeds from the issuance of convertible notes. Net cash provided by financing activities of $7.5 million during the year ended December 31, 2015 was primarily the result of proceeds from the issuance of convertible notes.\nFuture Funding Requirements\nTo date, we have generated modest revenue from sales of our approved products. We do not know when, or if, we will generate any revenue from our development stage biotherapeutic programs. We do not expect to generate any revenue from sales of our CardiAMP or CardiALLO therapeutic candidates unless and until we obtain regulatory approval. At the same time, we expect our expenses to increase in connection with our ongoing development activities, particularly as we continue the research, development and clinical trials of, and seek regulatory approval for, our therapeutic candidates. In addition, subject to obtaining regulatory approval for any of our therapeutic candidates and companion diagnostic, we expect to incur significant commercialization expenses for product sales, marketing, manufacturing and distribution. We anticipate that we will need additional funding in connection with our continuing operations.\nBased upon our current operating plan, we believe that the cash on hand will enable us to fund our operations for at least the next 12 months from the date of issuance of these financial statements. We have based our estimates on assumptions that may prove to be wrong, and we may use our available capital resources sooner than we currently expect. Because of the numerous risks and uncertainties associated with the development and commercialization of our therapeutic candidates, we are unable to estimate the amounts of increased capital outlays and operating expenditures necessary to complete the development of our therapeutic candidates.\n70\nOur future capital requirements will depend on many factors, including.\n\u2022\nthe progress, costs, results and timing of our CardiAMP and CardiALLO clinical trials;\n\u2022\nFDA acceptance of our CardiAMP and CardiALLO therapies for heart failure and for other potential indications;\n\u2022\nthe outcome, costs and timing of seeking and obtaining FDA and any other regulatory approvals;\n\u2022\nthe costs associated with securing, establishing and maintaining commercialization and manufacturing capabilities;\n\u2022\nthe number and characteristics of product candidates that we pursue, including our product candidates in preclinical development;\n\u2022\nthe ability of our product candidates to progress through clinical development successfully;\n\u2022\nour need to expand our research and development activities;\n\u2022\nthe costs of acquiring, licensing or investing in businesses, products, product candidates and technologies;\n\u2022\nour ability to maintain, expand and defend the scope of our intellectual property portfolio, including the amount and timing of any payments we may be required to make, or that we may receive, in connection with the licensing, filing, prosecution, defense and enforcement of any patents or other intellectual property rights;\n\u2022\nthe general and administrative expenses related to being a public company;\n\u2022\nour need and ability to hire additional management and scientific, medical and sales personnel;\n\u2022\nthe effect of competing technological and market developments; and\n\u2022\nour need to implement additional internal systems and infrastructure, including financial and reporting systems.\nUntil such time that we can generate meaningful revenue from the sales of approved therapies and products, if ever, we expect to finance our operating activities through public or private equity or debt financings, government or other third-party funding, marketing and distribution arrangements, and other collaborations, strategic alliances and licensing arrangements or a combination of these approaches. To the extent that we raise additional capital through the sale of equity or convertible debt securities, the ownership interests of our Common Stock holders will be diluted, and the terms of these securities may include liquidation or other preferences that adversely affect the rights of our Common Stock holders. Debt financing, if available, may involve agreements that include conversion discounts or covenants limiting or restricting our ability to take specific actions, such as incurring additional debt, making capital expenditures or declaring dividends. If we raise additional funds through government or other third-party funding, marketing and distribution arrangements or other collaborations, or strategic alliances or licensing arrangements with third parties, we may have to relinquish valuable rights to our technologies, future revenue streams, research programs, products or therapeutic candidates or to grant licenses on terms that may not be favorable to us.\n71\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nDuring the periods presented, we did not have, nor do we currently have, any off-balance sheet arrangements as defined under the rules of the Securities and Exchange Commission.\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\nIn May 2014, the FASB issued ASU No. 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606), which provides comprehensive guidance for revenue recognition. ASU 2014-09 affects any entity which either enters into contracts with customers to transfer goods or services or enters into contracts for the transfer of nonfinancial assets. The core principle of the guidance provides that a company should recognize revenue when promised goods or services are transferred to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. Additionally, qualitative and quantitative disclosures are required about customer contracts, significant judgments and changes in judgments, and assets recognized from the costs to obtain or fulfill a contract. The new standard can be applied retrospectively to each prior reporting period presented or retrospectively with the cumulative effect of the change recognized at the date of the initial application in retained earnings.\nIn August 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-14 Revenue from Contracts with Customers, which deferred the effective date for implementation of the standard. Public entities are to apply the new standard for annual and interim reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017 and earlier application is permitted only as of annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2016, including interim reporting periods within that reporting period. The Company has not elected early adoption and has not concluded on an adoption method. The Company has formed a task force that is beginning to assess the Company\u2019s customer contracts and the potential impacts the standard may have on previously reported revenues and future revenues.\nGiven the relatively small volume of revenue arrangements, the Company believes that the analysis will be completed in sufficient time to adopt the new standard when required.\nIn February 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-02 Leases (Topic 842), which supersedes existing guidance on accounting for leases in \u201cLeases (Topic 840)\u201d and generally requires all leases to be recognized in the consolidated balance sheet. ASU 2016-02 is effective for annual and interim reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2018; early adoption is permitted. The provisions of ASU 2016-02 are to be applied using a modified retrospective approach. We are currently assessing the future impact of this ASU on our consolidated financial statements.\nIn March 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-09, Compensation - Stock Compensation (Topic 718): Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting. The standard is intended to simplify several areas of accounting for share-based compensation arrangements, including the income tax impact, classification in the statement of cash flows and forfeitures. ASU 2016-09 is effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those years, beginning after December 15, 2016, and early adoption is permitted. We will adopt this guidance, when required. The adoption of this guidance is not expected to have a material impact on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows.","33":"","34":"ITEM 7\nManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis\nof Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nINDEX TO MD&A\nPage\nPage\nGeneral\n25\nResults of Operations \u2014 Fourth Quarter\n49\nOverview\n25\nSegmented Statement of Earnings\n49\nCritical Accounting Policies\n26\nProperty and Casualty Insurance\n50\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\n26\nAnnuity\n59\nRatios\n26\nRun-off Long-Term Care and Life\n66\nCondensed Consolidated Cash Flows\n27\nHolding Company, Other and Unallocated\n67\nParent and Subsidiary Liquidity\n28\nResults of Operations \u2014 Full Year\n70\nCondensed Parent Only Cash Flows\n30\nSegmented Statement of Earnings\n70\nContractual Obligations\n31\nProperty and Casualty Insurance\n72\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\n31\nAnnuity\n82\nInvestments\n31\nRun-off Long-Term Care and Life\n91\nUncertainties\n36\nHolding Company, Other and Unallocated\n92\nManaged Investment Entities\n42\nRecent and Pending Accounting Standards\n95\nResults of Operations\n47\nGeneral\n47\nGENERAL\nFollowing is a discussion and analysis of the financial statements and other statistical data that management believes will enhance the understanding of AFG\u2019s financial condition and results of operations. This discussion should be read in conjunction with the financial statements beginning on page F-1.\nOVERVIEW\nFinancial Condition\nAFG is organized as a holding company with almost all of its operations being conducted by subsidiaries. AFG, however, has continuing cash needs for administrative expenses, the payment of principal and interest on borrowings, shareholder dividends, and taxes. Therefore, certain analyses are most meaningfully presented on a parent only basis while others are best done on a total enterprise basis. In addition, because most of its businesses are financial in nature, AFG does not prepare its consolidated financial statements using a current-noncurrent format. Consequently, certain traditional ratios and financial analysis tests are not meaningful.\nAt\nDecember 31, 2016\n, AFG (parent) held approximately $260 million in cash and securities and had\n$500 million\navailable under a bank line of credit, which expires in June 2021.\nResults of Operations\nThrough the operations of its subsidiaries, AFG is engaged primarily in property and casualty insurance, focusing on specialized commercial products for businesses, and in the sale of fixed and fixed-indexed annuities in the retail, financial institutions and education markets.\nFourth quarter\n2016\nnet earnings attributable to AFG\u2019s shareholders were\n$385 million\n(\n$4.33\nper share, diluted) compared to\n$129 million\n(\n$1.45\nper share, diluted) in the fourth quarter of\n2015\n, reflecting.\n\u2022\nhigher underwriting profit and net investment income in the property and casualty insurance segment,\n\u2022\nhigher earnings in the annuity segment,\n\u2022\nthe fourth quarter 2016 tax benefits from the National Interstate merger and Neon restructuring,\n\u2022\nthe fourth quarter 2015 gain on the sale of an apartment property, and\n\u2022\nnet realized gains on securities in the fourth quarter of 2016 compared to net realized losses in the fourth quarter of 2015.\n25\nTable of Contents\nFull year\n2016\nnet earnings attributable to AFG\u2019s shareholders were\n$649 million\n(\n$7.33\nper share, diluted) compared to\n$352 million\n(\n$3.94\nper share, diluted) in\n2015\n, reflecting.\n\u2022\nhigher underwriting profit and net investment income in the property and casualty insurance segment,\n\u2022\nhigher earnings in the annuity segment,\n\u2022\nlower profitability in the run-off long-term care and life segment,\n\u2022\nnet realized gains on securities in 2016 compared to net realized losses on securities in 2015,\n\u2022\nthe 2015 loss on the sale of substantially all of AFG\u2019s run-off long-term care business,\n\u2022\nthe second quarter 2016 gain on the sale of an apartment property, which was less than the second quarter 2015 gain on the sale of a hotel and the fourth quarter 2015 gain on the sale of an apartment property, and\n\u2022\nthe fourth quarter 2016 tax benefits related to the National Interstate merger and Neon restructuring.\nCRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES\nSignificant accounting policies are summarized in\nNote\nA\n\u2014 \u201cAccounting Policies\u201d\nto the financial statements. The preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that can have a significant effect on amounts reported in the financial statements. As more information becomes known, these estimates and assumptions change and, thus, impact amounts reported in the future. The areas where management believes the degree of judgment required to determine amounts recorded in the financial statements is most significant are as follows.\n\u2022\nthe establishment of insurance reserves, especially asbestos and environmental-related reserves,\n\u2022\nthe recoverability of reinsurance,\n\u2022\nthe recoverability of deferred acquisition costs,\n\u2022\nthe establishment of asbestos and environmental reserves of former railroad and manufacturing operations, and\n\u2022\nthe valuation of investments, including the determination of other-than-temporary impairments.\nSee\n\u201cLiquidity and Capital Resources \u2014\nUncertainties\n\u201d\nfor a discussion of insurance reserves, recoverables from reinsurers, and contingencies related to American Premier\u2019s former operations and\n\u201cLiquidity and Capital Resources \u2014\nInvestments\n\u201d\nfor a discussion of impairments on investments. Deferred policy acquisition costs (\u201cDPAC\u201d) and certain liabilities related to annuities are amortized in relation to the present value of expected gross profits on the policies. Assumptions considered in determining expected gross profits involve significant judgment and include management\u2019s estimates of interest rates and investment spreads, surrenders, annuitizations, renewal premiums and mortality. Should actual experience require management to change its assumptions (commonly referred to as \u201cunlocking\u201d), a charge or credit would be recorded to adjust DPAC or annuity liabilities to the levels they would have been if the new assumptions had been used from the inception date of each policy.\nLIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES\nRatios\nAFG\u2019s debt to total capital ratio on a consolidated basis is shown below (dollars in millions). Management intends to maintain the ratio of debt to capital at or below 25% and intends to maintain the capital of its significant insurance subsidiaries at or above levels currently indicated by rating agencies as appropriate for the current ratings.\nDecember 31,\n2016\n2015\nPrincipal amount of long-term debt\n$1,308\n$1,020\nTotal capital\n5,921\n5,512\nRatio of debt to total capital.\nIncluding subordinated debt and debt secured by real estate\n22.1%\n18.5%\nExcluding subordinated debt and debt secured by real estate\n17.0%\n13.1%\nThe ratio of debt to total capital is a non-GAAP measure that management believes is useful for investors, analysts and independent ratings agencies to evaluate AFG\u2019s financial strength and liquidity and to provide insight into how AFG finances its operations. In addition, maintaining a ratio of debt, excluding subordinated debt and debt secured by real estate, to total capital of 35% or lower is a financial covenant in AFG\u2019s bank credit facility. The ratio is calculated by dividing the principal amount of AFG\u2019s long-term debt by its total capital, which includes long-term debt, noncontrolling interests and shareholders\u2019 equity (excluding unrealized gains (losses) on fixed maturity investments).\n26\nTable of Contents\nAFG\u2019s ratio of earnings to fixed charges, including annuity benefits as a fixed charge, was\n1.85\nfor the year ended\nDecember 31, 2016\n. Excluding annuity benefits, this ratio was\n8.62\n. Although the ratio excluding annuity benefits is not required or encouraged to be disclosed under Securities and Exchange Commission rules, it is presented because interest credited to annuity policyholder accounts is not always considered a borrowing cost for an insurance company.\nThe NAIC\u2019s model law for risk based capital (\u201cRBC\u201d) applies to both life and property and casualty companies. RBC formulas determine the amount of capital that an insurance company needs so that it has an acceptable expectation of not becoming financially impaired. At\nDecember 31, 2016\n, the capital ratios of all AFG insurance companies substantially exceeded the RBC requirements.\nCondensed Consolidated Cash Flows\nAFG\u2019s principal sources of cash include insurance premiums, income from its investment portfolio and proceeds from the maturities, redemptions and sales of investments. Insurance premiums in excess of acquisition expenses and operating costs are invested until they are needed to meet policyholder obligations or made available to the parent company through dividends to cover debt obligations and corporate expenses, and to provide returns to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends. Cash flows from operating, investing and financing activities as detailed in AFG\u2019s Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows are shown below (in millions).\nYear ended December 31,\n2016\n2015\n2014\nNet cash provided by operating activities\n$1,150\n$1,353\n$1,231\nNet cash used in investing activities\n(2,981\n)\n(4,573\n)\n(3,628\n)\nNet cash provided by financing activities\n2,718\n3,097\n2,101\nNet change in cash and cash equivalents\n$887\n$(123\n)\n$(296\n)\nNet Cash Provided by Operating Activities\nAFG\u2019s property and casualty insurance operations typically produce positive net operating cash flows as premiums collected and investment income exceed policy acquisition costs, claims payments and operating expenses. AFG\u2019s net cash provided by operating activities is impacted by the level and timing of property and casualty premiums, claim and expense payments and recoveries from reinsurers. AFG\u2019s annuity operations typically produce positive net operating cash flows as investment income exceeds acquisition costs and operating expenses. Interest credited on annuity policyholder funds is a non-cash increase in AFG\u2019s annuity benefits accumulated liability and annuity premiums, benefits and withdrawals are considered financing activities due to the deposit-type nature of annuities. Net cash provided by operating activities was\n$1.15 billion\n,\n$1.35 billion\nand\n$1.23 billion\nin\n2016\n,\n2015\nand\n2014\n, respectively.\nNet Cash Used in Investing Activities\nAFG\u2019s investing activities consist primarily of the investment of funds provided by its property and casualty and annuity products. Net cash used in investing activities was\n$2.98 billion\nin\n2016\ncompared to\n$4.57 billion\nin\n2015\n,\na decrease\nof\n$1.59 billion\n. The\n$151 million\ndecrease\nin net cash flows from annuity policyholders in\n2016\nas compared to\n2015\n(discussed below under net cash provided by financing activities) decreased the amount of cash available for investment in\n2016\ncompared to\n2015\n. In addition, AFG\u2019s cash on hand\nincreased\nby\n$887 million\nduring\n2016\n, primarily in the property and casualty and annuity segments reflecting the timing of investing available cash in those segments. Investing activities also include the purchase and disposal of managed investment entity investments (collateralized loan obligations), which are presented separately in AFG\u2019s Balance Sheet.

Redemptions of long-term debt was an $18 million use of cash in 2016 and a $192 million use of cash in 2015. During\n2016\n, AFG repurchased\n$133 million\nof its Common Stock compared to\n$126 million\nrepurchased in\n2015\n, which accounted for a\n$7 million\ndecrease in net cash provided by financing activities in\n2016\ncompared to\n2015\n.

If funds generated from operations, including dividends, tax payments and borrowings from subsidiaries, are insufficient to meet fixed charges in any period, AFG would be required to utilize parent company cash and marketable securities or to generate cash through borrowings, sales of other assets, or similar transactions.\nIn June 2016, AFG replaced its bank credit facility with a five-year,\n$500 million\nrevolving credit line. Amounts borrowed under this agreement bear interest at rates ranging from 1.00% to 1.875% (currently 1.375%) over LIBOR based on AFG\u2019s credit rating. There were no borrowings under this agreement, or under any other parent company short-term borrowing arrangements, during\n2016.\nOn November 10, 2016, AFG acquired the 49% of National Interstate Corporation (\u201cNATL\u201d) not previously owned by AFG\u2019s wholly-owned subsidiary, Great American Insurance Company (\u201cGAI\u201d) for $315 million ($32.00 per share) in cash in a merger transaction. In addition, NATL paid a one-time special cash dividend of $0.50 per share to its shareholders immediately prior to the merger closing ($5 million was paid to noncontrolling shareholders). See\nNote\nB\n\u2014 \u201c\nAcquisitions and Sale of Businesses\n\u201d\nto the financial statements.\nIn August 2016, AFG issued $300 million of 3.50% Senior Notes due 2026. AFG used the net proceeds from the offering to fund a portion of the acquisition of NATL mentioned above.\nDuring 2016, AFG repurchased 1.9 million shares of its Common Stock for $133 million. In December 2016, AFG paid a special cash dividend of $1.00 per share of AFG Common Stock totaling approximately $87 million.\nIn November 2015, AFG issued $150 million of 6% Subordinated Debentures due 2055. In September 2015, AFG redeemed its $132 million of 7% Senior Notes due 2050 at par using cash on hand at the parent company.\nDuring 2015, AFG repurchased 2.0 million shares of its Common Stock for $126 million. In December 2015, AFG paid a special cash dividend of $1.00 per share of AFG Common Stock totaling approximately $88 million.\nIn April 2014, AFG completed the purchase of Summit Holding Southeast, Inc. and its related companies (\u201cSummit\u201d) from Liberty Mutual Insurance for $259 million using cash on hand at the parent company. In addition, AFG made a capital contribution of approximately $140 million, bringing its capital investment in the Summit business to $399 million. Summit\u2019s results of operations are included in AFG\u2019s consolidated results beginning in April of 2014.\n28\nTable of Contents\nIn September 2014, AFG issued $150 million of 6-1\/4% Subordinated Debentures due 2054. During 2014, AFG repurchased 3.3 million shares of its Common Stock for $191 million. In December 2014, AFG paid a special cash dividend of $1.00 per share of AFG Common Stock totaling approximately $88 million.\nAll debentures and notes issued by AFG are rated investment grade by two nationally recognized rating agencies. Under a currently effective shelf registration statement, AFG can offer additional equity or debt securities. The shelf registration provides AFG with flexibility to access the capital markets from time to time as market and other conditions permit.\nUnder a tax allocation agreement with AFG, its 80%-owned U.S. subsidiaries generally pay taxes to (or recover taxes from) AFG based on each subsidiary\u2019s contribution to amounts due under AFG\u2019s consolidated tax return.\nSubsidiary Liquidity\nGreat American Life Insurance Company (\u201cGALIC\u201d), a wholly-owned annuity subsidiary, is a member of the Federal Home Loan Bank of Cincinnati (\u201cFHLB\u201d). The FHLB makes advances and provides other banking services to member institutions, which provides the annuity operations with an additional source of liquidity. These advances further the FHLB\u2019s mission of improving access to housing by increasing liquidity in the residential mortgage-backed securities market. At\nDecember 31, 2016\n, GALIC had $935 million in outstanding advances from the FHLB (included in annuity benefits accumulated), bearing interest at rates ranging from 0.03% to 0.53% over LIBOR (average rate of 1.18% at\nDecember 31, 2016\n). In the fourth quarter of 2016, GALIC extended the terms on advances totaling $200 million by four years. While these advances must be repaid between\n2018\nand\n2021\n(\n$285 million\nin 2018,\n$500 million\nin 2020 and\n$150 million\nin 2021), GALIC has the option to prepay all or a portion of the advances. GALIC has invested the proceeds from the advances in fixed maturity securities with similar expected lives as the advances for the purpose of earning a spread over the interest payments due to the FHLB. At\nDecember 31, 2016\n, GALIC estimated that it had additional borrowing capacity of approximately $300 million from the FHLB.\nThe liquidity requirements of AFG\u2019s insurance subsidiaries relate primarily to the liabilities associated with their products as well as operating costs and expenses, payments of dividends and taxes to AFG and contributions of capital to their subsidiaries. Historically, cash flows from premiums and investment income have generally provided more than sufficient funds to meet these requirements. Funds received in excess of cash requirements are generally invested in additional marketable securities. In addition, the insurance subsidiaries generally hold a significant amount of highly liquid, short-term investments.\nThe excess cash flow of AFG\u2019s property and casualty group allows it to extend the duration of its investment portfolio somewhat beyond that of its claim reserves.\nIn the annuity business, where profitability is largely dependent on earning a spread between invested assets and annuity liabilities, the duration of investments is generally maintained close to that of liabilities. In a rising interest rate environment, significant protection from withdrawals exists in the form of temporary and permanent surrender charges on AFG\u2019s annuity products. With declining rates, AFG receives some protection (from spread compression) due to the ability to lower crediting rates, subject to contractually guaranteed minimum interest rates (\u201cGMIRs\u201d). AFG began selling policies with GMIRs below 2% in 2003; almost all new business since late 2010 has been issued with a 1% GMIR. At\nDecember 31, 2016\n, AFG could reduce the average crediting rate on approximately\n$22 billion\nof traditional fixed and fixed-indexed annuities without guaranteed withdrawal benefits by approximately\n80\nbasis points (on a weighted average basis). Annuity policies are subject to GMIRs at policy issuance. The table below shows the breakdown of annuity reserves by GMIR. The current interest crediting rates on substantially all of AFG\u2019s annuities with a GMIR of 3% or higher are at their minimum.% of Reserves\nat December 31,\nGMIR\n2016\n2015\n1 \u2014 1.99%\n72%\n67%\n2 \u2014 2.99%\n6%\n7%\n3 \u2014 3.99%\n12%\n14%\n4.00% and above\n10%\n12%\nAnnuity benefits accumulated (in millions)\n$29,907\n$26,622\nAFG\u2019s weighted average cost of funds for newly issued traditional fixed and fixed-indexed annuities was 2.28% for 2016 compared to 2.31% for 2015. In the first half of 2016, AFG lowered the crediting rates on new annuity sales due to the decline in market investment yields experienced during that period. Conversely, AFG raised crediting rates on new annuity sales in the\n29\nTable of Contents\nlatter part of 2016 in response to rising market investment yields. In addition to lowering the cost of funds, AFG reduced certain commission rates and guaranteed withdrawal benefits on annuities sold in 2016.\nFor statutory accounting purposes, equity securities of non-affiliates and equity call options used in the fixed-indexed annuity business are generally carried at fair value. At\nDecember 31, 2016\n, AFG\u2019s insurance companies owned publicly traded equity securities with a fair value of $1.51 billion and equity call options with a fair value of $492 million. Decreases in market prices could adversely affect the insurance group\u2019s capital, potentially impacting the amount of dividends available or necessitating a capital contribution. Conversely, increases in market prices could have a favorable impact on the group\u2019s dividend-paying capability.\nAFG believes its insurance subsidiaries maintain sufficient liquidity to pay claims and benefits and operating expenses. In addition, these subsidiaries have sufficient capital to meet commitments in the event of unforeseen events such as reserve deficiencies, inadequate premium rates or reinsurer insolvencies. Nonetheless, changes in statutory accounting rules, significant declines in the fair value of the insurance subsidiaries\u2019 investment portfolios or significant ratings downgrades on these investments, could create a need for additional capital.\nCondensed Parent Only Cash Flows\nAFG\u2019s parent holding company only condensed cash flows from operating, investing and financing activities are shown below (in millions).\nYear ended December 31,\n2016\n2015\n2014\nNet cash provided by operating activities\n$555\n$162\n$372\nNet cash used in investing activities\n(560\n)\n(33\n)\n(432\n)\nNet cash provided by (used in) financing activities\n13\n(232\n)\n(171\n)\nNet change in cash and cash equivalents\n$8\n$(103\n)\n$(231\n)\nParent Net Cash Provided by Operating Activities\nParent holding company cash flows from operating activities consist primarily of dividends and tax payments received from AFG\u2019s insurance subsidiaries, reduced by tax payments to the IRS and holding company interest and other expenses. Parent holding company net cash provided by operating activities was\n$555 million\nin\n2016\ncompared to\n$162 million\nin\n2015\nand\n$372 million\nin\n2014\n. Higher dividends received from subsidiaries in\n2016\nas compared to\n2015\nwere the primary driver of the\n$393 million\nincrease\nin net cash provided by operating activities. The\n$210 million\ndecrease\nin net cash provided by operating activities in\n2015\nas compared to\n2014\nwas primarily the result of lower dividends received.\nParent Net Cash Used in Investing Activities\nParent holding company investing activities consist of capital contributions to and returns of capital from subsidiaries and, to a much lesser extent, parent company investment activity. Parent holding company net cash used in investing activities was\n$560 million\nin\n2016\ncompared to\n$33 million\nin\n2015\nand\n$432 million\nin\n2014\n. The\n$560 million\nin net cash used in investing activities in\n2016\nas compared to the\n$33 million\nin\n2015\nis significantly higher due primarily to increased capital contributions to a subsidiary to fund the acquisition of the noncontrolling interest in National Interstate Corporation. The $33 million of parent holding company net cash used in investing activities in\n2015\nwas significantly lower than the\n$432 million\nin net cash used in investing activities in\n2014\ndue primarily to capital contributions made to a subsidiary to fund the $399 million investment in Summit in 2014.\nParent Net Cash Provided by (Used in) Financing Activities\nParent company financing activities consist primarily of repurchases of AFG Common Stock, dividends to shareholders, the issuance and retirement of long-term debt and, to a lesser extent, proceeds from employee stock option exercises. Significant long-term debt and common stock transactions are discussed above under\n\u201c\nParent Holding Company Liquidity\n.\u201d\nParent holding company net cash provided by financing activities was\n$13 million\nin\n2016\ncompared to net cash used in financing activities of\n$232 million\nin\n2015\nand\n$171 million\nin\n2014\n. The\n$245 million\nincrease in net cash provided by financing activities in\n2016\nas compared to\n2015\nprimarily reflects proceeds from additional long-term borrowings. The\n$61 million\nincrease\nin net cash used in financing activities in\n2015\nas compared to\n2014\nreflects the 2015 redemption of $132 million of 7% Senior Notes due 2050, partially offset by a $65 million decrease in common stock repurchases.\n30\nTable of Contents\nContractual Obligations\nThe following table shows an estimate (based on historical patterns and expected trends) of payments to be made for insurance reserve liabilities, as well as scheduled payments for major contractual obligations (in millions).\nTotal\nWithin\nOne Year\n2-3 Years\n4-5 Years\nMore than\n5 Years\nAnnuities (a)\n$34,004\n$2,523\n$5,987\n$7,189\n$18,305\nLife, accident and health liabilities (a)\n1,545\n126\n226\n215\n978\nProperty and casualty unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses (b)\n8,563\n2,300\n2,200\n1,000\n3,063\nLong-term debt, including interest\n2,797\n85\n521\n119\n2,072\nOperating leases\n388\n66\n113\n82\n127\nTotal\n$47,297\n$5,100\n$9,047\n$8,605\n$24,545\n(a)\nAmounts presented in the table represent estimated cash payments under such contracts, based on significant assumptions related to mortality, morbidity, lapse, renewal, retirement and annuitization. These assumptions also include interest and index crediting consistent with assumptions used to amortize DPAC and assess loss recognition. All estimated cash payments are undiscounted for the time value of money. As a result, total outflows for all years exceed the corresponding liabilities of\n$29.91 billion\nfor annuity benefits accumulated and\n$691 million\nfor life, accident and health reserves included in AFG\u2019s Balance Sheet as of\nDecember 31, 2016\n. Based on the same assumptions, AFG projects reinsurance recoveries related to life, accident and health reserves totaling $769 million as follows: Within 1 year \u2014 $81 million; 2-3 years \u2014 $129 million; 4-5 years \u2014 $110 million; and thereafter \u2014 $449 million. Actual payments and their timing could differ significantly from these estimates.\n(b)\nDollar amounts and time periods are estimates based on historical net payment patterns applied to the gross reserves and do not represent actual contractual obligations. Based on the same assumptions, AFG projects reinsurance recoveries related to these reserves totaling $2.30 billion as follows: Within 1 year \u2014 $600 million; 2-3 years \u2014 $600 million; 4-5 years \u2014 $300 million; and thereafter \u2014 $800 million. Actual payments and their timing could differ significantly from these estimates.\nAFG has no material contractual purchase obligations or other long-term liabilities at\nDecember 31, 2016.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nSee\nNote\nP\n\u2014 \u201c\nAdditional Information\n\u2014\nFinancial Instruments \u2014 Unfunded Commitments\n\u201d\nto the financial statements.\nInvestments\nAFG attempts to optimize investment income while building the value of its portfolio, placing emphasis upon total long-term performance.\nAFG\u2019s investment portfolio at\nDecember 31, 2016\n, contained\n$34.54 billion\nin fixed maturity securities and\n$1.50 billion\nin equity securities classified as available for sale and carried at fair value with unrealized gains and losses included in a separate component of shareholders\u2019 equity on an after-tax basis. In addition,\n$359 million\nin fixed maturities and\n$56 million\nin equity securities were classified as trading with changes in unrealized holding gains or losses included in net investment income.\nAs detailed in\nNote\nE\n\u2014 \u201c\nInvestments\n\u2014\nNet Unrealized Gain on Marketable Securities\n\u201d\nto the financial statements, unrealized gains and losses on AFG\u2019s fixed maturity and equity securities are included in shareholders\u2019 equity after adjustments for related changes in DPAC and certain liabilities related to annuity, long-term care and life businesses, noncontrolling interests and deferred income taxes. DPAC and certain other balance sheet amounts applicable to annuity, long-term care and life businesses are adjusted for the impact of unrealized gains or losses on investments as if these gains or losses had been realized, with corresponding increases or decreases (net of tax) included in accumulated other comprehensive income in AFG\u2019s Balance Sheet.\nFixed income investment funds are generally invested in securities with intermediate-term maturities with an objective of optimizing total return while allowing flexibility to react to changes in market conditions. At\nDecember 31, 2016\n, the average life of AFG\u2019s fixed maturities was about 6-1\/2 years.\nFair values for AFG\u2019s portfolio are determined by AFG\u2019s internal investment professionals using data from nationally recognized pricing services as well as non-binding broker quotes. Fair values of equity securities are generally based on published closing prices. For mortgage-backed securities (\u201cMBS\u201d), which comprise approximately 15% of AFG\u2019s fixed maturities, prices for each security are generally obtained from both pricing services and broker quotes. For the remainder of AFG\u2019s fixed maturity portfolio, approximately 79% are priced using pricing services and the balance is priced primarily by\n31\nTable of Contents\nusing non-binding broker quotes. When prices obtained for the same security vary, AFG\u2019s internal investment professionals select the price they believe is most indicative of an exit price.\nThe pricing services use a variety of observable inputs to estimate fair value of fixed maturities that do not trade on a daily basis. Based upon information provided by the pricing services, these inputs include, but are not limited to, recent reported trades, benchmark yields, issuer spreads, bids or offers, reference data, and measures of volatility. Included in the pricing of MBS are estimates of the rate of future prepayments and defaults of principal over the remaining life of the underlying collateral. Due to the lack of transparency in the process that brokers use to develop prices, valuations that are based on brokers\u2019 prices are classified as Level 3 in the GAAP hierarchy unless the price can be corroborated, for example, by comparison to similar securities priced using observable inputs.\nValuation techniques utilized by pricing services and prices obtained from external sources are reviewed by AFG\u2019s internal investment professionals who are familiar with the securities being priced and the markets in which they trade to ensure the fair value determination is representative of an exit price. To validate the appropriateness of the prices obtained, these investment managers consider widely published indices (as benchmarks), recent trades, changes in interest rates, general economic conditions and the credit quality of the specific issuers. In addition, AFG communicates directly with pricing services regarding the methods and assumptions used in pricing, including verifying, on a test basis, the inputs used by the services to value specific securities.\nIn general, the fair value of AFG\u2019s fixed maturity investments is inversely correlated to changes in interest rates. The following table demonstrates the sensitivity of such fair values to reasonably likely changes in interest rates by illustrating the estimated effect on AFG\u2019s fixed maturity portfolio and accumulated other comprehensive income that an immediate increase of 100 basis points in the interest rate yield curve would have at\nDecember 31, 2016\n(dollars in millions). Effects of increases or decreases from the 100 basis points illustrated would be approximately proportional.\nFair value of fixed maturity portfolio\n$34,903\nPercentage impact on fair value of 100 bps increase in interest rates\n(5.0%)\nPretax impact on fair value of fixed maturity portfolio\n$(1,745\n)\nOffsetting adjustments to deferred policy acquisition costs and other balance sheet amounts\n700\nEstimated pretax impact on accumulated other comprehensive income\n(1,045\n)\nDeferred income tax\n366\nEstimated after-tax impact on accumulated other comprehensive income\n$(679\n)\nApproximately 89% of the fixed maturities held by AFG at\nDecember 31, 2016\n, were rated \u201cinvestment grade\u201d (credit rating of AAA to BBB) by nationally recognized rating agencies. Investment grade securities generally bear lower yields and lower degrees of risk than those that are unrated and non-investment grade. Management believes that the high quality investment portfolio should generate a stable and predictable investment return.\nMBS are subject to significant prepayment risk due to the fact that, in periods of declining interest rates, mortgages may be repaid more rapidly than scheduled as borrowers refinance higher rate mortgages to take advantage of lower rates. Although interest rates have been low in recent years, tighter lending standards have resulted in fewer buyers being able to refinance the mortgages underlying much of AFG\u2019s non-agency residential MBS portfolio.\n32\nTable of Contents\nSummarized information for AFG\u2019s MBS (including those classified as trading) at\nDecember 31, 2016\n, is shown in the table below (dollars in millions). Agency-backed securities are those issued by a U.S. government-backed agency; Alt-A mortgages are those with risk profiles between prime and subprime.

The determination of whether unrealized losses are other-than-temporary requires judgment based on subjective as well as objective factors.\nFactors considered and resources used by management include.\na)\nwhether the unrealized loss is credit-driven or a result of changes in market interest rates,\nb)\nthe extent to which fair value is less than cost basis,\nc)\ncash flow projections received from independent sources,\nd)\nhistorical operating, balance sheet and cash flow data contained in issuer SEC filings and news releases,\ne)\nnear-term prospects for improvement in the issuer and\/or its industry,\nf)\nthird party research and communications with industry specialists,\ng)\nfinancial models and forecasts,\nh)\nthe continuity of dividend payments, maintenance of investment grade ratings and hybrid nature of certain investments,\ni)\ndiscussions with issuer management, and\nj)\nability and intent to hold the investment for a period of time sufficient to allow for anticipated recovery in fair value.\n35\nTable of Contents\nBased on its analysis of the factors listed above, management believes AFG will recover its cost basis in the securities with unrealized losses and that AFG has the ability to hold the securities until they recover in value and had no intent to sell them at\nDecember 31, 2016\n. Although AFG has the ability to continue holding its investments with unrealized losses, its intent to hold them may change due to deterioration in the issuers\u2019 creditworthiness, decisions to lessen exposure to a particular issuer or industry, asset\/liability management decisions, market movements, changes in views about appropriate asset allocation or the desire to offset taxable realized gains. Should AFG\u2019s ability or intent change with regard to a particular security, a charge for impairment would likely be required. While it is not possible to accurately predict if or when a specific security will become impaired, charges for other-than-temporary impairment could be material to results of operations in future periods. Significant declines in the fair value of AFG\u2019s investment portfolio could have a significant adverse effect on AFG\u2019s liquidity. For information on AFG\u2019s realized gains (losses) on securities, including charges for other-than-temporary impairment, see\n\u201cResults of Operations \u2014\nConsolidated Realized Gains (Losses) on Securities\n.\u201d\nUncertainties\nAs more fully explained in the following paragraphs, management believes that the areas posing the greatest risk of material loss are the adequacy of its insurance reserves and contingencies arising out of its former railroad and manufacturing operations.\nProperty and Casualty Insurance Reserves\nEstimating the liability for unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses (\u201cLAE\u201d) is inherently judgmental and is influenced by factors that are subject to significant variation. Determining the liability is a complex process incorporating input from many areas of the Company including actuarial, underwriting, pricing, claims and operations management.\nThe estimates of liabilities for unpaid claims and for expenses of investigation and adjustment of unpaid claims are based upon: (i) the accumulation of case estimates for losses reported prior to the close of the accounting periods on direct business written (\u201ccase reserves\u201d); (ii) estimates received from ceding reinsurers and insurance pools and associations; (iii) estimates of claims incurred but not reported or \u201cIBNR\u201d (including possible development on known claims); (iv) estimates (based on experience) of expense for investigating and adjusting claims; and (v) the current state of law and coverage litigation.\nThe process used to determine the total reserve for liabilities involves estimating the ultimate incurred losses and LAE, adjusted for amounts already paid on the claims. The IBNR reserve is derived by first estimating the ultimate unpaid reserve liability and subtracting case reserves for loss and LAE. See\nNote\nO\n\u2014 \u201c\nInsurance\n\u2014\nProperty and Casualty Insurance Reserves\n\u201d\nto the financial statements for a discussion of the factors considered and actuarial methods used in determining management\u2019s best estimate of the ultimate liability for unpaid losses and LAE.\nThe following table shows (in millions) the breakdown of AFG\u2019s property and casualty reserves between case reserves, IBNR reserves and LAE reserves (estimated amounts required to adjust, record and settle claims, other than the claim payments themselves).\nGross Loss Reserves at December 31, 2016\nCase\nIBNR\nLAE\nTotal\nReserve\nStatutory Line of Business\nWorkers\u2019 compensation\n$1,054\n$1,274\n$337\n$2,665\nOther liability \u2014 occurrence\n551\n1,473\n350\n2,374\nOther liability \u2014 claims made\n154\n239\n183\n576\nCommercial auto\/truck liability\/medical\n214\n272\n84\n570\nSpecial property (fire, allied lines, inland marine, earthquake)\n318\n105\n32\n455\nProducts liability \u2014 occurrence\n78\n139\n130\n347\nCommercial multi-peril\n103\n76\n66\n245\nOther lines\n123\n304\n91\n518\nTotal Statutory Reserves\n2,595\n3,882\n1,273\n7,750\nAdjustments for GAAP.\nReserves of foreign operations\n347\n414\n40\n801\nDeferred gains on retroactive reinsurance\n\u2014\n32\n\u2014\n32\nLoss reserve discounting\n(10\n)\n\u2014\n\u2014\n(10\n)\nOther\n(10\n)\n\u2014\n\u2014\n(10\n)\nTotal Adjustments for GAAP\n327\n446\n40\n813\nTotal GAAP Reserves\n$2,922\n$4,328\n$1,313\n$8,563\n36\nTable of Contents\nWhile current factors and reasonably likely changes in variable factors are considered in estimating the liability for unpaid losses, there is no method or system that can eliminate the risk of actual ultimate results differing from such estimates.\nFollowing is a discussion of certain critical variables affecting the estimation of loss reserves of the more significant long-tail lines of business (asbestos and environmental liabilities are separately discussed below). Many other variables may also impact ultimate claim costs.\nAn important assumption underlying reserve estimates is that the cost trends implicitly built into development patterns will continue into the future. However, future results could vary due to an unexpected change in the underlying cost trends. This unexpected change could arise from a variety of sources including a general increase in economic inflation, inflation from social programs, new medical technologies, or other factors such as those listed below in connection with AFG\u2019s largest lines of business. It is not possible to isolate and measure the potential impact of just one of these variables, and future cost trends could be partially impacted by several such variables. However, it is reasonable to address the sensitivity of the reserves to potential impact from changes in these variables by measuring the effect of a possible overall 1% change in future cost trends that may be caused by one or more variables. Utilizing the effect of a 1% change in overall cost trends enables changes greater than 1% to be estimated by extrapolation. Each additional 1% change in the cost trend would increase the effect on net earnings by an amount slightly (about 5%) greater than the effect of the previous 1%. For example, if a 1% change in cost trends in a line of business would change net earnings by $20 million, a 2% change would change net earnings by approximately $41 million.\nThe estimated cumulative impact that a 1% change in cost trends in AFG\u2019s more significant lines of property and casualty business (exceeding 5% of total reserves) would have on net earnings is shown below (in millions).\nLine of business\nEffect of 1%\nChange in\nCost Trends\nWorkers\u2019 compensation\n$63\nOther liability \u2014 occurrence\n28\nCommercial auto\/truck liability\/medical\n7\nOther liability \u2014 claims made\n9\nThe judgments and uncertainties surrounding management\u2019s reserve estimation process and the potential for reasonably possible variability in management\u2019s most recent reserve estimates may also be viewed by looking at how recent historical estimates of reserves have developed. The following table shows (dollars in millions) what the impact on AFG\u2019s net earnings would be on the more significant lines of business if the\nDecember 31, 2016\n, reserves (net of reinsurance) developed at the same rate as the average development of the most recent five years.\n5-yr.

Some of the important variables affecting estimation of loss reserves for workers\u2019 compensation include.\n\u2022\nLegislative actions and regulatory and legal interpretations\n\u2022\nFuture medical cost inflation\n\u2022\nEconomic conditions\n\u2022\nTiming of claims reporting\n\u2022\nMedical advances and changes to life expectancies\n37\nTable of Contents\nIn April 2014, AFG acquired Summit Holding Southeast, Inc. and related companies, a leading provider of workers\u2019 compensation solutions in the southeastern United States. The Summit acquisition significantly increased AFG\u2019s volume of workers\u2019 compensation business and improved its geographic diversity. Approximately 24% and 18% of AFG\u2019s workers\u2019 compensation reserves at\nDecember 31, 2016\nrelate to policies written in Florida and California, respectively. Over the past 13 years in both states, there have been numerous revisions to workers\u2019 compensation regulations and operating environments, adding difficulty and uncertainty to the estimation of related liabilities.\nAFG recorded favorable prior year reserve development of $85 million in\n2016\ndue to lower than anticipated claim severity and improving claim closure rates. AFG recorded favorable prior year reserve development of $45 million in\n2015\ndue to lower than anticipated claim severity across all regions of the country. AFG recorded favorable prior year reserve development of $7 million in\n2014\n, as favorable reserve development in the business written in California was partially offset by adverse reserve development in other states.\nOther Liability \u2014 Occurrence\nThis long-tail line of business consists of coverages protecting the insured against legal liability resulting from negligence, carelessness, or a failure to act causing property damage or personal injury to others. Some of the important variables affecting estimation of loss reserves for other liability \u2014 occurrence include.\n\u2022\nLitigious climate\n\u2022\nUnpredictability of judicial decisions regarding coverage issues\n\u2022\nMagnitude of jury awards\n\u2022\nOutside counsel costs\n\u2022\nTiming of claims reporting\nAFG recorded adverse prior year reserve development of $61 million in\n2016\nrelated to its other liability \u2014 occurrence coverage due primarily to increased severity in New York contractor claims. AFG recorded favorable prior year reserve development of $7 million in\n2015\nand $15 million in\n2014\nas both the frequency and severity of claims in excess and umbrella liability coverages were lower than previously projected.\nWhile management applies the actuarial methods mentioned above, more judgment is involved in arriving at the final reserve to be held. For recent accident years, more weight is given to the Bornhuetter-Ferguson method.\nCommercial Auto\/Truck Liability\/Medical\nThis line of business is a mix of coverage protecting the insured against legal liability for property damage or personal injury to others arising from the operation of commercial motor vehicles. The property damage liability exposure is usually short-tail with relatively quick reporting and settlement of claims. The bodily injury and medical payments exposures are longer-tailed; although the claim reporting is relatively quick, the final settlement can take longer to achieve. Some of the important variables affecting estimation of loss reserves for commercial auto\/truck liability\/medical are similar to other liability \u2014 occurrence and include.\n\u2022\nMagnitude of jury awards\n\u2022\nUnpredictability of judicial decisions regarding coverage issues\n\u2022\nLitigious climate and trends\n\u2022\nChange in frequency of severe accidents\n\u2022\nHealth care costs and utilization of medical services by injured parties\nAFG recorded adverse prior year reserve development of $28 million in\n2016\n, $20 million in\n2015\nand $28 million in\n2014\nfor this line of business as claim severity has been significantly higher than expected in accident years 2010 and subsequent.\nOther Liability \u2014 Claims Made\nThis long-tail line of business consists mostly of directors\u2019 and officers\u2019 liability (\u201cD&O\u201d). Some of the important variables affecting estimation of loss reserves for other liability \u2014 claims made include.\n\u2022\nLitigious climate\n\u2022\nEconomic conditions\n\u2022\nVariability of stock prices\n\u2022\nMagnitude of jury awards\n38\nTable of Contents\nThe general state of the economy and the variability of the stock price of the insured can affect the frequency and severity of shareholder class action suits and other situations that trigger coverage under D&O policies. For example, from 2008 to 2010, economic conditions led to higher frequency of claims, particularly in the D&O policies for small account and not-for-profit organizations. Since then, claim frequency has continually decreased from its peak in 2010, offsetting increased claim severity.\nAFG recorded favorable prior year reserve development of $24 million in\n2016\n, $12 million in\n2015\nand $18 million in\n2014\non its D&O business as claim severity was less than expected across several prior accident years.\nReserves of Foreign Operations\nReserves of foreign operations relate primarily to the operations of Neon Underwriting Limited (\u201cNeon\u201d), AFG\u2019s wholly-owned United Kingdom-based Lloyd\u2019s insurer. Historically, the largest line of business written by Neon was non-U.S. medical malpractice, which provides coverage for injuries and damages caused by medical care providers, including but not limited to, hospitals and their physicians. Although Neon offered this product in approximately 30 countries, the majority of the business has been written in the United Kingdom, Australia and Italy. In addition, Neon writes marine, equine, professional indemnity, directors and officers liability, catastrophe and cyber insurance and previously offered general liability policies. Significant variables in estimating the loss reserves include.\n\u2022\nLitigious environment\n\u2022\nMagnitude of court awards\n\u2022\nA slow moving judicial system including varying approaches to medical malpractice claims among courts\n\u2022\nTrends in claim costs, including medical cost inflation\nDuring the second quarter of 2016, Neon completed a strategic review of its business under a new leadership team. As part of its strategic review, Neon sold and\/or exited certain historical lines of business including its medical malpractice and general liability classes. As a result of Neon\u2019s claims review of its exited lines of business, AFG recorded a charge of approximately $65 million, including $57 million to increase loss reserves (adverse development) primarily related to its medical malpractice and general liability lines. In addition to the exited lines charge, Neon recorded adverse prior year reserve development of $21 million in\n2016\n, $44 million in\n2015\nand $14 million in\n2014\n. The adverse development in 2016 outside of the exited lines charge was attributable to reserve strengthening in several lines of business, including political risk and personal accident. The adverse development in 2015 and 2014 was attributable to reserve strengthening in several lines of business, primarily Dutch hospital medical malpractice, Australian and other general liability and personal accident insurance.\nRecoverables from Reinsurers and Availability of Reinsurance\nAFG is subject to credit risk with respect to its reinsurers, as reinsurance contracts do not relieve AFG of its liability to policyholders. To mitigate this risk, substantially all reinsurance is ceded to companies with investment grade S&P ratings or is secured by \u201cfunds withheld\u201d or other collateral.\nThe availability and cost of reinsurance are subject to prevailing market conditions, which are beyond AFG\u2019s control and which may affect AFG\u2019s level of business and profitability. Although the cost of certain reinsurance programs may increase, management believes that AFG will be able to maintain adequate reinsurance coverage at acceptable rates without a material adverse effect on AFG\u2019s results of operations. AFG\u2019s gross and net combined ratios are shown in the table below.\nSee\nItem\n1\n\u2014\nBusiness\n\u2014 \u201c\nProperty and Casualty Insurance Segment\n\u2014\nReinsurance\n\u201d\nfor more information on AFG\u2019s reinsurance programs. For additional information on the effect of reinsurance on AFG\u2019s historical results of operations see\nNote\nO\n\u2014\n\u201c\nInsurance\n\u2014\nReinsurance\n\u201d\nto the financial statements.\nThe following table illustrates the effect that purchasing property and casualty reinsurance has had on AFG\u2019s combined ratio over the last three years.\n2016\n2015\n2014\nBefore reinsurance (gross)\n92.5%\n92.8%\n90.8%\nEffect of reinsurance\n2.0%\n1.9%\n3.7%\nActual (net of reinsurance)\n94.5%\n94.7%\n94.5%\nOutside of its property and casualty operations, AFG also has reinsurance recoverables totaling $343 million, including $296 million related to the run-off life business. These recoverables include $254 million directly or indirectly from Hannover Life Reassurance Company of America (rated A+ by A.M. Best).\n39\nTable of Contents\nAsbestos and Environmental-related (\u201cA&E\u201d) Insurance Reserves\nAsbestos and environmental reserves of the property and casualty group consisted of the following (in millions).\nDecember 31,\n2016\n2015\nAsbestos\n$198\n$205\nEnvironmental\n139\n122\nA&E reserves, net of reinsurance recoverable\n337\n327\nReinsurance recoverable, net of allowance\n106\n99\nGross A&E reserves\n$443\n$426\nAsbestos reserves include claims asserting alleged injuries and damages from exposure to asbestos. Environmental reserves include claims relating to polluted sites.\nAsbestos claims against manufacturers, distributors or installers of asbestos products were presented under the products liability section of their policies, which typically had aggregate limits that capped an insurer\u2019s liability. In recent years, a number of asbestos claims are being presented as \u201cnon-products\u201d claims, such as those by installers of asbestos products and by property owners or operators who allegedly had asbestos on their property, under the premises or operations section of their policies. Unlike products exposures, these non-products exposures typically had no aggregate limits, creating potentially greater exposure for insurers. Further, in an effort to seek additional insurance coverage, some insureds with installation activities who have substantially eroded their products coverage are presenting new asbestos claims as non-products operations claims or attempting to reclassify previously settled products claims as non-products claims to restore a portion of previously exhausted products aggregate limits. AFG, along with other insurers, is and will be subject to such non-products claims. It is difficult to predict whether insureds will be successful in asserting claims under non-products coverage or whether AFG and other insurers will be successful in asserting additional defenses. Therefore, the future impact of such efforts is uncertain.\nApproximately 41% of AFG\u2019s net asbestos reserves relate to policies written directly by AFG subsidiaries. Claims from these policies generally are product-oriented claims with only a limited amount of non-products exposures, and are dominated by small to mid-sized commercial entities that are mostly regional policyholders with few national target defendants. The remainder is assumed reinsurance business that includes exposures for the periods 1954 to 1983. The asbestos and environmental assumed claims are ceded by various insurance companies under reinsurance treaties. A majority of the individual assumed claims have exposures of less than $100,000 to AFG. Asbestos losses assumed include some of the industry known manufacturers, distributors and installers. Pollution losses include industry known insured names and sites.\nEstablishing reserves for A&E claims relating to policies and participations in reinsurance treaties and former operations is subject to uncertainties that are significantly greater than those presented by other types of claims. For this group of claims, traditional actuarial techniques that rely on historical loss development trends cannot be used and a range of reasonably possible losses cannot be estimated. Case reserves and expense reserves are established by the claims department as specific policies are identified. In addition to the case reserves established for known claims, management establishes additional reserves for claims not yet known or reported and for possible development on known claims. These additional reserves are management\u2019s best estimate based on periodic comprehensive studies and internal reviews adjusted for payments and identifiable changes, supplemented by management\u2019s review of industry information about such claims, with due consideration to individual claim situations.\nManagement believes that estimating the ultimate liability for asbestos claims presents a unique and difficult challenge to the insurance industry due to, among other things, inconsistent court decisions, an increase in bankruptcy filings as a result of asbestos-related liabilities, novel theories of coverage, and judicial interpretations that often expand theories of recovery and broaden the scope of coverage. The casualty insurance industry is engaged in extensive litigation over these coverage and liability issues as the volume and severity of claims against asbestos defendants continue to increase. Environmental claims likewise present challenges in prediction, due to uncertainty regarding the interpretation of insurance policies, complexities regarding multi-party involvements at sites, evolving cleanup standards and protracted time periods required to assess the level of cleanup required at contaminated sites.\n40\nTable of Contents\nThe following factors could impact AFG\u2019s reserves and payments.\n\u2022\nThere is a growing interest at the state level to attempt to legislatively address asbestos liabilities and the manner in which asbestos claims are resolved. These developments are fluid and could result in piecemeal state-by-state solutions.\n\u2022\nThe manner by which bankruptcy courts are addressing asbestos liabilities is in flux.\n\u2022\nAFG\u2019s insureds may make claims alleging significant non-products exposures.\nWhile management believes that AFG\u2019s reserves for A&E claims are a reasonable estimate of ultimate liability for such claims, actual results may vary materially from the amounts currently recorded due to the difficulty in predicting the number of future claims, the impact of recent bankruptcy filings, and unresolved issues such as whether coverage exists, whether policies are subject to aggregate limits on coverage, how claims are to be allocated among triggered policies and implicated years, and whether claimants who exhibit no signs of illness will be successful in pursuing their claims. A 1% variation in loss cost trends, caused by any of the factors previously described, would change net income by approximately $20 million.\nAFG tracks its A&E claims by policyholder. The following table shows, by type of claim, the number of policyholders that did not receive any payments in the calendar year separate from policyholders that did receive a payment. Policyholder counts represent policies written by AFG subsidiaries and do not include assumed reinsurance.\n2016\n2015\n2014\nNumber of policyholders with no indemnity payments.\nAsbestos\n87\n122\n136\nEnvironmental\n107\n112\n99\n194\n234\n235\nNumber of policyholders with indemnity payments.\nAsbestos\n66\n50\n45\nEnvironmental\n28\n25\n30\n94\n75\n75\nTotal\n288\n309\n310\nAmounts paid (net of reinsurance recoveries) for asbestos and environmental claims, including loss adjustment expenses, were as follows (in millions).\n2016\n2015\n2014\nAsbestos\n$12\n$16\n$18\nEnvironmental\n14\n13\n18\nTotal\n$26\n$29\n$36\nThe survival ratio is a measure often used by industry analysts to compare A&E reserves strength among companies. This ratio is typically calculated by dividing reserves for A&E exposures by the three-year average of paid losses, and therefore measures the number of years that it would take to pay off current reserves based on recent average payments. Because this ratio can be significantly impacted by a number of factors such as loss payout variability, caution should be exercised in attempting to determine reserve adequacy based simply on the survival ratio. At\nDecember 31, 2016\n, the property and casualty insurance segment\u2019s three-year survival ratios compare favorably with industry survival ratios published by A.M. Best (as of December 31, 2015) as detailed in the following table.\nProperty and Casualty Insurance Reserves\nThree-Year Survival Ratio (% Times Paid Losses)\nAsbestos\nEnvironmental\nTotal A&E\nAFG (12\/31\/2016)\n13.1\n9.3\n11.2\nIndustry (12\/31\/2015)\n7.7\n6.8\n7.5\nAFG has periodically conducted comprehensive external studies of its asbestos and environmental exposures relating to the run-off operations of its property and casualty insurance segment and exposures related to its former railroad and manufacturing operations with the aid of specialty actuarial, engineering and consulting firms and outside counsel, generally every two years, with an in-depth internal review during the intervening years.\nAn in-depth internal review of AFG\u2019s A&E reserves was completed in the third quarter of 2016 by AFG\u2019s internal A&E claims specialists and actuaries in consultation with specialty outside counsel and an outside consultant. As a result of the review, AFG\u2019s property and casualty insurance segment recorded a $36 million pretax special charge to increase its asbestos reserves by\n41\nTable of Contents\n$5 million (net of reinsurance) and its environmental reserves by $31 million (net of reinsurance). Over the past few years, the focus of AFG\u2019s asbestos claims litigation has shifted to smaller companies and companies with ancillary exposures. AFG\u2019s insureds with these exposures have been the driver of the property and casualty insurance segment\u2019s asbestos reserve increases in recent years. AFG is seeing modestly increasing estimates for indemnity and defense compared to prior studies. Overall, the rate of new asbestos cases received is down modestly. The increase in property and casualty environmental reserves was primarily associated with updated estimates of site investigation costs with respect to existing sites and newly identified sites. AFG is seeing increased legal defense costs in environmental claims generally, as well as a number of claims and sites where the estimated investigation and remediation costs have increased. As in past years, there were no new or emerging broad industry trends that were identified in the review.\nAs a result of the comprehensive external study completed in the third quarter of 2015, AFG\u2019s property and casualty insurance segment recorded a $67 million pretax special charge to increase its asbestos reserves by $25 million (net of reinsurance) and its environmental reserves by $42 million (net of reinsurance). The increase in property and casualty asbestos reserves was attributed to increased estimates for indemnity and defense costs. The increase in property and casualty environmental reserves was attributed primarily to increased defense costs and a number of claims where the estimated costs of remediation have increased.\nAs a result of the in-depth internal review completed in the third quarter of 2014, AFG\u2019s property and casualty insurance segment recorded a $24 million pretax special charge to increase its asbestos reserves by $4 million (net of reinsurance) and its environmental reserves by $20 million (net of reinsurance). The increase in property and casualty environmental reserves was attributed primarily to AFG\u2019s increased defense costs and a number of claims where the estimated costs of remediation have increased.\nContingencies related to Subsidiaries\u2019 Former Operations\nThe A&E studies and reviews discussed above encompassed reserves for various environmental and occupational injury and disease claims and other contingencies arising out of the railroad operations disposed of by American Premier\u2019s predecessor and certain manufacturing operations disposed of by American Premier and its subsidiaries and by Great American Financial Resources, Inc. Charges resulting from the A&E study and reviews were $5 million in\n2016\n, $12 million in\n2015\nand $6 million in\n2014\n. For a discussion of the charges recorded for those operations, see\n\u201c\nHolding Company, Other and Unallocated \u2014 Results of Operations\n.\u201d\nLiabilities for claims and contingencies arising from these former railroad and manufacturing operations totaled $86 million at\nDecember 31, 2016\n. For a discussion of the uncertainties in determining the ultimate liability, see\nNote\nM\n\u2014 \u201c\nContingencies\n\u201d\nto the financial statements.\nRun-off Long-term Care Insurance\nIn December 2015, AFG completed the sale of United Teacher Associates Insurance Company and Continental General Insurance Company, the legal entities containing substantially all of its run-off long-term care insurance business, to HC2 Holdings, Inc. (\u201cHC2\u201d) for approximately $13 million in net proceeds. AFG may also receive up to $13 million of additional proceeds from HC2 in the future contingent upon the release of certain statutory-basis liabilities of the legal entities sold by AFG. In connection with obtaining regulatory approval for the transaction, AFG agreed to provide up to an aggregate of $35 million of capital support for the insurance companies, on an as-needed basis to maintain specified surplus levels, subject to immediate reimbursement by HC2 through a five-year capital maintenance agreement. With the completion of this sale, AFG divested substantially all of its long-term care business (96% as measured by net statutory reserves as of November 30, 2015) and retained only a small block of long-term care insurance (1,600 policies) with approximately $37 million of reserves at December 31, 2016. AFG will continue to service and accept renewal premiums on its remaining outstanding policies, which are guaranteed renewable.\nMANAGED INVESTMENT ENTITIES\nAccounting standards require AFG to consolidate its investments in collateralized loan obligation (\u201cCLO\u201d) entities that it manages and owns an interest in (in the form of debt). See\nNote\nA\n\u2014\n\u201c\nAccounting Policies\n\u2014\nManaged Investment Entities\n\u201d\nand\nNote\nH\n\u2014 \u201c\nManaged Investment Entities\n\u201d\nto the financial statements.

earnings attributable to shareholders, determined in accordance with GAAP, include certain items that may not be indicative of its ongoing core operations. For example, core net operating earnings excludes realized gains (losses) on securities because such gains and losses are influenced significantly by financial markets, interest rates and the timing of sales. Similarly, significant gains and losses from the sale of real estate are excluded from core earnings as they are influenced by the timing of sales and realized gains (losses) and significant tax benefits (charges) related to subsidiaries are excluded because such gains and losses are largely the result of the changing business strategy and market opportunities.

Underwriting profitability is measured by the combined ratio, which is a sum of the ratios of losses and loss adjustment expenses, and commissions and other underwriting expenses to premiums. A combined ratio under 100% indicates an underwriting profit. The combined ratio does not reflect net investment income, other income, other expenses or federal income taxes.\nAFG\u2019s property and casualty insurance operations contributed\n$182 million\nin GAAP pretax earnings in the\nfourth\nquarter of\n2016\ncompared to\n$179 million\nin the\nfourth\nquarter of\n2015\n,\nan increase\nof\n$3 million\n(\n2%\n). Property and casualty core pretax earnings were\n$182 million\nin the\nfourth\nquarter of\n2016\ncompared to\n$164 million\nin the\nfourth\nquarter of\n2015\n,\nan increase\nof\n50\nTable of Contents\n$18 million\n(\n11%\n). The increase in GAAP and core pretax earnings reflects higher underwriting profit in the Property and transportation and Specialty financial insurance sub-segments and higher net investment income, partially offset by lower underwriting profit in the Specialty casualty sub-segment. GAAP earnings also includes a $15 million pretax gain on the sale of an apartment property in the fourth quarter of 2015.\nThe following table details AFG\u2019s GAAP and core earnings before income taxes from its property and casualty insurance operations for the three months ended\nDecember 31, 2016\nand\n2015\n(dollars in millions).\nThree months ended December 31,\n2016\n2015% Change\nGross written premiums\n$1,441\n$1,356\n6%\nReinsurance premiums ceded\n(358\n)\n(300\n)\n19%\nNet written premiums\n1,083\n1,056\n3%\nChange in unearned premiums\n61\n64\n(5%)\nNet earned premiums\n1,144\n1,120\n2%\nLoss and loss adjustment expenses\n729\n693\n5%\nCommissions and other underwriting expenses\n305\n327\n(7%)\nUnderwriting gain\n110\n100\n10%\nNet investment income\n85\n74\n15%\nOther income and expenses, net (*)\n(13\n)\n(10\n)\n30%\nCore earnings before income taxes\n182\n164\n11%\nPretax non-core gain on sale of apartment property\n\u2014\n15\n(100%)\nGAAP earnings before income taxes\n$182\n$179\n2%\n(*)   Excludes the $15 million pretax non-core gain on the sale of an apartment property in the fourth quarter of 2015.\nCombined Ratios.\nSpecialty lines\nChange\nLoss and LAE ratio\n63.7%\n61.8%\n1.9%\nUnderwriting expense ratio\n26.7%\n29.2%\n(2.5%)\nCombined ratio\n90.4%\n91.0%\n(0.6%)\nAggregate \u2014 including exited lines\nLoss and LAE ratio\n63.7%\n61.8%\n1.9%\nUnderwriting expense ratio\n26.7%\n29.2%\n(2.5%)\nCombined ratio\n90.4%\n91.0%\n(0.6%)\nAFG\u2019s combined ratio has been better than the industry average for 29 of the last 31 years. Management believes that AFG\u2019s insurance operations have performed better than the industry as a result of its specialty niche focus, product line diversification, stringent underwriting discipline and alignment of compensation incentives.\nAFG reports the underwriting performance of its Specialty property and casualty insurance business in the following sub-segments: (i) Property and transportation, (ii) Specialty casualty and (iii) Specialty financial.\nTo understand the overall profitability of particular lines, the timing of claims payments and the related impact of investment income must be considered. Certain \u201cshort-tail\u201d lines of business (primarily property coverages) generally have quick loss payouts, which reduce the time funds are held, thereby limiting investment income earned thereon. In contrast, \u201clong-tail\u201d lines of business (primarily liability coverages and workers\u2019 compensation) generally have payouts that are either structured over many years or take many years to settle, thereby significantly increasing investment income earned on related premiums received.\n51\nTable of Contents\nGross Written Premiums\nGross written premiums (\u201cGWP\u201d) for AFG\u2019s property and casualty insurance segment were\n$1.44 billion\nfor the\nfourth\nquarter of\n2016\ncompared to\n$1.36 billion\nfor the\nfourth\nquarter of\n2015\n,\nan increase\nof\n$85 million\n(\n6%\n).

Performance measures such as net interest spread and net spread earned are often presented by annuity businesses to help users of their financial statements better understand the company\u2019s performance.\nNet Spread on Fixed Annuities (excludes variable annuity earnings)\nThe table below (dollars in millions) details the components of these spreads for AFG\u2019s fixed annuity operations (including fixed-indexed annuities).\nThree months ended December 31,\n2016\n2015% Change\nAverage fixed annuity investments (at amortized cost)\n$29,192\n$26,401\n11%\nAverage fixed annuity benefits accumulated\n29,250\n26,048\n12%\nAs % of fixed annuity benefits accumulated (except as noted).\nNet investment income (as % of fixed annuity investments)\n4.72%\n4.65%\nInterest credited \u2014 fixed\n(2.02%)\n(2.12%)\nNet interest spread\n2.70%\n2.53%\nPolicy charges and other miscellaneous income\n0.15%\n0.15%\nOther annuity benefit expenses, net of guaranteed withdrawal benefit fees\n(0.38%)\n(0.31%)\nAcquisition expenses\n(1.06%)\n(0.75%)\nOther expenses\n(0.35%)\n(0.32%)\nChange in fair value of derivatives related to fixed-indexed annuities\n0.73%\n0.02%\nUnlocking\n0.03%\n0.07%\nNet spread earned on fixed annuities\n1.82%\n1.39%\n60\nTable of Contents\nThe table below illustrates the impact of fair value accounting for derivatives related to fixed-indexed annuities on the annuity segment\u2019s net spread earned on fixed annuities.\nThree months ended December 31,\n2016\n2015\nNet spread earned on fixed annuities \u2014 before impact of derivatives related to FIAs\n1.42%\n1.31%\nImpact of derivatives related to fixed-indexed annuities.\nChange in fair value of derivatives\n0.73%\n0.02%\nRelated impact on amortization of DPAC (*)\n(0.31%)\n0.06%\nRelated impact on amortization of deferred sales inducements (*)\n(0.02%)\n\u2014%\nNet spread earned on fixed annuities\n1.82%\n1.39%\n(*)\nAn estimate of the related acceleration\/deceleration of the amortization of deferred policy acquisition costs and deferred sales inducements.\nAnnuity Net Investment Income\nNet investment income for the\nfourth\nquarter of\n2016\nwas\n$346 million\ncompared to\n$309 million\nfor the\nfourth\nquarter of\n2015\n,\nan increas\ne\nof\n$37 million\n(\n12%\n). This\nincrease\nreflects primarily the growth in AFG\u2019s annuity business and higher income from certain investments that are required to be carried at fair value through earnings, partially offset by the impact of lower investment yields. The overall yield earned on investments in AFG\u2019s fixed annuity operations, calculated as net investment income divided by average investment balances (at amortized cost),\nincreased\nby\n0.07\npercentage points to\n4.72%\nfrom\n4.65%\nin the\nfourth\nquarter of\n2016\ncompared to the\nfourth\nquarter of\n2015\n. This\nincrease\nin net investment yield reflects higher income from certain investments that are required to be carried at fair value through earnings, partially offset by (i) the investment of new premium dollars at lower yields as compared to the existing investment portfolio and (ii) the impact of the reinvestment of proceeds from maturity and redemption of higher yielding investments at the lower yields available in the financial markets. During 2016, $4.0 billion in annuity segment investments with an average yield of 5.51% were redeemed or sold while the investments purchased during 2016 (with new premium dollars and the redemption\/sale proceeds) had an average yield at purchase of 4.21%.\nAnnuity Interest Credited \u2014 Fixed\nInterest credited \u2014 fixed for the\nfourth\nquarter of\n2016\nwas\n$148 million\ncompared to\n$138 million\nfor the\nfourth\nquarter of\n2015\n,\nan increase\nof\n$10 million\n(\n7%\n). The impact of growth in the annuity business was partially offset by lower interest crediting rates on new premiums as compared to the crediting rates on policyholder funds surrendered or withdrawn.

Features included in current annuity product offerings allow AFG to achieve its desired profitability at a lower net interest spread than historical product offerings. As a result, AFG expects its net interest spread to narrow in the future.\nAnnuity Policy Charges and Other Miscellaneous Income\nAnnuity policy charges and other miscellaneous income, which consist primarily of surrender charges, amortization of deferred upfront policy charges (unearned revenue) and income from sales of real estate were\n$13 million\nin the\nfourth\nquarter of\n2016\ncompared to\n$11 million\nin the\nfourth\nquarter of\n2015\n,\nan increase\nof\n$2 million\n(\n18%\n).

In addition to interest credited to policyholders\u2019 accounts and the change in fair value of derivatives related to fixed-indexed annuities, annuity benefits expense also includes the following expenses (in millions, net of guaranteed withdrawal benefit fees).\nThree months ended December 31,\n2016\n2015\nChange in expected death and annuitization reserve\n$4\n$5\nAmortization of sales inducements\n7\n6\nChange in guaranteed withdrawal benefit reserve\n20\n15\nChange in other benefit reserves\n11\n5\nOther annuity benefits\n42\n31\nOffset guaranteed withdrawal benefit fees\n(14\n)\n(12\n)\nOther annuity benefits, net\n$28\n$19\nAs discussed under\n\u201cAnnuity Benefits Accumulated\u201d\nin\nNote\nA\n\u2014 \u201c\nAccounting Policies\n\u201d\nto the financial statements, guaranteed withdrawal benefit reserves are accrued for and modified using assumptions similar to those used in establishing and amortizing deferred policy acquisition costs. The guaranteed withdrawal benefit reserve related to FIAs can be inversely impacted by the calculated FIA embedded derivative reserve as the value to policyholders of the guaranteed withdrawal benefits decreases when the benefit of stock market participation increases.\nAnnuity Acquisition Expenses\nExcluding the impact of unlocking charges (expense reductions) discussed under\n\u201c\nAnnuity Unlocking\n\u201d\nbelow, AFG\u2019s amortization of DPAC and commission expenses as a percentage of average fixed annuity benefits accumulated was\n1.06%\nfor the\nfourth\nquarter of\n2016\ncompared to\n0.75%\nfor the\nfourth\nquarter of\n2015\nand has generally ranged between 0.75% and 0.85%. Variances from the general range relate primarily to the impact of (i) material changes in interest rates or the stock market on AFG\u2019s fixed-indexed annuity business, and (ii) differences in actual experience from actuarially projected estimates and assumptions. For example, the positive impact of the significantly higher than anticipated interest rates and strong stock market performance during the\nfourth\nquarter of\n2016\non the fair value of derivatives related to fixed-indexed annuities (discussed below) resulted in a partially offsetting acceleration in the amortization of DPAC. During the third quarter of 2015, the deceleration in the amortization of DPAC caused by the negative impact of poor stock market performance on the fair value accounting for derivatives related to fixed-indexed annuities was limited on certain recently issued products. This prior period limitation had a $5 million favorable impact on the amortization of DPAC related to the fair value accounting for those derivatives when the stock market rebounded during the fourth quarter of 2015. This favorable impact is reported in the impact on DPAC of derivatives related to FIAs.\nThe table below illustrates the estimated impact of fair value accounting for derivatives related to fixed-indexed annuities on annuity acquisition expenses as a percentage of average fixed annuity benefits accumulated.\nThree months ended December 31,\n2016\n2015\nBefore the impact of changes in the fair value of derivatives related to fixed-indexed annuities on the amortization of DPAC\n0.75%\n0.81%\nImpact of changes in fair value of derivatives related to FIAs on the amortization of DPAC (*)\n0.31%\n(0.06%)\nAnnuity acquisition expenses as a % of fixed annuity benefits accumulated\n1.06%\n0.75%\n(*)\nAn estimate of the acceleration\/deceleration in the amortization of deferred policy acquisition costs resulting from fair value accounting for derivatives related to fixed-indexed annuities.\nAnnuity Other Expenses\nAnnuity other expenses were\n$27 million\nfor the\nfourth\nquarter of\n2016\ncompared to\n$22 million\nfor the\nfourth\nquarter of\n2015\n,\nan increase\nof\n$5 million\n(\n23%\n). Annuity other expenses represent primarily general and administrative expenses, as well as selling and issuance expenses that are not deferred. The increase in annuity other expenses reflects primarily growth in the business and an increase in the number of sales personnel focused on new initiatives and increased market share within existing financial institutions and retail marketing organizations in the\nfourth\nquarter of\n2016\ncompared to the\nfourth\nquarter of\n2015\n. As\n62\nTable of Contents\na percentage of average fixed annuity benefits accumulated, these expenses\nincreased\n0.03\npercentage points to\n0.35%\nfrom\n0.32%\nfor the\nfourth\nquarter of\n2016\nas compared to the\nfourth\nquarter of\n2015.\nChange in Fair Value of Derivatives Related to Fixed-Indexed Annuities\nAFG\u2019s fixed-indexed annuities provide policyholders with a crediting rate tied, in part, to the performance of an existing stock market index. AFG attempts to mitigate the risk in the index-based component of these products through the purchase of call options on the appropriate index. AFG\u2019s strategy is designed so that the change in the fair value of the call option assets will generally offset the economic change in the liabilities from the index participation. Both the index-based component of the annuities and the related call options are considered derivatives that must be adjusted for changes in fair value through earnings each period. The fair values of these derivatives are impacted by actual and expected stock market performance and interest rates as well as other factors. For a list of other factors impacting the fair value of the index-based component of AFG\u2019s annuity benefits accumulated, see\nNote\nD\n\u2014 \u201c\nFair Value Measurements\n\u201d\nto the financial statements. Excluding the impact of unlocking charges, the net change in fair value of derivatives related to fixed-indexed annuities\ndecreased\nannuity benefits by\n$54 million\nin the\nfourth\nquarter of\n2016\nand had a nominal impact on annuity benefits in the\nfourth\nquarter of\n2015\n. The\n$54 million\ndecrease in annuity benefits in the fourth quarter of 2016 reflects the positive impact of significantly higher than anticipated interest rates and strong market performance on the fair value of these derivatives. As a percentage of average fixed annuity benefits accumulated, this net expense reduction increased\n0.71\npercentage points to\n0.73%\nin the\nfourth\nquarter of\n2016\nfrom\n0.02%\nin the\nfourth\nquarter of\n2015.\nFluctuations in interest rates and the stock market, among other factors, can cause volatility in the periodic measurement of fair value of the embedded derivative that management believes can be inconsistent with the long-term economics of these products. The table below illustrates the impact of fair value accounting for derivatives related to fixed-indexed annuities on the annuity segment\u2019s earnings before income taxes (dollars in millions).\nThree months ended December 31,\n2016\n2015% Change\nEarnings before income taxes \u2014 before change in fair value of derivatives related to fixed-indexed annuities\n$103\n$96\n7%\nChange in fair value of derivatives related to fixed-indexed annuities\n54\n\u2014\n\u2014%\nRelated impact on amortization of DPAC (*)\n(25\n)\n5\n(600%)\nEarnings before income taxes\n$132\n$101\n31%\n(*)\nAn estimate of the related acceleration\/deceleration of amortization of deferred sales inducements and deferred policy acquisition costs.\nAs illustrated in the table above, the change in fair value of derivatives related to fixed-indexed annuities, including the related impact on amortization of DPAC, increased the annuity segment\u2019s earnings before income taxes by\n$29 million\nin the\nfourth\nquarter of\n2016\nand by\n$5 million\nin the\nfourth\nquarter of\n2015.\nSee\n\u201c\nAnnuity Unlocking\n\u201d\nbelow for a discussion of the impact that the periodic review of actuarial assumptions had on annuity and supplemental insurance acquisition expenses. Unanticipated spread compression, decreases in the stock market, adverse mortality experience, and higher than expected lapse rates could lead to future write-offs of DPAC or the present value of future profits on business in force of companies acquired (\u201cPVFP\u201d).\nAnnuity Net Spread Earned on Fixed Annuities\nAFG\u2019s net spread earned on fixed annuities\nincreased\n0.43\npercentage points to\n1.82%\nfrom\n1.39%\nin the\nfourth\nquarter of\n2016\ncompared to the same period in\n2015\ndue primarily to the net impact of changes in the fair value of derivatives and related DPAC amortization offset discussed above and the\n0.17\npercentage points\nincrease\nin AFG\u2019s net interest spread.\n63\nTable of Contents\nAnnuity Benefits Accumulated\nAnnuity premiums received and benefit payments are recorded as increases or decreases in annuity benefits accumulated rather than as revenue and expense. Increases in this liability for interest credited and other benefits are charged to expense and decreases for surrender and other policy charges are credited to other income.\nFor certain products, annuity benefits accumulated also includes reserves for accrued persistency and premium bonuses, excess benefits expected to be paid on future deaths and annuitizations (\u201cEDAR\u201d) and guaranteed withdrawal benefits. Annuity benefits accumulated also includes amounts advanced from the Federal Home Loan Bank of Cincinnati.

There is considerable discussion surrounding the possibility of a delay or other action impacting the rule. On February 9, 2017, the DOL filed a notice with the Office of Management and Budget to delay implementation of the regulation. However, until there is some definitive action impacting the rule, AFG intends to continue to pursue necessary changes.\nAssuming the rule becomes effective in its current form, AFG believes the biggest impact will be on insurance-only licensed agents whose sales represented less than 10% of its fourth quarter annuity premium. While AFG\u2019s management continues to believe the adjustments required of AFG and its distribution partners to comply with the rule will impact 2017 annuity premiums, management does not believe the new rule will have a material impact on AFG\u2019s results of operations.\n64\nTable of Contents\nAnnuity Unlocking\nIn the fourth quarters of\n2016\nand\n2015\n, AFG conducted a detailed review (\u201cunlocking\u201d) of the major actuarial assumptions underlying its annuity operations. As a result of these reviews, AFG recorded net expense reductions related to its annuity business of\n$1 million\nin\n2016\nand\n$10 million\nin\n2015\n, which impacted AFG\u2019s financial statements as follows (in millions).\nThree months ended December 31,\n2016\n2015\nPolicy charges and other miscellaneous income.\nUnearned revenue\n$(1\n)\n$(2\n)\nTotal revenues\n(1\n)\n(2\n)\nAnnuity benefits.\nFixed-indexed annuity embedded derivative\n17\n28\nSales inducements\n(4\n)\n(4\n)\nOther reserves\n10\n(5\n)\nTotal annuity benefits\n23\n19\nAnnuity and supplemental insurance acquisition expenses.\nDeferred policy acquisition costs\n(25\n)\n(31\n)\nTotal costs and expenses\n(2\n)\n(12\n)\nNet expense reduction\n$1\n$10\nThe net expense reduction from unlocking annuity assumptions in the fourth quarter of 2016 reflects the favorable impact of an increase in projected net interest spreads on in-force business, substantially offset by the unfavorable impact of (i) changes in projected policyholder annuitization and lapse behavior, (ii) an increase in the risk premium for the uncertainty in the cash flows component of the discount rates used to value the FIA-related embedded derivative and (iii) a slight decrease in projected stock market growth over the next three years. Reinvestment rate assumptions are based primarily on 7-year and 10-year corporate bond yields. For the 2016 unlocking, AFG assumed a net reinvestment rate (net of default and expense assumptions) of 4.24% in 2017, grading up ratably to an ultimate net reinvestment rate of 5.55% in 2022 and beyond.\nThe table below compares the reinvestment rate assumed in AFG\u2019s fourth quarter unlockings for the next calendar year to the actual reinvestment rate achieved in that period (both net of investment expenses).\nFirst\nUnlocking\nInvestment\nReinvestment Rate\nYear\nPeriod\nAssumed (*)\nAchieved\n2014\n2015\n3.75%\n4.27%\n2015\n2016\n4.05%\n4.27%\n2016\n2017\n4.42%\nn\/a\n(*)\nAssumed reinvestment rates exclude default rates of 0.18% in each period.\nManagement believes that these results demonstrate that AFG\u2019s reinvestment rate assumptions are reasonable and prudently conservative. In addition to the reinvestment rates above, actual default rates in 2015 and 2016 were lower than the long-term default rates of 0.18% assumed in the unlocking in each of the periods above.\nThe 2015 net expense reduction was due primarily to the impact of changes in assumptions to reflect higher than previously projected net interest spreads as well as the impact of higher assets under management and expense discipline. For the 2015 unlocking, AFG assumed a net reinvestment rate (net of default and expense assumptions) of 3.87% in 2016, grading up ratably to an ultimate net reinvestment rate of 5.53% in 2022 and beyond.\n65\nTable of Contents\nAnnuity Earnings before Income Taxes Reconciliation\nThe following table reconciles the net spread earned on AFG\u2019s fixed annuities to overall annuity pretax earnings for the three months ended\nDecember 31, 2016\nand\n2015\n(in millions).\nThree months ended December 31,\n2016\n2015\nEarnings on fixed annuity benefits accumulated\n$133\n$91\nEarnings on investments in excess of fixed annuity benefits accumulated (*)\n\u2014\n4\nVariable annuity earnings (loss)\n(1\n)\n6\nEarnings before income taxes\n$132\n$101\n(*)\nNet investment income (as a % of investments) of\n4.72%\nand\n4.65%\nfor the three months ended\nDecember 31, 2016\nand\n2015\n, respectively, multiplied by the difference between average fixed annuity investments (at amortized cost) and average fixed annuity benefits accumulated in each period.\nRun-off Long-Term Care and Life Segment \u2014 Results of Operations\nAFG\u2019s run-off long-term care and life segment reported GAAP pretax earnings of $2 million for the\nfourth\nquarter of\n2016\ncompared to a loss of\n$4 million\nfor the\nfourth\nquarter of\n2015\n.

In addition, certain of AFG\u2019s property and casualty businesses collect fees from customers for ancillary services such as workplace safety programs and premium financing. In the\nfourth\nquarter of\n2016\n, AFG collected\n$17 million\nin fees for these services compared to\n$16 million\nin the\nfourth\nquarter of\n2015\n. Management views this fee income, net of the\n$11 million\nin the\nfourth\nquarter of\n2016\nand\n$10 million\nin the\nfourth\nquarter of\n2015\n, in expenses incurred to generate such fees, as a reduction in the cost of underwriting its property and casualty insurance policies. Consistent with internal management reporting, these fees and the related expenses are netted and recorded as a reduction of commissions and other underwriting expenses in AFG\u2019s segmented results.\nHolding Company and Other \u2014 Other Income\nOther income in the table above includes\n$5 million\nand\n$4 million\nin the\nfourth\nquarter of\n2016\nand\n2015\n, respectively, in management fees paid to AFG by the AFG-managed CLOs (AFG\u2019s consolidated managed investment entities). The management fees are eliminated in consolidation \u2014 see the other income line in the Consolidate MIEs column under\n\u201cResults of Operations \u2014\nSegmented Statement of Earnings.\n\u201d\nExcluding amounts eliminated in consolidation, AFG recorded other income outside of its insurance operations of $3 million in the\nfourth\nquarter of\n2016\nand $2 million in the\nfourth\nquarter of\n2015.\n67\nTable of Contents\nHolding Company and Other \u2014 Interest Charges on Borrowed Money\nAFG\u2019s holding companies and other operations outside of its insurance operations recorded interest expense of\n$21 million\nin the\nfourth\nquarter of\n2016\ncompared to\n$16 million\nin the\nfourth\nquarter of\n2015\n,\nan increase\nof\n$5 million\n(\n31%\n).

This transaction allowed National Interstate and its subsidiaries to become members of the AFG consolidated tax group, which resulted in a tax benefit of $66 million to AFG during the fourth quarter of 2016.\nIn connection with the ongoing reorganization of AFG\u2019s Neon Lloyd\u2019s business, in December 2016, AFG undertook a restructuring that included the liquidation for tax purposes of the foreign subsidiary that is the parent of the Neon Lloyd\u2019s operations, resulting in a taxable loss for U.S. tax purposes. AFG reported the $111 million tax benefit associated with this loss in the fourth quarter of 2016.

The increase in GAAP and core pretax earnings reflects improved underwriting results in the Property and transportation group and higher net investment income, partially offset by lower underwriting profit in the Specialty casualty and Specialty financial groups. GAAP pretax earnings also reflect a pretax non-core charge of $65 million in the second quarter of 2016 related to the exit of certain lines of business within Neon and a $32 million pretax non-core gain on the sale of an apartment property in the second quarter of 2016 compared to a $51 million pretax non-core gain on the sale of a hotel in the second quarter of 2015 and a $15 million pretax non-core gain on the sale of an apartment property in the fourth quarter of 2015, as well as non-core special A&E charges of $36 million in 2016 compared to $67 million in 2015.\nAFG\u2019s property and casualty insurance operations contributed $576 million in GAAP pretax earnings in 2015 compared to $456 million in 2014, an increase of $120 million (26%). Property and casualty core pretax earnings were $577 million in 2015\n72\nTable of Contents\ncompared to $480 million in 2014, an increase of $97 million (20%). The increase in GAAP and core pretax earnings reflects higher underwriting profit across each of AFG\u2019s property and casualty insurance sub-segments, higher net investment income (due primarily to the investment of cash acquired in the Summit acquisition on April 1, 2014) and lower net expenses. The increase in GAAP pretax earnings in 2015 also reflects pretax non-core gains of $51 million on the sale of a hotel and $15 million on the sale of an apartment property, partially offset by higher non-core special A&E charges in 2015 as compared to 2014.\nThe following table details AFG\u2019s GAAP and core earnings before income taxes from its property and casualty insurance operations for the\nyears ended December 31, 2016\n,\n2015\nand\n2014\n(dollars in millions).\nYear ended December 31,% Change\n2016\n2015\n2014\n2016 - 2015\n2015 - 2014\nGross written premiums\n$5,981\n$5,832\n$5,477\n3%\n6%\nReinsurance premiums ceded\n(1,595\n)\n(1,505\n)\n(1,457\n)\n6%\n3%\nNet written premiums\n4,386\n4,327\n4,020\n1%\n8%\nChange in unearned premiums\n(58\n)\n(103\n)\n(142\n)\n(44%)\n(27%)\nNet earned premiums\n4,328\n4,224\n3,878\n2%\n9%\nLoss and loss adjustment expenses (a)\n2,669\n2,628\n2,470\n2%\n6%\nCommissions and other underwriting expenses (b)\n1,322\n1,304\n1,172\n1%\n11%\nCore underwriting gain\n337\n292\n236\n15%\n24%\nNet investment income\n350\n319\n294\n10%\n9%\nOther income and expenses, net (c)\n(41\n)\n(34\n)\n(50\n)\n21%\n(32%)\nCore earnings before income taxes\n646\n577\n480\n12%\n20%\nPretax non-core special A&E charges\n(36\n)\n(67\n)\n(24\n)\n(46%)\n179%\nPretax non-core Neon exited lines charge\n(65\n)\n\u2014\n\u2014\n\u2014%\n\u2014%\nPretax non-core gain on sale of apartment properties and hotel\n32\n66\n\u2014\n(52%)\n\u2014%\nGAAP earnings before income taxes\n$577\n$576\n$456\n\u2014%\n26%\n(a)   Excludes pretax non-core special A&E charges of $36 million, $67 million and $24 million in 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively, and a non-core charge of $57 million related to the exit of certain lines of business within Neon in 2016.\n(b)   Excludes a non-core charge of $8 million related to the exit of certain lines of business within Neon in 2016.\n(c)   Excludes pretax non-core gains of $32 million on the sale of an apartment property in 2016 and $51 million on the sale of a hotel and $15 million on the sale of an apartment property in 2015.\nChange\n2016 - 2015\n2015 - 2014\nCombined Ratios.\nSpecialty lines\nLoss and LAE ratio\n61.7%\n62.2%\n63.7%\n(0.5%)\n(1.5%)\nUnderwriting expense ratio\n30.6%\n30.9%\n30.2%\n(0.3%)\n0.7%\nCombined ratio\n92.3%\n93.1%\n93.9%\n(0.8%)\n(0.8%)\nAggregate \u2014 including exited lines\nLoss and LAE ratio\n63.8%\n63.8%\n64.3%\n\u2014%\n(0.5%)\nUnderwriting expense ratio\n30.7%\n30.9%\n30.2%\n(0.2%)\n0.7%\nCombined ratio\n94.5%\n94.7%\n94.5%\n(0.2%)\n0.2%\nAFG reports the underwriting performance of its Specialty property and casualty insurance business in the following sub-segments: (i) Property and transportation, (ii) Specialty casualty and (iii) Specialty financial.\n73\nTable of Contents\nGross Written Premiums\nGross written premiums (\u201cGWP\u201d) for AFG\u2019s property and casualty insurance segment were\n$5.98 billion\nin\n2016\ncompared to\n$5.83 billion\nin\n2015\n,\nan increase\nof\n$149 million\n(\n3%\n).

Overall average renewal rates increased approximately 1% in 2015.\nProperty and transportation\nGross written premiums\nincreased\n$49 million\n(\n2%\n) in\n2016\ncompared to\n2015\n. This increase was the result of higher premiums in the agricultural businesses, growth in the transportation businesses and higher gross written premiums from the Singapore branch, which opened for business in June 2015, partially offset by lower gross written premiums in the property and inland marine businesses. Average renewal rates increased approximately 3% for this group in\n2016\n, including a 5% increase in National Interstate\u2019s renewal rates. Reinsurance premiums ceded as a percentage of gross written premiums were comparable in\n2016\nand\n2015.\nGross written premiums increased $113 million (5%) in 2015 compared to 2014. This increase is the result of higher gross written premiums in the transportation businesses due primarily to new accounts, higher gross written premiums in the agricultural businesses and new gross written premiums from the Singapore branch, which opened for business in June 2015, partially offset by lower gross written premiums in the property and inland marine businesses. Average renewal rates were up approximately 4% for this group in 2015, including a 5% increase in National Interstate\u2019s renewal rates. Reinsurance premiums ceded as a percentage of gross written premiums were comparable in 2015 and 2014.\nSpecialty casualty\nGross written premiums\nincreased\n$53 million\n(\n2%\n) in\n2016\ncompared to\n2015\n. Higher gross written premiums in the excess and surplus, targeted markets and workers\u2019 compensation businesses were partially offset by lower premiums in the general liability business and by Neon\u2019s exit of certain lines of business and implementation of more stringent underwriting standards at Neon. Lower premiums in the general liability business were primarily the result of competitive market conditions, re-underwriting efforts within the Florida homebuilders market and the slowdown within the energy sector. Average renewal rates decreased approximately 1% for this group in\n2016\n, including a decrease of approximately 4% in the workers\u2019 compensation businesses. Excluding the workers\u2019 compensation business, average renewal rates for this group increased approximately 1% during\n2016\n. Reinsurance premiums ceded as a percentage of gross written premiums increased 2 percentage points in\n2016\ncompared to\n2015\n, reflecting the cession of Neon\u2019s UK medical malpractice business and a change in the mix of business at Neon.\nGross written premiums increased $210 million (8%) in 2015 compared to 2014 reflecting $535 million in gross written premiums from Summit (acquired in April 2014) in 2015 compared to $414 million in 2014. Excluding premiums from Summit, gross written premiums increased 4% in 2015 compared to 2014. While most of the businesses in this group reported growth, the workers\u2019 compensation, excess and surplus lines and targeted markets businesses were primary drivers of the higher premiums, partially offset by lower premiums in the general liability business, primarily the result of competitive market conditions, re-underwriting efforts within the Florida homebuilders market and the slowdown within the energy sector. Average renewal rates for this group were down 1% in 2015 due primarily to lower pricing in the workers\u2019 compensation businesses. Excluding the workers\u2019 compensation business, average renewal rates in this group increased 1% during 2015. Reinsurance premiums ceded as a percentage of gross written premiums declined 1 percentage point in 2015 compared to 2014 reflecting the impact of the acquisition of Summit, which cedes only about 1% of its premiums.\nSpecialty financial\nGross written premiums\nincreased\n$48 million\n(\n8%\n) in\n2016\ncompared to\n2015\ndue primarily to growth in the financial institutions and surety businesses. Average renewal rates for this group decreased approximately 1% in\n2016\n. Reinsurance premiums ceded as a percentage of gross written premiums increased 1 percentage point in\n2016\ncompared to\n2015\n, reflecting higher cessions in the financial institutions business, partially offset by a decline in auto dealer business, which is heavily reinsured.\nGross written premiums increased $32 million (5%) in 2015 compared to 2014 due primarily to higher gross written premiums in the surety, financial institutions and equipment leasing businesses. Average renewal rates for this group were flat in 2015. Reinsurance premiums ceded as a percentage of gross written premiums decreased 4 percentage points in 2015 compared to 2014, reflecting a decline in auto dealer business, which is heavily reinsured.\nOther specialty\nThe amounts shown as reinsurance premiums ceded represent business assumed by AFG\u2019s internal reinsurance program from the operations that make up AFG\u2019s other Specialty property and casualty insurance sub-segments.\n75\nTable of Contents\nCombined Ratio\nThe table below (dollars in millions) details the components of the combined ratio for AFG\u2019s property and casualty insurance segment for\n2016\n,\n2015\nand\n2014\n.\nYear ended December 31,\nChange\nYear ended December 31,\n2016\n2015\n2014\n2016 - 2015\n2015 - 2014\n2016\n2015\n2014\nProperty and transportation\nLoss and LAE ratio\n67.0%\n72.4%\n74.9%\n(5.4%)\n(2.5%)\nUnderwriting expense ratio\n23.0%\n24.5%\n23.8%\n(1.5%)\n0.7%\nCombined ratio\n90.0%\n96.9%\n98.7%\n(6.9%)\n(1.8%)\nUnderwriting profit\n$166\n$48\n$21\nSpecialty casualty\nLoss and LAE ratio\n65.8%\n62.9%\n62.7%\n2.9%\n0.2%\nUnderwriting expense ratio\n30.3%\n29.8%\n29.6%\n0.5%\n0.2%\nCombined ratio\n96.1%\n92.7%\n92.3%\n3.4%\n0.4%\nUnderwriting profit\n$78\n$146\n$136\nSpecialty financial\nLoss and LAE ratio\n32.0%\n29.7%\n33.9%\n2.3%\n(4.2%)\nUnderwriting expense ratio\n52.9%\n53.4%\n52.6%\n(0.5%)\n0.8%\nCombined ratio\n84.9%\n83.1%\n86.5%\n1.8%\n(3.4%)\nUnderwriting profit\n$84\n$87\n$64\nTotal Specialty\nLoss and LAE ratio\n61.7%\n62.2%\n63.7%\n(0.5%)\n(1.5%)\nUnderwriting expense ratio\n30.6%\n30.9%\n30.2%\n(0.3%)\n0.7%\nCombined ratio\n92.3%\n93.1%\n93.9%\n(0.8%)\n(0.8%)\nUnderwriting profit\n$337\n$295\n$237\nAggregate \u2014 including exited lines\nLoss and LAE ratio\n63.8%\n63.8%\n64.3%\n\u2014%\n(0.5%)\nUnderwriting expense ratio\n30.7%\n30.9%\n30.2%\n(0.2%)\n0.7%\nCombined ratio\n94.5%\n94.7%\n94.5%\n(0.2%)\n0.2%\nUnderwriting profit\n$236\n$225\n$212\nThe Specialty property and casualty insurance operations generated an underwriting profit of\n$337 million\nin\n2016\ncompared to\n$295 million\nin\n2015\n,\nan increase\nof\n$42 million\n(\n14%\n). The higher underwriting profit in\n2016\nreflects higher underwriting profit in the Property and transportation sub-segment, partially offset by lower underwriting profit in the Specialty casualty and Specialty financial sub-segments. Overall catastrophe losses were $55 million (1.3 points on the combined ratio) in 2016 compared to $35 million (0.8 points on the combined ratio) in 2015.\nThe Specialty property and casualty insurance operations generated an underwriting profit of $295 million in 2015 compared to $237 million in 2014, an increase of $58 million (24%). The higher underwriting profit in 2015 reflects higher underwriting profit across each of AFG\u2019s property and casualty insurance sub-segments. Overall catastrophe losses were $35 million (0.8 points on the combined ratio) in 2015 compared to $28 million (0.7 points on the combined ratio) in 2014.\nProperty and transportation\nUnderwriting profit for this group was\n$166 million\nin\n2016\ncompared to\n$48 million\nin\n2015\n,\nan increase\nof\n$118 million\n(\n246%\n). This improvement reflects higher underwriting profit in the crop insurance business, primarily the result of favorable growing conditions and relatively stable commodity pricing and higher underwriting profits in the transportation and property and inland marine businesses. These improved results were partially offset by an increase of $10 million in catastrophe losses in 2016 compared to 2015.\nUnderwriting profit for this group was $48 million in 2015 compared to $21 million in 2014, an increase of $27 million (129%). Higher profits in the agricultural operations and improved year-over-year underwriting results at National Interstate, due primarily to lower adverse prior year reserve development, were partially offset by lower profitability in the property and inland marine, ocean marine and other transportation businesses.\n76\nTable of Contents\nSpecialty casualty\nUnderwriting profit for this group was\n$78 million\nin\n2016\ncompared to\n$146 million\nin\n2015\n,\na decrease\nof\n$68 million\n(\n47%\n). Higher underwriting profitability in the workers\u2019 compensation businesses, due primarily to higher favorable prior year reserve development, and improved results in the general liability business were more than offset by adverse prior year reserve development in the excess and surplus and targeted markets businesses, current accident year trade credit losses in Neon\u2019s political risk and trade credit business and higher catastrophe losses.\nUnderwriting profit for this group was $146 million in 2015 compared to $136 million in 2014, an increase of $10 million (7%). This increase is due primarily to higher profitability in the workers\u2019 compensation and targeted markets businesses, partially offset by higher adverse prior year reserve development at Neon and in the general liability and excess and surplus businesses and lower favorable prior year reserve development in the executive liability business.\nSpecialty financial\nUnderwriting profit for this group was\n$84 million\nin\n2016\ncompared to\n$87 million\nin\n2015\n,\na decrease\nof\n$3 million\n(\n3%\n). Higher underwriting profit in the fidelity and crime and surety businesses, primarily the result of higher favorable prior year reserve development, was more than offset by lower underwriting profit in the financial institutions and trade credit businesses, resulting primarily from lower favorable prior year reserve development.\nUnderwriting profit for this group was $87 million in 2015 compared to $64 million in 2014, an increase of $23 million (36%). This increase was driven by higher favorable prior year reserve development across the group and higher current year underwriting profitability in the fidelity and financial institutions businesses, partially offset by an increase of $6 million in catastrophe losses in 2015 compared to 2014.\nOther specialty\nUnderwriting profit for this group was\n$9 million\nin\n2016\ncompared to\n$14 million\nin\n2015\n,\na decrease\nof\n$5 million\n(\n36%\n).

As a result of Neon\u2019s claims review of its exited lines of business, AFG recorded a charge of approximately $65 million including $57 million to increase loss reserves primarily related to its medical malpractice and general liability lines. Consistent with the treatment of other items that are not indicative of AFG\u2019s ongoing operations (both favorable and unfavorable), this charge is being treated as non-core because it resulted from a special strategic review of lines of business that Neon no longer writes.\nAggregate\nAggregate net prior accident years reserve development for AFG\u2019s property and casualty insurance segment includes the A&E charges and Neon exited lines charge mentioned above and adverse reserve development of $3 million in 2015 and $1 million in 2014 related to business outside of the Specialty group that AFG no longer writes.\nCatastrophe losses\nAFG generally seeks to reduce its exposure to catastrophes through individual risk selection, including minimizing coastal and known fault-line exposures, and the purchase of reinsurance. Catastrophe losses of $55 million in\n2016\nresulted primarily from winter storms in the first quarter, storms in Texas in the second quarter, flooding in Louisiana and multiple storms in the southern United States in the third quarter and Hurricane Matthew in the fourth quarter. Catastrophe losses of\n$35 million\nin\n2015\nresulted primarily from winter storms in the first quarter, multiple storms in the midwestern and central United States in the second and third quarters and flooding in the midwestern United States in the fourth quarter.

The property and casualty insurance segment\u2019s overall yield on investments was 3.56% in 2015 compared to 3.75% in 2014, a decline of 0.19 percentage points reflecting the impact of lower yields available in the financial markets and lower earnings from other investments.\nProperty and Casualty Other Income and Expenses, Net\nGAAP other income and expenses, net for AFG\u2019s property and casualty operations was a net expense of\n$9 million\nin 2016, net income of\n$32 million\nin 2015, and a net expense of\n$50 million\nin\n2014\n.

Included in these results is the change in fair value of derivatives related to FIAs, which had a negative impact of $27 million in\n2016\ncompared to $23 million in\n2015\n. For\n2016\n, the negative impact of a significant drop in interest rates on fair value accounting for FIAs was partially offset by the positive impact of an increase in the stock market. For\n2015\n, fair value accounting for FIAs was negatively impacted by a significant decrease in the stock market and a slightly lower than expected increase in interest rates. AFG\u2019s periodic detailed review (\u201cunlocking\u201d) of the major actuarial assumptions underlying its annuity operations resulted in a net annuity expense reduction of $1 million in\n2016\ncompared to $10 million in\n2015.\nAFG\u2019s annuity operations contributed $331 million in pretax earnings in 2015 compared to $328 million in 2014, an increase of $3 million (1%). While AFG\u2019s average annuity investments (at amortized cost) were 12% higher in 2015 as compared to 2014, the benefit of this growth and the impact that fluctuations in interest rates had on the fair value accounting for FIAs was offset by the negative impact that the stock market decrease had on certain annuity reserves in 2015 compared to a stock market increase in 2014, the run-off of higher yielding investments and higher general and administrative expenses in 2015 compared to 2014.

Variances from the general range relate primarily to the impact of (i) material changes in interest rates or the stock market on AFG\u2019s fixed-indexed annuity business, and (ii) differences in actual experience from actuarially projected estimates and assumptions. For example, the negative impact of significantly lower than anticipated interest rates during\n2016\n, the significant stock market decrease in\n2015\nand slightly lower than anticipated interest rates during\n2014\non the fair value of derivatives related to fixed-indexed annuities (discussed below) resulted in a partially offsetting deceleration in the amortization of DPAC.\nThe table below illustrates the estimated impact of fair value accounting for derivatives related to fixed-indexed annuities on annuity acquisition expenses as a percentage of average fixed annuity benefits accumulated.\nYear ended December 31,\n2016\n2015\n2014\nBefore the impact of changes in the fair value of derivatives related to fixed-indexed annuities on the amortization of DPAC\n0.79%\n0.82%\n0.78%\nImpact of changes in fair value of derivatives related to FIAs on the amortization of DPAC (*)\n(0.09%)\n(0.08%)\n(0.11%)\nAnnuity acquisition expenses as a % of fixed annuity benefits accumulated\n0.70%\n0.74%\n0.67%\n(*)\nAn estimate of the acceleration\/deceleration in the amortization of deferred policy acquisition costs resulting from fair value accounting for derivatives related to fixed-indexed annuities.\nSee\n\u201c\nAnnuity Unlocking\n\u201d\nbelow for a discussion of the impact that the periodic review of actuarial assumptions had on annuity and supplemental insurance acquisition expenses. Unanticipated spread compression, decreases in the stock market, adverse mortality experience, and higher than expected lapse rates could lead to write-offs of DPAC or PVFP in the future.\nAnnuity Other Expenses\nAnnuity other expenses were\n$110 million\nin\n2016\n,\n$96 million\nin\n2015\nand\n$82 million\nin\n2014\n, representing\nan increase\nof\n$14 million\n(\n15%\n) in\n2016\ncompared to\n2015\nand\nan increase\nof\n$14 million\n(\n17%\n) in\n2015\ncompared to\n2014\n.

As a percentage of average fixed annuity benefits accumulated, these expenses\nincreased\n0.02\npercentage points to\n0.38%\nfrom\n0.36%\nin\n2016\ncompared to\n2015\nand 0.02 percentage points to 0.36% from 0.34% in 2015 compared to 2014. The increase in annuity other expenses in\n2016\ncompared to\n2015\nprimarily reflects growth in the business as well as an increase in the number of sales personnel focused on new initiatives and increased market share within existing financial institutions and retail marketing associations. The increase in annuity other expenses in 2015 compared to 2014 primarily reflects higher expenses related to professional services and employee compensation plans in\n2015\n. Annuity other expenses for 2014 includes the favorable impact of settling certain accrued expenses at a lower cost than previously estimated.\nChange in Fair Value of Derivatives Related to Fixed-Indexed Annuities\nAFG\u2019s fixed-indexed annuities provide policyholders with a crediting rate tied, in part, to the performance of an existing stock market index. AFG attempts to mitigate the risk in the index-based component of these products through the purchase of call options on the appropriate index. AFG\u2019s strategy is designed so that the change in the fair value of the call option assets will generally offset the economic change in the liabilities from the index participation. Both the index-based component of the annuities and the related call options are considered derivatives that must be adjusted for changes in fair value through earnings each period. The fair values of these derivatives are impacted by actual and expected stock market performance and interest rates as well as other factors. For a list of other factors impacting the fair value of the index-based component of AFG\u2019s annuity benefits accumulated, see\nNote\nD\n\u2014 \u201c\nFair Value Measurements\n\u201d\nto the financial statements. Excluding the impact of unlocking charges, the net change in fair value of derivatives related to fixed-indexed annuities increased annuity benefits by\n$53 million\nin\n2016\n,\n$45 million\nin\n2015\nand $59 million in 2014. The increase in 2016 is due primarily to significantly lower than expected interest rates, partially offset by the impact of an increase in the stock market. The increase in 2015 reflects the negative impact of the decline in the stock market and lower than anticipated interest rates on these derivatives. The increase in 2014 is due primarily to the impact of lower than anticipated interest rates on these derivatives. As a percentage of average fixed annuity benefits accumulated, this net expense\nincreased\n0.01\npercentage points to\n0.19%\nfrom\n0.18%\nin\n2016\ncompared to\n2015\n, and decreased 0.09 percentage points to 0.18% from 0.27% in 2015 compared to 2014.\n87\nTable of Contents\nFluctuations in interest rates and the stock market, among other factors, can cause volatility in the periodic measurement of fair value of the embedded derivative that management believes can be inconsistent with the long-term economics of these products.

Management views this fee income, net of the\n$41 million\nin 2016 and\n$38 million\nin\n2015\n, in expenses incurred to generate such fees, as a reduction in the cost of underwriting its property and casualty insurance policies. Consistent with internal management reporting, these fees and the related expenses are netted and recorded as a reduction of commissions and other underwriting expenses in AFG\u2019s segmented results.

This increase reflects higher average indebtedness during 2015 compared to 2014, partially offset by a lower weighted average interest rate on outstanding debt and the favorable impact of the interest rate swap entered into in June 2015.\nThe increase in average indebtedness for 2015 as compared to 2014 reflects the following financing transactions completed by AFG between January 1, 2014 and December 31, 2015.\n\u2022\nIssued $150 million of 6% Subordinated Debentures in November 2015,\n\u2022\nRedeemed $132 million of 7% Senior Notes in September 2015,\n\u2022\nIssued $150 million of 6-1\/4% Subordinated Debentures in September 2014.\nHolding Company and Other \u2014 A&E Charges\nAs a result of the internal reviews and comprehensive external study of A&E exposures discussed under\n\u201c\nUncertainties\n\u2014\nAsbestos and Environmental-related (\u201cA&E\u201d) Insurance Reserves\n,\u201d\nAFG\u2019s holding companies and other operations outside of its insurance operations recorded non-core special charges of $5 million in\n2016\n, $12 million in\n2015\nand $6 million in\n2014\nto increase liabilities related to the A&E exposures of AFG\u2019s former railroad and manufacturing operations. The charge in\n2016\nis due to relatively small movements across several sites that primarily reflect changes in the scope and costs of investigation. The charges in\n2015\nand 2014 related to slightly higher estimated costs at sites where remediation is underway, coupled with higher estimated cleanup costs at a limited number of sites. Total charges recorded to increase liabilities for A&E exposures of AFG\u2019s former railroad and manufacturing operations (included in other expenses) were $20 million in 2016, $22 million in 2015 and $13 million in 2014.\nHolding Company and Other \u2014 Loss on Retirement of Debt\nAFG wrote off unamortized debt issuance costs of $4 million related to the redemption of its $132 million outstanding 7% Senior Notes due 2050 at par value on September 30, 2015.\nHolding Company and Other \u2014 Other Expenses\nExcluding the non-core special A&E charges and the non-core loss on retirement of debt discussed above, AFG\u2019s holding companies and other operations outside of its insurance operations recorded other expenses of\n$128 million\nin\n2016\ncompared to\n$115 million\nin\n2015\n, an increase of $13 million (11%). This increase reflects higher holding company expenses related to employee benefit plans that are tied to stock market performance, a $5 million donation to the University of Cincinnati College of Business in 2016 and higher expenses related to AFG\u2019s former railroad and manufacturing operations. AFG\u2019s holding companies and other operations outside of its insurance operations recorded other expenses of $115 million in\n2015\ncompared to $114 million in\n2014\n, an increase of $1 million (1%).\n93\nTable of Contents\nConsolidated Realized Gains (Losses) on Securities\nAFG\u2019s consolidated realized gains (losses) on securities, which are not allocated to segments, were gains of\n$19 million\nin\n2016\ncompared to losses of\n$19 million\nin\n2015\n, an increase of\n$38 million\n(\n200%\n).

In the second quarter of 2016, AFG received additional proceeds based on the final closing balance sheet and adjusted certain accrued expense estimates associated with the sale, resulting in a $2 million pretax favorable adjustment to the loss recorded in 2015. See\nNote\nB\n\u2014 \u201c\nAcquisitions and Sale of Businesses\n\u201d\nto the financial statements.

AFG will be required to adopt the updated guidance effective January 1, 2018 (early adoption is not permitted). Although recording changes in the fair value of investments in equity securities in net income will result in more volatility in AFG\u2019s Statement of Earnings, it is not expected to have a material effect on the carrying value of AFG\u2019s investments or on overall shareholders\u2019 equity as AFG\u2019s investments in equity securities are currently carried at fair value through accumulated other comprehensive income.\nIn February 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-02,\nLeases\n, which requires entities that lease assets for terms longer than one year to recognize the assets and liabilities for the rights and obligations created by those leases on the balance sheet based on the present value of cash flows. Qualitative and quantitative disclosures of the amount, timing and uncertainty of cash flows arising from leases will also be required. Although the guidance allows for early adoption, AFG expects to adopt the updated guidance effective January 1, 2019 (when it is required). The guidance will require the earliest comparative period presented to include the measurement and recognition of existing leases with an adjustment to shareholders\u2019 equity as if the updated guidance had always been applied. Although the guidance will result in higher assets and higher liabilities from the recognition of assets and liabilities related to operating leases, it does not change the manner in which lease expense is recognized in the statement of earnings. Although management is currently evaluating the impact of this guidance, AFG does not expect it to have a material effect on its results of operations or financial position.\nIn June 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-13,\nFinancial Instruments \u2013 Credit Losses: Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments,\nwhich provides a new credit loss model for determining credit-related impairments for financial instruments measured at amortized cost (e.g. mortgage loans or reinsurance recoverables) and requires an entity to estimate the credit losses expected over the life of an exposure or pool of exposures. The estimate of expected credit losses considers historical information, current information, as well as reasonable and supportable forecasts, including estimates of prepayments. The expected credit losses, and subsequent increases or decreases in such losses, will be recorded immediately through realized gains (losses) as an allowance that is deducted from the amortized cost basis of the financial asset, with the net carrying value of the financial asset presented on the balance sheet at the amount expected to be collected. The updated guidance also amends the current other-than-temporary impairment model for available for sale debt securities by requiring the recognition of impairments relating to credit losses through an allowance account and limits the amount of credit loss to the difference between a security\u2019s amortized cost basis and its fair value. Subsequent increases or decreases in expected credit losses will be\n95\nTable of Contents\nrecorded immediately in the income statement through realized gains (losses). AFG will be required to adopt this guidance effective January 1, 2020. AFG cannot estimate the impact that the updated guidance will have on its results of operations, financial position or liquidity until the updated guidance is adopted.","35":"","36":"","37":"","38":"","39":"","40":"","41":"ITEM 7.  MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nThe following discussion should be read in conjunction with the audited consolidated financial statements and the related notes to the consolidated financial statements included in this Form 10-K.\nManagement Overview\nAt the end of 2008, we launched our new business concept of medical services and technology that delivers turnkey solutions to spine surgeons, orthopedic surgeons and other healthcare providers for necessary, reasonable and appropriate treatment for musculo-skeletal spine injuries. Moving forward, our main focus will be on the expansion and development of spine injury diagnostic centers across the nation.\nResults of Operations\nFor the year ended December 31, 2016 versus 2015.\nWe recorded $2,117,078 in net revenues with $689,101 in costs of services and gross profit of $1,427,977 for the year ended December 31, 2016.  For the year ended December 31, 2015, we recorded $2,192,181 in net revenues with $849,756 in costs of services and gross profit of $1,342,425.  Revenue for 2016 was down due to our center in San Antonio electing not to continue the business relationship.\nWe recognize revenue by reference to \u201cnet revenue,\u201d which is gross amounts billed using CPT codes less account discounts that are expected to result when individual cases are ultimately settled.  A discount rate of a 48% based on settled patient cases, was used to determine net revenue during 2016 and 2015. Accordingly, we had gross revenues of $3,537,791 with net revenues of $2,117,078 for the year ended December 31, 2016, versus gross revenues of $4,384,362 with net revenues of $2,192,181 for the year ended December 31, 2015.  The Company realized better than expected collections during 2016 related to its outstanding accounts receivable.\nExpenses\nFor the year ended December 31, 2016 versus 2015.\nOperating, general and administrative expenses for the year ended December 31, 2016 were $2,087,266 as compared to $2,085,986 for the year ended December 31, 2015. Operating expenses were relatively flat due to an increase to bad debt expense offset by a decrease in legal costs, consulting costs, and marketing costs.\nBad debt expense, included in operating, general and administrative expenses, totaled $683,338 and $467,600, respectively, for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015. The increase in bad debt expense is primarily attributable to our decision to discontinue doing business in Florida in 2014, which has resulted in limited personnel and affiliates in the region to assist in collection efforts. While we continue to pursue all amounts owed, we increased the allowance for bad debt related to Florida accounts to reflect collection trends in Florida.\nOther income (expense) for the year ended December 31, 2016 was an expense of $50,995 as compared to expense of $52,267 for the year ended December 31, 2015. For the twelve months ended December 31, 2016, other income was $7,057 offset by expenses of $58,052.  For the year ended December 31, 2015, other income was $10,234 offset by expenses of $62,501. The small decrease in expense 2016 versus 2015 is primarily attributable to the restructuring of our debt from high interest notes to our line of credit with Wells Fargo which bears interest at the 30 day London Interbank Offered Rate (\u201cLIBOR\u201d) plus 2%, resulting in an effective rate of 2.77% at December 31, 2016.\nNet Income or Loss\nFor the year ended December 31, 2016 versus 2015.\nNet loss for the year ended December 31, 2016 was $755,945 compared to net loss of $1,057,604 for the year ended December 31, 2015.  Lower operating expenses, coupled with reduced interest costs, and lower personnel costs to develop and market the Quad Video Halo, resulted in net loss decreasing in 2016 from 2015.\n14\nTable of Contents\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nFor the year ended December 31, 2016 versus 2015.\nDuring 2016, cash provided in operating activities was $202,616 as compared to $429,297 of cash used in 2015.  The increase in cash generated in operations was mainly due to an increase in collections from our spine injury diagnostic centers, especially Odessa, coupled with higher noncash charges. These provisions were offset by uses of cash for increased inventory of Quad Video Halo units.  Our settlement collections totaled $2,378,793 in 2016 compared to $2,193,094 in 2015.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2016, we did not purchase any Quad Video Halo equipment versus a purchase of similar equipment of $50,108 in 2015, resulting in cash used in investing activities.\nCash flows used in financing activities totaled $120,000 for the year ended December 31, 2016, consisting of a payment of current debt of $250,000, and $130,000 of draws on our line of credit. For the year ended December 31, 2015, cash flows provided from financing activities totaled $295,000, consisting of a payment of long- term debt of $350,000, draws of $645,000 on the line of credit.\nWe have debt totaling $300,000 that is due in August 2017 to our director Peter Dalrymple and the additional $50,000 that is due March 2017 to a third party.  We anticipate using the line of credit to cover these payments as we continue to seek new business or we will attempt to restructure the notes.\nCapital Expenditures\nWe purchased components for a Quad Video Halo system and other assets for the warehouse at a cost of $50,108 in the year ended December 31, 2015.  There were no capital expenditures in 2016.\nIncome Tax Expense (Benefit)\nWe have experienced losses and as a result have net operating loss carryforwards available to offset future taxable income.\nCritical Accounting Policies\nIn Note 3 to the audited consolidated financial statements for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015 included in this Form 10-K, we discuss those accounting policies that are considered to be significant in determining the results of operations and our financial position. The following critical accounting policies and estimates are important in the preparation of our financial statements.\nUse of Estimates\nThe preparation of financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires our management to make significant estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses. By their nature, these judgments are subject to an inherent degree of uncertainty. On an ongoing basis, we evaluate estimates. We base our estimates on historical experience and other facts and circumstances that we believe to be reasonable, and the results form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities. The actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions.\nRevenue Recognition and Accounts Receivable\nWe conform to the guidance provided by SEC Staff Accounting Bulletin, Topic 13, \u201cRevenue Recognition.\u201d  Persuasive evidence of an arrangement is obtained prior to services being rendered when the patient completes and signs the medical and financial paperwork.  Delivery of services is considered to have occurred when medical diagnostic services are provided to the patient.  The price and terms for the services are considered fixed and determinable at the time that the medical services are provided and are based upon the type and extent of the services rendered.  Our credit policy has been established based upon extensive experience by management in the industry and has been determined to ensure that collectability is reasonably assured.  Payment for services are primarily made to us by a third party and the credit policy includes terms of net 240 days for collections.\n15\nTable of Contents\nWe recognize revenue and accounts receivable in accordance with SEC staff accounting bulletin, Topic 13, \u201cRevenue Recognition\u201d, which requires persuasive evidence that a sales arrangement exists; the fee is fixed or determinable; and collection is reasonably assured before revenue is recognized. The patients are billed by the healthcare provider based on Current Procedural Terminology (\u201cCPT\u201d) codes for the medical procedure performed. CPT codes are numbers assigned to every task and service a medical practitioner may provide to a patient including medical, surgical and diagnostic services. CPT codes are developed, maintained and copyrighted by the American Medical Association. Patients are billed at the normal billing amount, based on national averages, for a particular CPT code procedure.\nRevenue and corresponding accounts receivable are recognized by reference to \u201cnet revenue\u201d and \u201caccounts receivable, net\u201d which is defined as gross amounts billed using CPT codes less account discounts that are expected to result when individual cases are ultimately settled.  While we do collect 100% of the accounts on some patients, our historical collection rate is used to calculate the carrying balance of the accounts receivable and the estimated revenue to be recorded.   A discount rate of 48%, based on payment history, was used to reduce revenue to 52% of CPT code billings (\u201cgross revenue\u201d) during the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015.\nAccounting Standards Updates\nIn Note 3 to the audited consolidated financial statements for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015 included in this Form 10-K, we discuss those recent accounting pronouncements that may be considered to be significant in determining the results of operations and our financial position.\nGoing Concern\nSince our inception in 1998, until commencement of our spine injury diagnostic operations in August, 2009, our expenses substantially exceeded our revenue, resulting in continuing losses and an accumulated deficit from operations of $15,004,698 as of December 31, 2009.  Since that time, our accumulated deficit has increased $2,145,942 to $17,150,640 as of December 31, 2016. During the year ended December 31, 2016, we realized net revenue of $2,117,078 and a net loss of $755,945. Successful business operations and our transition to attaining profitability are dependent upon obtaining additional financing and achieving a level of revenue adequate to support our cost structure. Considering the nature of the business, we are not generating immediate liquidity and sufficient working capital within a reasonable period of time to fund our planned operations and strategic business plan through December 31, 2017. There can be no assurances that there will be adequate financing available to us. The accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared assuming that we will continue as a going concern. This basis of accounting contemplates the recovery of our assets and the satisfaction of liabilities in the normal course of business. The consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments to reflect the possible future effects on the recoverability and classification of assets or the amounts and classification of liabilities that may result from the outcome of this uncertainty.","42":"ITEM 7.\nMANAGEMENT\u2019S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nTHE FOLLOWING DISCUSSION OF THE COMPANY\u2019S FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS SHOULD BE READ IN CONJUNCTION WITH ITS CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND RELATED NOTES INCLUDED ELSEWHERE IN THIS ANNUAL REPORT ON FORM 10-K.

We began sales of our SMB product in the third quarter of 2016.\nIn May 2016, we launched the magicJack Connect App for iOS and Android. The magicJack Connect App offers users free worldwide Wi-Fi App-to-App calling & messaging. The magicJack Connect App also offers an unlimited U.S. calling plan which allows subscribers to call the U.S. from anywhere in the world plus receive a U.S. phone number for only $9.99 per year.\n40\nBasis of Presentation\nOur consolidated financial statements are prepared in conformity with U.S. GAAP, and are the basis for the discussion and analysis of our results of operations, liquidity and capital resource. References to authoritative accounting literature in this report, where applicable, are based on the Accounting Standards Codification (\u201cASC\u201d). Our functional and reporting currency is the United States Dollar (\u201cU.S. Dollar\u201d), which is the currency of the primary economic environment in which our consolidated operations are conducted. Transactions and balances originally denominated in dollars are presented at their original amounts. Transactions and balances in currencies other than dollars, including Israeli New Shekel (\u201dNIS\u201d), are re-measured in dollars and any gains or losses are recognized in our consolidated financial statements in the period they occur.\nWe have historically prepared our consolidated financial statements on the basis of being a single reporting entity. Beginning in the first quarter of 2016, with the acquisition of Broadsmart and the internal development of our SMB division, we have been reporting the results of operations for these new business lines as separate Reportable Segments.\nRefer to Note 16, \u201cSegment Reporting,\u201d in the Notes to our Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 herein for further details.\nApproximately 87% of our consolidated revenues in the year ended December 31, 2016 and 90% of our revenues in the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014 were derived from sales to customers located in the United States. The majority of our revenues were generated from sales of the magicJack device and from the accompanying software access rights, which were $77.6 million, $86.8 million and $99.2 million for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively. We also provide our customers the ability to make prepaid calls using a magicJack device or magicJack App by purchasing prepaid minutes. Revenues generated from the usage of prepaid minutes were $5.7 million, $8.2 million and $10.1 million for years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively.\nThe majority of our Enterprise segment revenues recognized were generated from Broadsmart hosted\nUCaaS\nservices and sales of hardware and equipment which were $9.0 million post acquisition for the year ended December 31, 2016.  We had no UCaaS revenue from Broadsmart for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, prior to acquisition.\nOur SMB segment did not generate significant revenue for the year ended December 31, 2016. There was no revenue for SMB for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014.\nBasis of Consolidation\nOur consolidated financial statements include the accounts of magicJack VocalTec Ltd. and its wholly-owned subsidiaries, YMax Corporation, YMax Communications Corp., magicJack Holdings Corporation, magicJack, LP, Tiger Jet Network, Inc., VocalTec Communications, LLC (\u201cVocalTec US\u201d, formerly Stratus Telecommunications, LLC), Broadsmart Global, Inc., and magicJack SMB, Inc.. The results of Broadsmart Global, Inc. have been included since March 17, 2016.  Refer to Note 15, \u201cAcquisition of Business,\u201d in the Notes to our Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 herein for further details. The results of SMB have been included since the first quarter of 2016.  All intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation. Certain reclassifications have been made to prior period financial statement amounts to conform to the current presentation.\nUse of Estimates\nThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period. Such estimates and judgments are revised periodically as required. Actual results could differ from those estimates. Significant estimates include allowances for billing adjustments and doubtful accounts, the recoverability of long-lived assets and goodwill, income taxes, income tax valuation allowance, uncertain tax liabilities, the value of ordinary shares issued in business combinations or underlying our ordinary share options, the expected forfeitures of ordinary share options and estimates of likely outcomes related to certain contingent liabilities.\nWe evaluate our estimates on an ongoing basis. Our estimates and assumptions are based on factors such as historical experience, trends within the Company and the telecommunications industry, general economic conditions and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. The results of such assumptions form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily available. Actual results may differ from our estimates and assumptions as a result of varying market and economic conditions, and may result in lower revenues and lower operating income.\n41\nCRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES\nWe have identified below our critical accounting policies. These policies are both the most important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations and require our management\u2019s most difficult, subjective and complex judgments and estimates. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions.\nREVENUE RECOGNITION\nWe recognize revenue in accordance with ASC Topic 605, \"Revenue Recognition\" (\u201cASC 605\u201d), which provides authoritative guidance on revenue recognition. For arrangements that include more than one product or service (\u201cdeliverables\u201d), we apply Section 25 of ASC 605, \u201cMultiple-Element Arrangements\u201d. ASC 605-25 establishes criteria for separating deliverables into different units of accounting and allocating consideration to those units of accounting.\nCore Consumer Segment\nFor the Core Consumer business, net revenues consist of revenues from sales of the magicJack devices to retailers, wholesalers or directly to customers, access rights fees, fees charged for shipping the magicJack devices, usage of prepaid minutes, access charges to other carriers and other miscellaneous charges for telecommunication related products and services. Revenues are recorded net of sales returns and allowances.\nmagicJack Devices and Access Right Renewals\nmagicJack devices include an initial access right, which qualify as multiple deliverables per ASC 605-25.  Since the device and initial access right are interdependent and not sold separately, they are accounted for as a combined unit of accounting. Direct sales of devices include shipping charges and 30 days to return the device and cancel the service.  For retail sales of devices, there is a delay between shipment to the retailer and the ultimate sale to a customer (end-user). Based on sales and inventory data provided by retail partners, our estimate of the delay for the year ending December 31, 2016 was 90 days. We defer revenue recognition on direct sales for the 30 day return period and on retail sales for the delay period, after which we recognize the revenue from device sales and shipping charges, if applicable, ratably over the remaining initial access right period.\nCustomers may renew access rights for periods ranging from one month to five years. The revenue associated with access right renewals is deferred and recognized ratably over the extended access right period. Revenue from mobile apps is included as part of Access Right Renewals and recognized ratably over the access right period.\nSales Return Policy\nWe offer some of our direct sales customers a 30-day free trial before they have to pay for their magicJack device. We do not recognize revenue until the 30-day trial period has expired and a customer\u2019s credit card has been charged.\nReturns from retailers are accepted on an authorized basis for devices deemed defective. We may offer certain retailers the limited right to return any unsold merchandise from their initial stocking orders. We also accept returns of battery powerbanks for mobile devices within 30 days of sale.\nWe estimate potential returns under these arrangements at point of sale and re-estimate them on a quarterly basis.\nFor the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, our estimates of returns and actual returns from initial stocking orders have not been materially different.\nOther magicJack-Related Products\nWe offer customers other optional products related to their magicJack devices and services, such as insurance, custom or vanity phone numbers, Canadian phone numbers, the ability to either change their existing phone numbers or port them to a magicJack device, and battery powerbanks for mobile devices. These revenues are recognized at the time of sale, with the exception of sales of the battery powerbank which are recognized when shipped.\nPrepaid Minutes and Access and Wholesale Charges\nWe generate revenues from sales of prepaid international minutes to customers, fees charged to telecommunication carriers or providers for origination of their calls to 800-numbers, and access fees charged to other telecommunication carriers or providers on a per-minute basis for IXC calls terminated to our end-users. Revenues from access fee charges to other telecommunication carriers are recorded based on rates set forth in the respective state and federal tariffs or negotiated contract rates, less a provision for billing adjustments. Revenues from prepaid minutes and access and wholesale charges are recognized as minutes are used.\n42\nEnterprise Segment\nFor the Enterprise segment, net revenues consist of revenues from the sale of hosted services, usage charges, hardware and network equipment sales, and other one-time miscellaneous service charges.\nUCaaS services and equipment provided by our Broadsmart subsidiary qualify as multiple deliverables per ASC 605-25.  Since the equipment and services are sold separately and can be used with other products and services, they are accounted for as separate units of accounting. We recognize revenues from sales of our hosted services in the period the services are provided over the term of the respective customer agreements. Customers are billed monthly in advance for these recurring services and in arrears for one time service charges and other certain usage charges.  Revenues from sales of hardware and network equipment are recognized in the period that the equipment is delivered. Revenues from the sale of equipment purchased but not yet delivered and installed is deferred and recognized in the period that the hardware or equipment is put into service.\nSMB Segment\nSMB provides phone equipment and services that are interdependent and not sold separately. As such, they are accounted for as a combined unit of accounting under ASC 605-25.  Some agreements include a refund period or a promotion for free introductory service.  Revenue recognition is deferred for either period, after which we recognize the revenue for the combined unit ratably over the remaining service period.  Revenues from this segment were not significant for the year ended December 31, 2016.\nGOODWILL AND OTHER INTANGIBLE ASSETS\nGoodwill represents the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of the identifiable net assets acquired. Goodwill and other identifiable intangible assets with indefinite lives are not amortized to operations, but are instead reviewed for impairment at least annually, or more frequently if there is an indicator of impairment. Indicators include, but are not limited to: sustained operating losses or a trend of poor operating performance and a decrease in our market capitalization below its book value.\nThe valuation methodology we use for assessing potential impairment requires management to make judgments and assumptions based on historical experience and projections of future operating performance. If these assumptions differ materially from actual future results, we may record impairment charges in the future.\nAs part of our annual\nimpairment\nreview\nfor goodwill and other identifiable intangible assets with indefinite lives\n, performed as of October 1, 2016 (the \u201cMeasurement Date\u201d),\nmanagement determined that there were impairment indicators at the Enterprise Segment.  Based on these indicators and the new reporting units for goodwill,\nwe engaged an independent third party to perform a valuation of\nBroadsmart\u2019s\nintangible assets and a two-step goodwill impairment test for each of our reporting units.\nThe third party valuation as of October 1, 2016 was used to test the Enterprise segment\u2019s identified intangible assets subject to amortization for impairment.  Management summed the undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use of these assets and their eventual disposition used in the third party valuation report and noted that the sum exceeded the carrying amount of the assets, indicating no further impairment testing was necessary for these assets as of October 1, 2016. Refer to Note 6, \u201cIntangible Assets\u201d in the Notes to our Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 herein for further details.\nThe third party valuation as of October 1, 2016 determined the fair value of Broadsmart\u2019s identified intangible assets not subject to amortization based on the relief from royalty method, which requires an estimate of a reasonable royalty rate, identification of relevant projected revenues and expenses, and selection of an appropriate discount rate. This valuation yielded an estimated fair value of $1.7 million for the Broadsmart tradename.  This tradename was recorded as an identifiable intangible asset with an indefinite life at a carrying value of $2.2 million. As a result, an impairment loss of $0.5 million was recognized in General and Administrative expense for the fourth quarter of 2016 under the Enterprise segment in the statement of operations related to the tradename.\nUnder the first step of the goodwill test as of October 1, 2016, the fair value of each reporting unit was compared with its carrying value (including goodwill).  The fair value was determined based on a discounted future cash-flows approach.  The Core Consumer reporting unit passed the first step with fair value in excess of carrying value by approximately 227% and no further testing was required. The SMB segment had no goodwill and no further testing was required.  The Enterprise reporting unit did not pass the first step and further testing was required.\nUnder the second step of the goodwill test as of October 1, 2016, the carrying amount of the Enterprise reporting unit\u2019s (Broadsmart\u2019s) goodwill was compared to its implied fair value. The implied fair value of goodwill was determined by allocating the fair value of the reporting unit\u2019s assets and liabilities in a manner similar to a purchase price allocation with the residual fair value being the implied fair value of goodwill. The fair value of the reporting unit was determined using a discounted cash flow analysis. The Enterprise segment passed the second step with implied fair value of goodwill exceeding carrying value by approximately 35%.\n43\nBased on this testing, we determined that there was no impairment of goodwill as of our annual goodwill impairment test date of October 1, 2016 .  Refer to Note 7, \u201cGoodwill\u201d in the Notes to our Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 herein for further details.\nManagement continued to monitor the performance of the Enterprise segment\/reporting unit (Broadsmart) and updated its impairment analysis of intangible assets not subject to amortization, goodwill and the identified intangible assets subject to amortization as of December 31, 2016. No further impairment charges were required as a result of this analysis.\nAlthough the acquired\nBroadsmart\nbusiness\nhas underperformed compared to\nour expectations\n, we believe that the underlying fundamentals of the Broadsmart business and the exhibited market opportunities for growth remain consistent with our understanding and analysis of the business at the time of acquisition.  Subsequent to the year ended December 31, 2016, we\nimplemented\nsteps to improve the operating results and bolster integration efforts for the Broadsmart business.  In February 2017, we hired a new Chief Operating Officer for Broadsmart to reduce the administrative and organizational duties of Broadsmart\u2019s original founders, who continue to be employed by us and are integral to its success, so that they can focus on expanding the customer base. We have also begun to hire additional sales and marketing personnel dedicated to obtaining new business. We believe that the\nEnterprise\nreporting unit will eventually perform at originally expected levels but more time is needed to give these integration efforts an opportunity to be successful. If these efforts are not successful, we will need to re-evaluate our forecasts for the\nEnterprise\nreporting unit. Further impairments could ensue if Broadsmart continues to perform below expectations.\nINCOME TAXES\nWe recognize deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected tax consequences of temporary differences between the tax basis of assets and liabilities and their book basis using enacted tax rates. Any changes in enacted rates or tax laws are included in the provision for income taxes in the year of enactment. Our net deferred tax assets consist primarily of foreign net operating loss carryforwards and timing differences between the recognition of income for book and tax purposes. We record a valuation allowance to reduce the net deferred tax assets to the amount that we estimate is more-likely-than-not to be realized. We evaluated the valuation allowance as of December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014 which resulted in adjustments of ($1.2 million) to bring the allowance to $16.3 million, $1.3 million to bring the allowance to $17.5 million, and $1.2 million to bring the allowance to $16.2 million, respectively.  These amounts adjust the net deferred tax assets to the amount that will more-likely-than-not be realized. We periodically review the composition of our net deferred tax assets and related valuation allowances and will continue to make adjustments if available evidence indicates that it is more-likely-than-not a change in the carrying amounts is required.\nWe assess our income tax positions and record tax benefits for all years subject to examination based upon our evaluation of the facts, circumstances and information available at the reporting date. For those tax positions where there is a greater than 50% likelihood that a tax benefit will be sustained, we have recorded the largest amount of tax benefit that may potentially be realized upon ultimate settlement with a taxing authority that has full knowledge of all relevant information. For those income tax positions where there is 50% or less likelihood that a tax benefit will be sustained, no tax benefit has been recognized in the financial statements. For the year ended December 31, 2016, we recorded a provision for uncertain tax positions of ($0.3) million. For the year ended December 31, 2015, our provision for uncertain tax positions was reduced by $10.1 million primarily due to the settlement of the IRS audits for tax years 2010 through 2013.  As of December 31, 2016 and 2015, the liability for uncertain tax positions totaled $10.4 million and $10.8 million, respectively. The current portion of such liability, if any, has been reflected in income taxes payable. There was no current portion of uncertain tax positions as of December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively. The noncurrent portion of such liability, $10.4 million and $10.8 million as of December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively, has been reflected in other non-current liabilities.\nIn November 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-17, \u201cBalance Sheet Classification of Deferred Taxes\u201d. ASU 2015-17 requires deferred tax liabilities and assets to be classified as noncurrent in the consolidated balance sheet. The standard is effective for financial statements issued for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2016, and interim periods within those annual periods. Early adoption is permitted for financial statements that have not been previously issued. The ASU may be applied either prospectively to all deferred tax liabilities and assets or retrospectively to all periods presented. The Company adopted ASU 2015-17 on a prospective basis in the fourth quarter of 2015. Prior periods were not retrospectively adjusted.\nWe file U.S. federal and state and foreign income tax returns in jurisdictions with varying statutes of limitations.  During fiscal 2013, we received notice that the IRS was going to examine our tax returns for 2010 and 2011. In October 2014, we were informed that the IRS was going to expand its audit to include our 2012 and 2013 tax returns. During 2015, we reached agreement with the IRS on a settlement of all years under audit. The settlement resulted in an increase to the jurisdictional income of the U.S. The additional tax and interest due to the IRS and various state taxing authorities as a result of the increased U.S. jurisdictional income was $6.8 million and $0.9 million, respectively.  We were able to utilize approximately $4.2 million of benefits related to other favorable adjustments identified during the exam to satisfy a portion of the federal liability, resulting in net tax and interest paid to the IRS of $2.6 million. The $0.9 million state liability is reflected as a reduction to prepaid income taxes in our December 31, 2015 consolidated balance sheets. The increase to the U.S. jurisdictional income resulted in a decrease in our Israeli jurisdictional income. The decrease in Israeli income, in turn, increased our Israeli net operating losses, resulting in a tax benefit of $5.6 million. For year ended December 31, 2016, we recorded income tax expense of $8.7 million, which is higher than the expected tax provision of $4.7 million, using the statutory rate of 34%, due, in part, to the net impact of a decrease in the Israeli corporate tax rate from 26.5% to 23.0% which was effective in December 2016. The decrease in the rate resulted in the need to reduce our Israeli deferred tax assets, primarily net operating loss carryforwards, which resulted in deferred tax expense and a reduction in the value of related deferred tax assets of $5.2 million. Additionally, the effective tax rate was impacted by decreases to uncertain tax positions of ($0.8 million), decreases in valuation allowances of ($1.2 million), and other items of $0.\n8\nmillion. The discrete items noted above were partially offset by the lower jurisdictional tax rate charged on the operating income of our Israeli operations. The tax years 2011 through 2016 remain open to examination by other major taxing jurisdictions to which we are subject.\n44\nSHARE-BASED COMPENSATION\nShare-based compensation generally consists of option grants or ordinary share and restricted stock units awards to directors, officers, employees or consultants. We account for share-based compensation in accordance with ASC Topic 718, \"Compensation - Stock Compensation\" (\u201cASC 718\u201d). ASC 718 requires companies to estimate the fair value of equity-based payment awards on the date of grant based on the fair value of the award. The value of the portion of the award that is ultimately expected to vest is recognized as an expense over the requisite service periods in our consolidated statements of operations.\nBUSINESS TRENDS\nRevenues in our Core Consumer segment continued to decline during the year ended December 31, 2016. We remain encouraged by the loyalty of our existing customer base and we continue to undertake efforts to improve our customer renewal rates and limit customer churn.\nW\nith the launch of magicJack Connect to both iOS and Android customers, we are increasing our efforts to reposition the device with its companion App service. We believe that there will continue to be solid consumer demand for our low priced, unlimited phone service, whether through our magicJack device, our\nmobile\nApp\ns\n, or a combination of both.\nOn March 17, 2016, we completed the acquisition of substantially all of the assets of Broadsmart. In connection with the acquisition, we formed a new subsidiary, Broadsmart Global, Inc. Broadsmart has a track record of provisioning and delivering complex Unified Communication as a Service (UCaaS) solutions to blue chip corporate customers on a nationwide basis. It has expertise in servicing enterprises with hundreds-to-thousands of locations. We believe that if we successfully execute, there is significant growth potential for Broadsmart in the UCaaS space.\nThe two founders of Broadsmart have remained with the business as CEO and President, respectively, of Broadsmart Global, Inc. With the acquisition of Broadsmart, we are diversifying beyond our Core Consumer business into UCaaS targeting high end SMB and enterprise customers.  Broadsmart has demonstrated that they know how to sell and service large enterprise customers with complex needs at thousands of locations in multiple geographies.  We intend to fully support them in maximizing their promising pipeline for new business and are exploring opportunities for Broadsmart to realize synergies by leveraging magicJack\u2019s proprietary low cost infrastructure.\nAlthough the acquired  Broadsmart business has\nunderperformed compared to our expectations\n, we believe that the underlying fundamentals of the UCaaS business and the exhibited market opportunities for growth remain consistent with our understanding and analysis of the business at the time of acquisition. As a consequence of the underperformance, in 2016 we recognized a $0.5 million impairment on the Broadsmart trade name. Refer to Note 6, \u201cIntangible Assets\u201d in the Notes to our Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 herein for further details.  Subsequent to the year ended December 31, 2016, we implemented steps to improve the operating results and bolster integration efforts for the Broadsmart business.  In February 2017, we hired a new Chief Operating Officer for Broadsmart to reduce the administrative and organizational duties of Broadsmart\u2019s original founders, so that they can focus on expanding the customer base. We have also begun to hire additional sales and marketing personnel dedicated to obtaining new business. We believe that the business will eventually perform at originally expected levels but more time is needed to give these integration efforts an opportunity to be successful. If these efforts are not successful, we will need to re-evaluate our forecasts for the business. Further impairments could ensue if Broadsmart continues to  perform below expectations.\nIn addition to the Broadsmart acquisition, we are further transitioning towards business customers with the launch of our new SMB\nsegment\n. We expect that this business line will leverage our core assets and give us the ability to sell services at disruptive pricing to small-to-medium business customers. While we did not recognize significant revenue from\nSMB in 2016, we believe that in the long term, if we successfully execute on this growth initiative, it has the potential to generate significant shareholder value.\nFurthermore, in May 2016, we launched the magicJack Connect App for iOS and Android. The magicJack Connect App offers users free worldwide Wi-Fi App-to-App calling & messaging. The App also offers an unlimited U.S. calling plan which allows subscribers to call the U.S. from anywhere in the world plus receive a U.S. phone number for only $9.99 per year. With in-App purchase capability, other offers available on the magicJack Connect App include international calling plans for select countries, the ability to purchase local phone numbers from over 40 countries, and the ability to purchase international calling credits for consumers that prefer pay-as-you go options. We are focused on driving sales growth through monetizing magicJack Connect. The magicJack Connect App competes with other large, well-capitalized global companies in the telecom App industry who are introducing low priced consumer offers into the marketplace on an ongoing basis. Accordingly, we cannot assure that the features we are offering for monetization of the magicJack Connect App will be attractive to consumers at the price points we are offering, or at all.\nWith the acquisition of Broadsmart, the investment in the magicJack SMB business and the continued efforts in improving and promoting the magicJack Connect App, we have taken significant steps to diversify our business from the Core Consumer segment and into the SMB and UCaaS space, with magicJack SMB targeting smaller businesses and Broadsmart serving medium to large enterprises.\nIn 2017, we intend to focus on launching new services targeting Small Office Home Office (\u201cSOHO\u201d), pursuing a mobile-first, web-first strategy.  We believe that because of our vertically integrated operations and CLEC network with significant excess capacity, we can be both competitively price disruptive and profitable at the same time, similar to the historical magicJack Core Consumer business.  We believe this strategy leverages existing assets and recent R&D investment, and is a webfocused customer acquisition and UCaaS model. We plan to consolidate operations and to eliminate redundant SMB segment functions in Atlanta. We are also planning on eliminating unproductive or less-promising ventures, including our partnership with Telefonica and the Hotelijack initiative. We have recruited a new executive team to execute this strategy.\nWhile we are\nexcited by the new direction that we are planning for 2017 and\nthe\npotential inherent in the\nacquisition of Broadsmart, there can be no assurance that these initiatives will be successful and we cannot predict what impact, if any, these initiatives will ultimately have on our business, results of operations, financial condition or cash flows.\n45\nSIGNIFICANT CHANGES IN FINANCIAL POSITION\nThe following table presents significant changes in our consolidated balance sheets for the periods indicated (in thousands).\nDecember 31,\nDecember 31,\nDecember 31,\n2016\ncompared to\n2015\ncompared to\n2016\n2015\n2014\n2015\n2014\nCash and cash equivalents\n$52,394\n$78,589\n$75,945\n$(26,195\n)\n$2,644\nInventories\n$4,441\n$5,723\n$5,635\n$(1,282\n)\n$88\nPrepaid income taxes\n$527\n$2,747\n$12,513\n$(2,220\n)\n$(9,766\n)\nDeferred tax assets, current\n$-\n$-\n$13,341\n$-\n$(13,341\n)\nReceivable from earnout escrow\n$2,000\n$-\n$-\n$2,000\n$-\nIntangible assets, net\n$28,854\n$6,687\n$9,473\n$22,167\n$(2,786\n)\nGoodwill\n$47,185\n$32,304\n$32,304\n$15,181\n$-\nIncome tax payable\n$1,527\n$-\n$9,197\n$1,527\n$(9,197\n)\nTotal deferred revenue\n$92,708\n$102,700\n$111,227\n$(9,992\n)\n$(8,527\n)\nOther non-current liabilities\n$10,866\n$11,098\n$13,438\n$(232\n)\n$(2,340\n)\nYEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2016 COMPARED TO YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2015\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2016, cash and cash equivalents decreased $26.2 million, primarily reflecting $40.0 million used in the acquisition of Broadsmart, partially offset by $15.3 million provided by operations. A detailed discussion of this change is provided in \u201cLiquidity and Capital Resources\u201d.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2016, inventories decreased $1.3 million due to reduced purchases of magicJack devices reflecting lower year-over-year sales volumes.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2016, prepaid income taxes decreased $2.2 million, income tax payable increased $1.\n5\nmillion and other non-current liabilities decreased $0.2 million due to recognition of 2016 income taxes.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2016, receivable from earnout escrow increased $2.0 million.  This item represents amounts placed in escrow as part of the Broadsmart acquisition, as contingent consideration to the sellers if the Broadsmart business generated\n2016 revenues equal to or exceeding $15.6 million (the \"Earnout Payment\")\n.  The 2016 revenue target was not achieved and the funds are now expected to be returned to us.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2016, intangible assets increased $22.2 million.   The increase in intangible assets is primarily attributable to $26.4 million in additions from the acquisition of Broadsmart, partially offset by: (i) amortization expense of $3.5 million and (ii) impairments of $1.0 million.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2016, goodwill increased $14.9 million due to the acquisition of Broadsmart.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2016, total deferred revenue decreased $10.0 million due primarily to the recognition of 2015 deferred revenue exceeding the deferral associated with 2016 sales.\nYEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2015 COMPARED TO YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2014\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2015, cash and cash equivalents increased $2.6 million, primarily reflecting $25.4 million provided by operations, partially offset by $20.0 million used to repurchase treasury stock as part of our share repurchase program. A detailed discussion of this change is provided in \u201cLiquidity and Capital Resources\u201d.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2015, prepaid income taxes decreased $9.8 million, income tax payable decreased $9.2 million deferred tax assets, current decreased $13.3 million and other non-current liabilities decreased $2.3 million reflecting (i) adoption of ASU 2015-17, which requires deferred tax liabilities and assets to be classified as noncurrent in the consolidated balance sheet and (ii) settlement of an IRS audit for the years ended December 31, 2010, 2011, 2012 and 2013.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2015, intangible assets decreased $2.8 million due to amortization expense.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2015, total deferred revenue decreased $8.5 million due primarily to the recognition of 2014 deferred revenue exceeding the deferral associated with 2015 sales.\n46\nRESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nThe following table presents our consolidated results of operations for the periods indicated (in thousands, except per share information).

These revenues are recorded net of sales allowance, chargebacks, retailer discounts and advertising allowances;\n\u00b7\nAccess right renewals \u2013 represent revenues from customers purchasing rights to access our servers beyond the initial access right period included with a magicJack device or magicJack service. The extended access right ranges from one to five years. These fees charged to customers are initially deferred and recognized as revenue ratably over the extended access right period. These revenues also include revenues from access rights granted to users of the magicApp and magicJack Connect App which are recognized ratably over the access right period;\n\u00b7\nShipping and handling \u2013 represent charges for shipping and handling fees for magicJack devices shipped directly to customers. The fees are initially deferred and recognized as revenues over the initial three, six or twelve month access right period associated with the magicJack device;\n\u00b7\nmagicJack-related products \u2013 represent revenues recognized from sale of other items related to the magicJack devices and access right renewals we offer our customers, including: (i) porting fees charged to customers to port their existing phone number to a magicJack device or service, (ii) fees charged for customers to select a custom, vanity or Canadian phone number, (iii) fees charged to customers to change their existing number, (iv) insurance covering the replacement of a damaged or lost device, and (v) sale of battery powerbanks. These revenues are recognized at the time of sale, with the exception of sales of the battery powerbank which are recognized when shipped;\n\u00b7\nPrepaid minutes \u2013 represents revenues recognized primarily from the usage and expiration of international prepaid minutes, net of chargebacks. Revenues from prepaid minutes are recognized as minutes are used;\n\u00b7\nAccess and wholesale charges \u2013 represent revenues generated from: (i) access fees charged to other telecommunication carriers or providers for Inter-exchange Carriers (\u201cIXC\u201d) calls terminated to our end-users, and (ii) fees charged to telecommunication carriers or providers for origination of calls to their 800-numbers. These revenues are recorded based on rates set forth in the respective state and federal tariffs or negotiated contract rates, less provisions for billing adjustments. Revenues from access and wholesale charges are recognized as minutes are used;\n\u00b7\nUCaaS \u2013 represents revenues recognized from: (i) recurring monthly service revenue from the sales of hosted services - customers are billed monthly in advance for these recurring services and in arrears for one time service charges and other certain usage charges, and (ii) non-recurring revenue from the sale of hardware and network equipment. Revenues for recurring monthly service are recorded in the period the services are provided over the term of the respective customer agreements and  revenue from the sale of hardware and network equipment is recognized in the period that the equipment is delivered; and\n\u00b7\nOther revenues \u2013 represent VoIP services provided to small to medium sized businesses through the SMB segment and revenues generated by ancillary\nrevenue sources\nComponents of Cost of Revenues\nOur cost of revenues is comprised of the following components.\n\u00b7\nCost of devices and related products \u2013 represent the costs of components and manufacturing of the magicJack devices, as well as production, packaging and other inventory-related costs and broker commissions on devices and mobile apps. The costs of the magicJack devices and mobile apps are recognized over the initial three, six or twelve month access right period.\nThe cost of battery powerbanks is expensed as incurred;\n\u00b7\nShipping and handling \u2013 represent freight, postage and other transportation costs related to: (i) transportation of the magicJack devices from the manufacturer to our warehouse and distribution center, and (ii) freight, shipping and handling fees incurred to ship the magicJack devices to retailers and direct customers. These costs are expensed as incurred;\n48\n\u00b7\nCredit card processing fees \u2013 represent transaction and other fees incurred as a result of accepting credit card payments for sales of magicJack devices, access right renewals, shipping and handling charges, magicJack related products and prepaid minutes sold direct to customers through our website. These fees are expensed as incurred;\n\u00b7\nNetwork and carrier charges \u2013 represent facilities charges to establish and maintain our network as well as network usage fee charges from other telecommunication carriers. These rates or charges are based upon commercial agreements or applicable state and\/or federal tariffs. These charges are expensed as incurred; and\n\u00b7\nUCaaS \u2013 represents the cost of providing the recurring monthly hosted services including, network usage charges, customer internet access, amortization expense and commissions as well as the cost of hardware and network equipment related to non-recurring sales, provided by our Broadsmart subsidiary. These costs are expensed as incurred; and\n\u00b7\nOther cost of revenues \u2013 represents allocation of personnel-related costs, amortization and depreciation expense related to assets employed in generating our revenues, as well as costs from discontinued revenue sources.\nYEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2016 COMPARED TO YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2015\nNet Revenues\nTotal net revenues were $97.4 million and $101.0 million for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively, representing a decrease of $3.6 million, or 3.5%. The decreases in the components of net revenues were primarily attributable to the following.\n\u00b7\n$7.2 million net decrease in access right renewal and mobile App revenues;\n\u00b7\n$2.6 million decrease in revenues from prepaid minutes resulting from lower usage levels;\n\u00b7\n$3.1 million decrease in magicJack device sales revenues, primarily reflecting lower retail sales volumes; and\n\u00b7\n$0.9 million decrease in revenues from access and wholesale charges.\nThese decreases in components of net revenues were partially offset by $9.0 million in sales related to Broadsmart UCaaS revenues and a $1.1 million increase in revenues from the sale of magicJack-related products.\nIn the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, sales of the magicJack devices through retail outlets represented approximately 52% and 67%, respectively, of sales of all magicJack devices sold. For the same periods, direct sales represented approximately 48% and 33%, respectively, of magicJack devices sold.\nFor the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, no retailer accounted for more than 10% of net revenues for the Core Consumer segment. For the year ended December 31, 2016, two customers accounted for 29% of net revenue for the Enterprise segment. Revenue for the SMB segment was not significant for the year ended December 31, 2016.\nCost of Revenues\nTotal cost of revenues was $36.7 million and $34.1 million for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively, representing an increase of approximately $2.6 million, or 7.6%. This increase in cost of revenues was primarily attributable to.\n\u00b7\n$7.2 million in Broadsmart UCaaS related cost of goods sold, which included approximately $2.1 million in depreciation and amortization expense related to acquired assets,\n\u00b7\na $0.5 million increase in shipping and handling costs reflecting an increase in direct sales volume, and\n\u00b7\na $0.4 million increase in the cost of devices and related products due to (a) a $0.8 million increase in broker commissions, primarily related to the mobile app sales, and (b) a $0.6 million increase in the cost of powerbanks, partially offset by a $1.0 million decrease in the cost of magicJack devices.\nThese increases in components of cost of revenues were partially offset by: (i) a $3.0 million decrease in network and carrier charges primarily as a result of lower traffic substantially resulting from\nthe elimination of free App users at the end of Q2 2016\n, (ii) $2.1 million decrease in other cost of revenues primarily attributable to a decrease in overhead allocation reflecting lower personnel related costs and amortization expense, and (iii) a $0.4 million decrease in credit card processing fees.\n49\nOperating Expenses\nTotal operating expenses were $46.9 million and $41.5 million for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively, representing an increase of $5.4 million, or 13.1%. This increase in operating expenses is primarily attributable to.\n\u00b7\na $6.8 million increase in G&A expense due to several factors including: (a) $6.1 million in costs associated with the SMB segment, (b) $3.1 million in costs associated with the Broadsmart UCaaS business, (c) $1.1 million in costs associated with our joint venture, and (c) $1.0 million impairment of intangible assets; partially offset by cost reductions in the Core Consumer segment totaling $4.5 million, primarily in the areas of personnel related costs and customer care related costs; and\n\u00b7\na $1.3 million increase in R&D expenses related to the new SMB segment, partially offset by cost reductions of $0.7 million in the Core Consumer segment.\nThese increases were partially offset by a $1.7 million gain on mark-to-market related to the Broadsmart Earnout Payment.\nThere was also a small net decrease of $0.3 million in consolidated marketing expense.  By segment, the changes were a $4.6 million decrease in the Core Consumer segment due to reduced media buys and personnel related costs, partially offset by the addition of: (a) $3.5 million in costs associated with the SMB segment, (b) $0.4 million in costs associated with the Enterprise segment (Broadsmart), and (c) $0.4 million in costs associated with the \u201cOther\u201d segment.\nOther Income (Expense)\nTotal other income (expense) was not significant for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015.\nIncome Taxes\nTotal income tax expense was $8.7 million and $11.8 million for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively. The calculation of our effective income tax rate for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015 is as follows (in thousands).\nYear Ended December 31,\n2016\n2015\nIncome before taxes\n$13,775\n$25,312\nIncome tax expense (benefit)\n8,719\n11,802\nEffective income tax rate\n63.30%\n46.63%\nWe primarily operate in the U.S. and Israel.  Our U.S. operations are subject to a federal statutory income tax rate of 34% in 2016 and  2015 and our Israeli operations are subject to a statutory income tax rate of 25.0% in 2016 and 26.5% in 2015. Our Israeli operations will be subject to a statutory income tax rate of 24.0% in 2017 and 23.0% in 2018. The income tax provision for 2016 and 2015 included items that have resulted in significant variances in our effective tax rate in comparison to statutory rates.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2016, we recorded an income tax expense of $8.7 million, which is higher than the expected tax provision of $4.7 million, using the statutory income tax rate of 34% due, in part, to the net impact of a decrease in the Israeli corporate tax rate from 26.5% to 23.0% which was effective in December 2016. The decrease in the rate resulted in the need to reduce our Israeli deferred tax assets, primarily net operating loss carryforwards, which resulted in deferred tax expense and a reduction in the value of related deferred tax assets of $5.2 million. Additionally, the effective tax rate was impacted by increases to uncertain tax positions of ($0.8 million), decreases in valuation allowances of ($1.2 million), and other items of $0.8 million. The items noted above were partially offset by the lower jurisdictional tax rate charged on the operating income of our Israeli operations.\nThe 2017 estimated annual effective tax rate is expected to approximate 35%, excluding discrete tax items, but may fluctuate during the year due to changes in our jurisdictional income and due to the timing of other discrete period transactions.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2015, we recorded income tax expense of $11.8 million, which differed from the expected provision of $8.6 million, using the statutory rate of 34%, primarily due to changes in valuation allowances of $1.3 million established against certain Israeli capital losses and state net operating loss carryforwards, increases to uncertain tax positions of $0.5 million, a decrease to deferred tax assets associated with expired stock options of $0.7 million, and other one-time discrete items of $0.7 million. State income tax (benefit), net of federal tax benefit, is presented in the effective tax rate reconciliation exclusive of changes in valuation allowances on state income tax deferred items.\nAs of December 31, 2016 and 2015, we had an income tax payable and prepaid income\ntaxes balance of\n$1.0 million and\n$2.7 million, respectively.\n50\nNoncontrolling Interest\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2016, we formed a new subsidiary and entered into a joint venture with an unrelated third party which resulted in a 60% controlling interest in the joint venture which began selling a line of high-technology residential consumer products in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2016. To date we have spent approximately $1.6 million funding the operations of this joint venture. The operations of the joint venture for the year ended December 31, 2016 have not been significant to our financial statements. Our consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2016, include an adjustment to income attributable to magicJack VocalTec Ltd. common shareholders of $635 thousand, to recognize the impact of the noncontrolling interest.  We have determined that the joint venture does not meet either the aggregation criteria to be combined with the existing Core Consumer segment or the quantitative thresholds to be treated as a separately reportable segment. As such, it is included in \u201cOther\u201d in our segment reconciliation. Refer to Note 16, \u201cSegment Reporting,\u201d in the Notes to our Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 herein for further details.\nNet Income Attributable to Common Shareholders and Income Per Share\nAs a result of the foregoing items, net income attributable to common shareholders decreased to $5.7 million in 2016 as compared to $13.5 million in 2015, primarily as a result of net losses of $11.0 million, $2.2 million and $1.6 million in the SMB, Enterprise and \u201cOther\u201d segments, respectively. The losses were partially offset by an increase in net income of $7.0 million from the Core Consumer segment and an adjustment of $0.6 million for the impact of the noncontrolling interest. Income per diluted share attributable to magicJack VocalTec Ltd. common shareholders decreased to $0.35 per common share in 2016 as compared to $0.79 per common share in 2015 due to the decrease in net income, partially offset by a decrease of approximately 1.0 million (or 5.8%) in the weighted average number of common shares outstanding in 2016 as compared to 2015 primarily due to our 2015 share repurchase program.\nYEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2015 COMPARED TO YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2014\nNet Revenues\nTotal net revenues were $101.0 million and $116.3 million for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively, representing a decrease of $15.4 million, or 13.2%. The decreases in the components of net revenues were primarily attributable to the following.\n\u00b7\na $8.7 million decrease in revenues recognized for the sale of magicJack devices, primarily as a result of lower unit volume on the sale of magicJack devices;\n\u00b7\na $1.3 million decrease in shipping and handling revenues primarily as a result\nof the reduction in unit sales mentioned above;\n\u00b7\na $2.7 million decrease in other magicJack related products reflecting lower unit sales on the device;\n\u00b7\na $1.8 million decrease in revenues from prepaid minutes primarily as a result of lower usage of prepaid minutes and;\n\u00b7\na $1.1 million decrease in access and wholesale charges primarily reflecting lower network traffic.\nThese decreases in components of net revenues were partially offset by a $0.2 million increase in access right renewals.\nIn the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, sales of the magicJack devices through retail outlets represented approximately 67% and 72%, respectively, of sales of all magicJack devices sold. For the same periods, direct sales represented approximately 33% and 28%, respectively, of magicJack devices sold.\nFor the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, no retailer accounted for more than 10% of our total net revenues.\nCost of Revenues\nTotal cost of revenues was $34.1 million and $42.5 million for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively, representing a decrease of $8.4 million, or 19.7%. This decrease in cost of revenues was primarily attributable to.\n\u00b7\na $3.8 million combined decrease in costs related to the magicJack devices, shipping and handling and credit card processing fees primarily reflecting lower unit sales of the magicJack device;\n\u00b7\na $4.3 million reduction in network and carrier charges reflecting lower network volume and continuing efforts to negotiate more favorable rates with other carriers and;\n\u00b7\na $0.3 million decrease in other cost of revenues primarily reflecting lower amortization expense on certain intangible assets.\n51\nOperating Expenses\nTotal operating expenses were $41.5 million and $60.2 million for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively, representing a decrease of $18.7 million, or 31.1%. This decrease in operating expenses was primarily due to.\n\u00b7\na $11.0 million decrease in marketing-related expense driven by (i) a $7.2 million decrease in advertising media buys reflecting management\u2019s decision not to spend significantly on media buys, (ii) a $1.2 million decrease in marketing related personnel costs driven by a decrease in head-count, and (iii) a $2.6 million decrease in sponsorships and other advertising spend reflecting a more conservative approach to our marketing spend in 2015;\n\u00b7\na $6.4 million decrease in general & administrative expenses primarily due to (i) approximately $5.0 million in lower legal and other professional expenses reflecting less litigation, and the settlement of certain regulatory and tax-related matters and other disputes, (ii) $1.7 million lower customer care related expenses, and (iii) $3.4 million in lower amortization expense and lower impairment charges related to the write-off of the $2.5 million net carrying value associated with a non-compete agreement with our founder and former CEO in 2014 with no comparable expense in 2015. These decreases were partially offset by a $3.1 increase in personnel related costs primarily reflecting severance expense and higher accrued bonus amounts year-over-year and;\n\u00b7\na $1.4 million decrease in research and development costs primarily reflecting lower personnel related expenses and a decrease in research and development related consulting costs.\nOur combined advertising-related expenses decreased by approximately 54% for the year ended December 31, 2015 as compared to December 31, 2014 primarily due to increased advertising efforts in the year ended December 31, 2014 related to the launch of the magicJack GO device and our new advertising campaign and brand refresh. During the year ended December 31, 2015, we reduced our advertising media buys. Advertising-related expenses have varied historically, and may continue to vary from quarter to quarter.\nOther Income (Expense)\nTotal other expense was not significant for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014.\nIncome Taxes\nTotal income tax expense was $11.8 million and $9.7 million for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively. The calculation of our effective tax rate for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014 was as follows (in thousands).\nYear Ended December 31,\n2015\n2014\nIncome before taxes\n$25,312\n$13,530\nIncome tax expense (benefit)\n11,802\n9,745\nEffective income tax rate\n46.63%\n72.03%\nWe primarily operate in the U.S. and Israel.  Our U.S. operations are subject to a federal statutory income tax rate of 34%, and our Israeli operations are subject to a statutory income tax rate of 26.5% in 2015 and 2014. The income tax provision for 2015 and 2014 included items that have resulted in significant variances in our effective tax rate in comparison to statutory rates.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2015, we recorded income tax expense of $11.8 million, which differed from the expected provision of $8.6 million, using the statutory rate of 34%, primarily due to changes in valuation allowances of $1.3 million established against certain Israeli capital losses and state net operating loss carryforwards, increases to uncertain tax positions of $0.5 million, a decrease to deferred tax assets associated with expired stock options of $0.7 million, and other one-time discrete items of $0.7 million. State income tax (benefit), net of federal tax benefit, is presented in the effective tax rate reconciliation exclusive of changes in valuation allowances on state income tax deferred items.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2014, we recorded income tax expense of $9.7 million, which differed from the expected tax provision of $5.0 million, using the statutory rate of 34%, primarily due to an increase in the U.S. uncertain tax positions of $6.4 million, as well as the effect of changes in the exchange rate on both our net deferred tax assets associated with our Israeli operations of $2.5 million, and taxable unrealized gains on the Israeli parent\u2019s U.S. dollar denominated assets of $6.4 million. These items were partially offset by an income tax benefit in our foreign taxes associated with expected revisions to jurisdictional income allocations resulting from the IRS audit examination of $5.3 million, and by the jurisdictional rate differential between the U.S. and Israel of $3.7 million and an adjustment of our estimate of the required valuation allowance of $1.2 million. Our Israeli operations resulted in an income tax provision of $5.2 million, an effective tax rate of 28.9%, and our domestic operations recorded a provision of $4.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2014.\n52\nAs of December 31, 2015 and 2014, we had a prepaid income\ntaxes balance of\n$2.7 million and\n$12.5 million, respectively, which was available to offset potential payments related to the uncertain tax liabilities disclosed above.\nNet Income Attributable to Ordinary Shareholders and Income Per Share\nAs a result of the foregoing items, net income attributable to ordinary shareholders increased to $13.5 million in 2015 as compared to $3.8 million in 2014. Income per diluted share attributable to ordinary shareholders increased to $0.79 per ordinary share in 2015 as compared to $0.21 per ordinary share in 2014 as a result of higher net operating income in 2015 as compared to 2014, and by a decrease of approximately 0.8 million (or 4.6%) in the weighted average number of ordinary shares outstanding in 2015 as compared to 2014 primarily due to our share repurchase program.\nLIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES\nOur primary sources of liquidity are cash generated from operations\n,\ncash on hand\n,\nand investments. As of December 31, 2016, we had cash and cash equivalents of $52.4 million, investments of $0.4 million and accounts receivables of $3.2 million. Accounts payable and income taxes payable at December 31, 2016, were $2.8 million and $1.4 million, respectively.  During the year ended Decemer 31, 2016 our cash decreased from $78.6 million as of December 31, 2015 to $52.4 million as of December 31, 2016, as we made two significant investments in our future to diversify our revenue sources and customer base. Those two investments were the $40.0 million acquisition of Broadsmart for our Enterprise segment in March 2016 and the year-long development of the SMB segment which resulted in a\nn\n$11.0 million investment.  These two initiatives are intended to diversify the Company\n\u2019s operations\nin light of the declining Core Consumer business centered on the magicJack devise and related products and services.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2016, we generated positive operating cash flows of $15.3 million, as compared to $25.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2015. The $10.1 million decrease was primarily attributable to the decrease in net income discussed above, most notably the $11.0 million investment in the new SMB segment. Net income was $5.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 as compared to a $13.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2015. We currently believe that available funds and cash flows generated by operations will be sufficient to fund our working capital and capital expenditure requirements for at least the next twelve months. If we decide to make future acquisitions, we may require new sources of funding, including additional debt, equity financing or some combination thereof. There can be no assurances that we will be able to secure additional sources of funding or that such additional sources of funding will be available on acceptable terms.\nCash Flow \u2013 Operating Activities\nNet cash provided by operating activities was $15.3 million, $25.4 million and $25.0 million for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2016, net cash provided by operating activities was primarily attributable to: (i) $5.1 million of net income; (ii) $12.7 million in non-cash items consisting primarily of (a) $4.2 million of share-based compensation expense, (b) $4.7 million of depreciation and amortization expense, (c) a $1.0 million impairment of intangible assets, (d) a $0.3 million increase in uncertain tax positions, and (e) a $4.4 million decrease in deferred income tax provision, partially offset by a $1.7 million gain on mark-to-market related to the Broadsmart Earnout Payment; (iii) a $1.6 million decrease in inventory levels; (iv) a $2.0 million decrease in prepaid income taxes; (v) a $1.5 million increase in accounts payable, and (vi) a $1.5 million increase in income taxes payable. These items were partially offset by: (i) a $10.2 million decrease in deferred revenue; (ii) a $1.0 million decrease in accrued expenses and other current liabilities; and (iii) a $0.4 million increase in deposits and other current assets.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2015, net cash provided by operating activities was primarily attributable to (i) $13.5 million net income, (ii) $20.1 million in net non-cash items consisting primarily of, $5.3 million in share-based compensation related primarily to ordinary share options and restricted stock units issued to executives, $3.6 million of depreciation and amortization expense, $12.9 million in deferred tax expense, $0.1 million in the provision for billing adjustments, and $0.1 million in non-cash interest, offset in part by a $1.8 million decrease in uncertain tax positions, (iii) $0.7 million decrease in deferred costs related to the magicJack device, (iv) a $3.1 million decrease in prepaid income taxes, (v) a $1.6 million increase in accrued bonus, and (vi) $0.9 million decrease in accounts receivable; offset in part by (i) $8.5 million decrease in deferred revenues primarily as a result of lower sales of magicJack devices, (ii) $0.1 million increase in inventories, (iii) $1.0 million increase in deposits and other current assets, (iv) $1.8 million decrease in accounts payable, (v) a $0.9 million decrease in income taxes payable and (vi) $2.3 million decrease in accrued expenses and other current liabilities.\n53\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2014, net cash provided by operating activities was primarily attributable to (i) $3.8 million net income, (ii) $24.8 million in net non-cash items consisting primarily of, $7.2 million in share-based compensation related primarily to ordinary share options and restricted stock units issued to executives, $14.2 million increase in uncertain tax positions, $4.8 million depreciation and amortization expense, $2.5 million in impairment of intangible assets, $0.4 million in the provision for billing adjustments, and $0.2 million in non-cash interest, offset in part by a $4.4 million deferred tax benefit, (iii) $1.9 million decrease in deferred costs related to the magicJack device, and (iv) $0.7 million increase in accounts payable; offset in part by (i) $3.3 million decrease in deferred revenues as a result of lower sales of magicJack devices, (ii) $1.1 million increase in inventories, (iii) $0.9 million increase in deposits and other current assets, (iv) $0.7 million increase in accounts receivable, and (v) $0.3 million decrease in accrued expenses and other current liabilities.\nCash Flow \u2013 Investing Activities\nNet cash (used in) provided by investing activities was ($41.0) million, $(1.0) million and $6.4 million for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively.\nNet cash used in investing activities during the year ended December 31, 2016 was primarily attributable to the acquisition of Broadsmart.\nNet cash used in investing activities during the year ended December 31, 2015 was attributable $1.0 million used for purchases of property and equipment.\nNet cash provided by investing activities during the year ended December 31, 2014 was primarily attributable to $9.1 million net proceeds from the sale of investments, partially offset by $2.2 million used for purchases of property and equipment, and $0.5 million used for acquisition of certain intangible assets.\nCash Flow \u2013Financing Activities\nNet cash used in financing activities was $0.4 million, $21.7 million and $1.5 million for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively.\nNo significant cash was (used in) or provided by financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2016.\nNet cash used in financing activities during the year ended December 31, 2015 primarily consisted of: (i) $20.0 million in cash used to purchase treasury stock as part of our share repurchase program, (ii) payment of $1.5 million for the last of five installment payments for the purchase of certain intangible assets in 2011, and (iii) $0.2 million in cash used to repurchase shares to settle executives\u2019 tax withholding liability upon the vesting of restricted stock units during the year.\nNet cash used in financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2014 consisted primarily of a payment of $1.5 million for the fourth of five installment payments for the purchase of certain intangible assets in 2011.\nStock Repurchase Program\nIn the first quarter of 2015, our Board of Directors authorized a stock repurchase program to enable us to purchase our ordinary shares at such times as management deemed appropriate up to a maximum cumulative repurchase authority of $20.0 million. The objective of our stock repurchase program was to improve stockholders\u2019 returns. As of December 31, 2015, we had expended the maximum authorized amount of $20.0 million for the acquisition of ordinary shares under the 2015 stock repurchase program. All shares purchased, and not yet retired, are recorded as treasury shares. We repurchased 2,329,003 ordinary shares under this program through December 31, 2015. We had no stock repurchase activity in the year ended December 31, 2016.\nOur Board of Directors had previously authorized a stock repurchase program to enable us to purchase our ordinary shares at such times as management deemed appropriate up to a maximum cumulative repurchase authority of $100.0 million. The objective of our stock repurchase program was to improve stockholders\u2019 returns. As of December 31, 2014, we had repurchased $91.3 million of ordinary shares under the previous stock repurchase program, and there was $8.7 million that remained authorized to purchase ordinary shares pursuant to the stock repurchase program. This program was terminated when our Board of Directors approved the new $20.0 million program in the first quarter of 2015. All shares purchased, and not yet retired, were recorded as treasury shares. There was no repurchase activity related to our previous stock repurchase program for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 or 2014. We repurchased 6,143,731 ordinary shares under this program through December 31, 2015.\n54\nWe have in the past bought call option contracts and sold put option contracts in connection with our share repurchase program in order to attempt to lower the average share price paid for ordinary shares it purchased.\nThere were no outstanding put option contracts at December 31, 2016 or 2015, and we do not expect to buy call options or sell common equity put options in the future as part of any share repurchase program.\nWe did not purchase any call option contacts or sell any put option contracts during the years ended December 31, 2016 or December 31, 2015.\nOther Liabilities\nAs of December 31, 2014, we had outstanding indebtedness in connection with an agreement entered during June 2011 for the purchase of certain intangible assets, and secured only by such intangible assets, under which it made a final non-interest bearing payment of $1.5 million on May 31, 2015. The liability for such payments was discounted at a rate of 10% to a net present value of $1.4 million at December 31, 2014.

MANAGEMENT\u2019S\nDISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF\nOPERATIONS\nYou should read the following discussion and analysis in\nconjunction with our financial statements, including the notes\nthereto contained in this Annual Report. This discussion contains\nforward-looking statements that involve risks, uncertainties and\nassumptions. Our actual results may differ materially from those\nanticipated in these forward-looking statements as a result of a\nvariety of certain factors, including those set forth under\n\u201cRisk Factors Associated with Our Business\u201d and\nelsewhere in this Annual Report.\nCritical Accounting Polices and Estimates\nThis Management's Discussion and Analysis of\nFinancial Condition and Results of Operations is based on our\nfinancial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with\naccounting principles generally accepted in the United States of\nAmerica (\u201c\nU.S. GAAP\n\u201d). The preparation of financial\nstatements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make\nestimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of\nassets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and\nliabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements\nand the reported amount of revenues and expenses during the\nreporting period. In our consolidated financial statements,\nestimates are used for, but not limited to, valuation of financial\ninstruments and intangible assets, fair value of long-lived assets\nand contingent consideration, deferred taxes and valuation\nallowance, and the depreciable lives of long-lived\nassets.\nOn\nan ongoing basis, we evaluate these estimates and assumptions,\nincluding those described below. We base our estimates on\nhistorical experience and on various other assumptions that we\nbelieve to be reasonable under the circumstances. These estimates\nand assumptions form the basis for making judgments about the\ncarrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily\napparent from other sources. Actual results could differ from\nthose estimates. Due to the estimation processes involved, the\nfollowing summarized accounting policies and their application are\nconsidered to be critical to understanding our business operations,\nfinancial condition and operating results.\nIntangible Assets\nOur\ndefinite-lived intangible assets have a carrying value of\napproximately $1,836,000 and $2,584,000, December 31, 2016 and\n2015, respectively. These assets include in-process research and\ndevelopment and license agreements. These intangible assets were\nrecorded at historical cost and are stated net of\naccumulated amortization.\nThe\nin-process research and development and licenses are amortized over\ntheir remaining estimated useful lives, ranging from 5 to\n12 years, based on the straight-line method. The estimated\nuseful lives directly impact the amount of amortization expense\nrecorded for these assets on a quarterly and annual\nbasis.\nIn\naddition, we test for impairment of definite-lived intangible\nassets when events or circumstances indicate that the carrying\nvalue of the assets may not be recoverable. Judgment is used in\ndetermining when these events and circumstances arise. If we\ndetermine that the carrying value of the assets may not be\nrecoverable, judgment and estimates are used to assess the fair\nvalue of the assets and to determine the amount of any impairment\nloss. No events or circumstances arose in the years ended\nDecember 31, 2016 and 2015 that would indicate that the carrying\nvalue of any of our definite-lived intangible assets may not be\nrecoverable.\nGoodwill\nGoodwill\nrelates to the acquisition of ProteaBio Europe during 2014 and\nrepresents the excess of the total purchase consideration over the\nfair value of acquired assets and assumed liabilities, using the\npurchase method of accounting. Goodwill is not amortized, but is\nsubject to periodic review for impairment. As a result, the amount\nof goodwill is directly impacted by the estimates of the fair\nvalues of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed.\nIn\naddition, goodwill will be reviewed annually, and whenever events\nor changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of\nthe goodwill might not be recoverable. Judgment is used in\ndetermining when these events and circumstances arise. We perform\nour review of goodwill on our one reporting unit. If we determine\nthat the carrying value of the assets may not be recoverable,\njudgment and estimates are used to assess the fair value of the\nassets and to determine the amount of any impairment\nloss.\n-31-\nTable of Contents\nThe\ncarrying value of goodwill at December 31, 2016 and 2015 was\napproximately $1,768,000 and $1,833,000, respectively.  If\nactual results are not consistent with our estimates or\nassumptions, we may be exposed to an impairment charge that could\nbe material.\nIncome Taxes\nWe\nuse the asset and liability method of accounting for income\ntaxes. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined\nbased on differences between the financial reporting and tax bases\nof assets and liabilities and are measured using the enacted tax\nrates and laws that are expected to be in effect when the\ndifferences are expected to reverse. The effect on deferred tax\nassets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in\nthe period that such tax rate changes are enacted. The measurement\nof a deferred tax asset is reduced, if necessary, by a valuation\nallowance if it is more likely than not that some portion or all of\nthe deferred tax asset will not be realized.\nWe\nuse a recognition threshold and a measurement attribute for\nthe financial statement recognition and measurement of tax\npositions taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. For those\nbenefits to be recognized, a tax position must be\nmore-likely-than-not to be sustained upon examination by taxing\nauthorities. We have not identified any uncertain income tax\npositions that could have a material impact to the consolidated\nfinancial statements. We are subject to taxation in various U.S.\nand foreign jurisdictions and remain subject to examination by\ntaxing jurisdictions for the calendar year 2013 and all subsequent\nperiods due to the availability of net operating loss\ncarryforwards. To the extent we prevail in matters for which a\nliability has been established, or are required to pay amounts in\nexcess of our established liability, our effective income tax rate\nin a given financial statement period could be materially affected.\nAn unfavorable tax settlement generally would require use of our\ncash and may result in an increase in our effective income tax rate\nin the period of resolution. A favorable tax settlement may reduce\nour effective income tax rate and would be recognized in the period\nof resolution.\nOur\neffective income tax rate may be affected by changes in tax\nlaw, our level of earnings, and the results of tax\naudits.\nAlthough\nwe believe that the judgments and estimates discussed herein are\nreasonable, actual results could differ, and we may be exposed to\nlosses or gains that could be material.\nJumpstart Our Business Startups Act of 2012\nOn\nApril 5, 2012, the JOBS Act was enacted. The JOBS Act provides\nthat an \u201cemerging growth company\u201d can take advantage of\nthe extended transition period provided in Section 7(a)(2)(B)\nof the Securities Act for complying with new or revised accounting\nstandards.\nGeneral\nTo date, we have not generated any revenues from\noperations and at December 31, 2016, we had an accumulated deficit\nof approximately $22,887,000, primarily as a result of research and\ndevelopment (\u201c\nR&D\n\u201d) expenses and general and administrative\n(\u201c\nG&A\n\u201d) expenses. While we may in the future\ngenerate revenue from a variety of sources, including license fees,\nresearch and development payments in connection with strategic\npartnerships and\/or government grants, our product candidates are\nat an early stage of development and may never be successfully\ndeveloped or commercialized. Accordingly, we expect to continue to\nincur substantial losses from operations for the foreseeable future\nand there can be no assurance that we will ever generate\nsignificant revenues or net income.\nR&D Expense\nConducting R&D\nis central to our business. R&D expense consists primarily\nof.\n\u25cf\nemployee-related\nexpense, which include salaries and benefits, and rent\nexpense;\n\u25cf\nlicense fees and\nannual payments related to in-licensed products and intellectual\nproperty;\n\u25cf\nexpenses incurred\nunder agreements with clinical research organizations,\ninvestigative sites and consultants that conduct or provide other\nservices relating to our clinical trials and a substantial portion\nof our preclinical activities;\n\u25cf\nthe\ncost of acquiring clinical trial materials from third party\nmanufacturers; and\n\u25cf\ncosts\nassociated with non-clinical activities, patent filings and\nregulatory filings.\n-32-\nTable of Contents\nDRAFT\nWe\nexpect to continue to incur substantial expense related to our\nR&D activities for the foreseeable future as we continue\nproduct development. Since product candidates in later stages of\nclinical development generally have higher development costs than\nthose in earlier stages of clinical development, primarily due to\nthe increased size and duration of later stage clinical trials, we\nexpect that our R&D expense will increase in the future. In\naddition, if our product development efforts are successful, we\nexpect to incur substantial costs to prepare for potential\ncommercialization of any late-stage product candidates and, in the\nevent one or more of these product candidates receive regulatory\napproval, to fund the launch of the product.\nG&A Expense\nG&A\nexpense consists principally of personnel-related costs,\nprofessional fees for legal, consulting and audit services, rent\nand other general operating expenses not otherwise included in\nR&D. We anticipate G&A expense will increase in future\nperiods, reflecting continued and increasing costs associated\nwith.\n\u25cf\nsupport of our\nexpanded R&D activities;\n\u25cf\nan\nexpanding infrastructure and increased professional fees and other\ncosts associated with the compliance with the Exchange Act, the\nSarbanes-Oxley Act and stock exchange regulatory requirements and\ncompliance; and\n\u25cf\nbusiness\ndevelopment and financing activities.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nWe have experienced net losses and negative cash\nflows from operations since our inception. As of December 31, 2016,\nwe had cash of approximately $1,774,000,\nworking capital of\napproximately $623,000, and had\nsustained cumulative losses attributable to common\nstockholders of approximately $22,887,000.\nWe believe that\nour cash on hand will sustain operations until July 2017. We are\ndependent on obtaining, and are continuing to pursue, the necessary\nfunding from outside sources, including obtaining additional\nfunding from the sale of securities in order to continue our\noperations. Without adequate funding, we may not be able to meet\nour obligations. We believe these conditions raise substantial\ndoubt about our ability to continue as a going concern through\nMarch 2018.\nWe have funded our operations to date primarily\nthrough the completion of the IPO and the issuance of debt and\nconvertible debt securities. The debt was issued through short-term\n8% convertible promissory notes and original issue discounted\nconvertible notes (the \u201c\nOID Notes\n\u201d).\nThrough\nDecember 31, 2016, we had received aggregate gross proceeds of\n$896,000 from the issuance of convertible promissory notes,\n$761,000 of which had been repaid, and $135,000 that was converted\ninto OID Notes on July 22, 2016. Payment of $33,790 of accrued\ninterest on the $761,000 principal amount of convertible promissory\nnotes repaid was made through the issuance of an aggregate of 5,242\nshares of common stock. In addition, through December 31, 2016, we\nhave received aggregate gross proceeds of $9,297,529 from the\nissuance of $10,128,836 principal amount of OID Notes.\nOn\nOctober 11, 2016, we completed the IPO, resulting in the issuance\nof 960,000 shares of common stock at an initial public offering\nprice of $5.50 per share and received gross proceeds of $5,280,000.\nWe incurred total expenses of approximately $1,774,000 in\nconnection with the IPO, resulting in net offering proceeds of\n$3,506,000.\nWe\nexpect to incur substantial expenditures in the foreseeable future\nfor the development of our product candidates. We will require\nadditional financing to develop, prepare regulatory filings and\nobtain regulatory approvals, fund operating losses, and, if deemed\nappropriate, establish manufacturing, sales and marketing\ncapabilities. Our current financial condition raises substantial\ndoubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. Our failure\nto raise capital as and when needed would have a material adverse\nimpact on our financial condition, our ability to meet our\nobligations, and our ability to pursue our business strategies. We\nwill seek funds through additional equity or debt financings,\ncollaborative or other arrangements with corporate sources, or\nthrough other sources of financing. Adequate additional funding may\nnot be available to us on acceptable terms or at all. If adequate\nfunds are not available to us, we will be required to delay,\ncurtail or eliminate one or more of our research and development\nprograms.\n-33-\nTable of Contents\nDRAFT\nWe\nare focused on expanding our product pipeline through\ncollaborations, and also through acquisitions of products and\ncompanies. We are continually evaluating potential asset\nacquisitions and business combinations. To finance such\nacquisitions, we might raise additional equity capital, incur\nadditional debt, or both.\nCash Flows for the Years Ended December 31, 2016 and\n2015\nNet\ncash used in operating activities for the year ended December 31,\n2016 was $4,534,859, which primarily reflected our net loss of\n$14,591,662 plus adjustments to reconcile net loss to net cash used\nin operating activities of depreciation and amortization expense of\n$734,500, fair value adjustment of the warrants liability of\n$2,329,019, fair value adjustment of the contingent consideration\nof ($300,000), restricted stock granted to employees and directors\nof $603,750, warrant expense to placement agents of $55,097,\nwarrant expense for lockup provisions of $2,741,003, accreted\ninterest on OID convertible debt of $1,160,267, a beneficial\nconversion feature of OID convertible debt of $1,108,194, and\naccreted interest on debt discount - warrants of $883,429. Changes\nin assets and liabilities are due to a decrease in other\nreceivables of $132,038 due primarily to the settling of amounts\nowed from an investor in the OID Notes and an increase in accounts\npayable and accrued expenses of $805,766 due to our cash position,\noffset by an increase in prepaid expenses of $229,411 due to the\naddition of prepaid Directors and Officers (\u201cD&O\u201d)\nliability insurance. Net cash used in operating activities for the\nyear ended December 31, 2015 was $4,170,254, which primarily\nreflected our net loss of $5,930,236 plus adjustments to reconcile\nnet loss to net cash used in operating activities of depreciation\nand amortization expense of $733,599, fair value gain on warrant\nliability of $386,103, accreted interest expense on OID convertible\ndebt of $749,262, accreted interest expense on debt discount -\nwarrants of $812,415, and warrant expense to placement agents of\n$218,337. Changes in assets and liabilities are due to an increase\nof accounts payable and accrued expenses of $251,608 due to our\nlimited cash position offset by an increase in other receivables of\n$638,092 due to a higher French R&D tax credit in 2015 versus\n2014.\nNet\ncash used in investing activities for the year ended December 31,\n2016 was $12,355 which consisted of the purchase of property and\nequipment. Net cash used in investing activities for the year ended\nDecember 31, 2015 was $24,380 consisting of purchases of property\nand equipment.\nNet\ncash provided by financing activities for the year ended December\n31, 2016 was $5,746,294, which consisted of $5,280,000 in gross\nproceeds from the sale of stock from our IPO, less $1,420,107 of\noffering costs paid in association with our IPO, $232,000 in\nproceeds from the issuance of notes payable from a financing\nagreement for our D&O insurance premiums less $76,813 in\nrepayment of these notes, and $2,094,000 in gross proceeds from the\nissuance of OID Notes offset by $362,786 in repayment of OID Notes.\nNet cash provided by financing activities for the year ended\nDecember 31, 2015 was $4,680,829 consisting of $340,524 of offering\ncosts paid in association with our IPO, gross proceeds of\n$5,395,000 in connection with the issuance of OID convertible debt,\nrepayments of OID convertible debt of $117,947, gross proceeds from\nthe issuance of promissory notes of $445,000, and the repayments of\npromissory notes of $701,000.\nConsolidated Results of Operations for the Years Ended December 31,\n2016 and 2015\nWe\nhave not yet achieved revenue-generating status from any of our\nproduct candidates or technologies. Since inception, we have\ndevoted substantially all of our time and efforts to developing our\nprincipal product candidates, consisting of AZX1101 and\nMS1819.  As a result, we did not have incur any revenue during\nthe years ended December 31, 2016 or 2015.\nR&D\nexpense was $2,496,105 for the year ended December 31, 2016, as\ncompared to $1,398,056 for the year ended December 31, 2015, an\nincrease of $1,098,049. The increase in R&D is primarily due to\ncosts associated with manufacturing additional batches of MS1819.\nWe expect R&D expense to increase in future periods as our\nproduct candidates continue through clinical trials and we seek\nstrategic collaborations.\nG&A\nexpense was $4,129,053 for the year ended December 31, 2016, as\ncompared to $3,330,752 for the year ended December 31, 2015, an\nincrease of $798,301. The increase was due primarily to non-cash\nrestricted stock granted to employees and directors of $603,750 and\nincreased expenses such as auditing, D&O insurance, and\ndirectors fees due to being a public company. We expect G&A\nexpense to increase going forward as we proceed to advance our\nproduct candidates through the development and regulatory\nprocess.\n-34-\nTable of Contents\nDRAFT\nFair\nvalue adjustment of our contingent consideration decreased $300,000\nfor the year ended December 31, 2016 due primarily to revised net\nsales projections, slight adjustments to the risk of realizing\nthose projections, and the time value of money. No such fair value\nadjustment of our consideration was recorded in the year ended\nDecember 31, 2015.\nInterest\nexpense for the year ended December 31, 2016 was $5,937,486 as\ncompared to $1,587,533 for the year ended December 31, 2015. The\nincrease is due to the higher level of outstanding OID Notes as\nwell as a beneficial conversion feature of the OID Notes at the\ndate of the IPO recorded as an interest expense of the OID Notes\nand the issuance of additional warrants issued for 6-month lockup\nprovisions on the common stock received from the conversion of OID\nDebt at the date of the IPO recorded as interest expense. Fair\nvalue adjustment of our warrants was $2,329,018 and ($386,103),\nrespectively, for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, an\nincrease of $2,715,121. The increase was due to the warrants having\na greater value at the date of the IPO compared to December 31,\n2015.\nNet\nloss was $14,591,662 and $5,930,236, respectively, for the years\nended December 31, 2016 and 2015, an increase of $8,661,426. The\nhigher net loss for the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to\nthe same period in 2015 is due to the higher expenses noted\nabove.\nOff-Balance Sheet Items\nThe\nfollowing table summarizes our contractual obligations over the\nperiods indicated, as well as our total contractual\nobligations.\nContractual\nObligation\nTotal\n2017\n2018\n2019\n2020\n2021\nOperating\nLeases\n$320,854\n$106,450\n$71,468\n$71,468\n$71,468\n$-","45":"","46":"ITEM 7.\nMANAGEMENT\n\u2019\nS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND\nRESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nThe following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read together with the selected consolidated financial data and our consolidated financial statements and the related notes appe\naring elsewhere in this report.\nThis discussion and analysis contains forward-looking statements that involve risks,\nuncertainties and assumptions.\nOur actual results may differ materially from those anticipated in these forward-looking statements as\na result of many factors, including but not limited to those under the heading \u201cRisk Factors\u201d beginning on\npage 7. We\ndo not assume, and specifically disclaim, any obligation to update any forward-looking statement contained in this\nreport.\nOverview\nThe primary source of our operating revenue is provided by our Truckload segment through a combination of regional short-haul and medium-to-long-haul full-load transportation services. We transport food and other consumer packaged goods that require a temperature-controlled or insulated environment, along with dry freight, across the United States and into and out of Mexico and Canada.\nOur Dedicated segment provides customized transportation solutions tailored to meet individual customers\u2019 requirements, utilizing temperature-controlled trailers, dry vans and other specialized equipment within the United States. Our customer contracts range from three to five years and are subject to annual rate reviews.\nGenerally, we are paid by the mile for our Truckload and Dedicated services. We also derive Truckload and Dedicated revenue from fuel surcharges, loading and unloading activities, equipment detention and other ancillary services. The main factors that affect our Truckload and Dedicated revenue are the rate per mile we receive from our customers, the percentage of miles for which we are compensated, the number of miles we generate with our equipment and changes in fuel prices. We monitor our revenue production primarily through average Truckload and Dedicated revenue, net of fuel surcharges, per tractor per week. We also analyze our average Truckload and Dedicated revenue, net of fuel surcharges, per total mile, non-revenue miles percentage, the miles per tractor we generate, our fuel surcharge revenue, our accessorial revenue and our other sources of operating revenue.\nOur Intermodal segment transports our customers\u2019 freight within the United States primarily utilizing our temperature-controlled trailers and also, through March 2015, our dry containers on railroad flatcars for portions of trips, with the balance of the trips using our tractors or, to a lesser extent, contracted carriers. The main factors that affect our Intermodal revenue are the rate per mile and other charges we receive from our customers.\nOur Brokerage segment develops contractual relationships with and arranges for third-party carriers to transport freight for our customers in temperature-controlled trailers and dry vans within the United States and into and out of Mexico through Marten Transport Logistics, LLC, which was established in 2007 and operates pursuant to brokerage authority granted by the DOT. We retain the billing, collection and customer management responsibilities. The main factors that affect our Brokerage revenue are the rate per mile and other charges that we receive from our customers.\nIn addition to the factors discussed above, our operating revenue is also affected by, among other things, the United States economy, inventory levels, the level of truck and rail capacity in the transportation market, a contracting driver market, severe weather conditions and specific customer demand.\n18\nOur operating revenue increased $6.2 million, or 0.9%, in 2016, despite a 26.4% decrease in fuel surcharge revenue to $53.2 million from $72.3 million in 2015 due to lower fuel prices. Our operating revenue, net of both fuel surcharges and revenue from our dry container service discontinued in March 2015, increased $26.6 million, or 4.5%, compared with 2015. Truckload segment revenue, net of fuel surcharges, decreased 2.3% from 2015 primarily due to a decrease in our average revenue per tractor. Dedicated segment revenue, net of fuel surcharges, increased 37.1% primarily due to an increase in our average fleet size of 36.7% from 2015. Intermodal segment revenue, net of both fuel surcharges and revenue from our discontinued dry container service, decreased $49,000 from 2015 due to a decrease in volume. Brokerage segment revenue decreased 7.0% in 2016 due to a decrease in revenue per load, primarily caused by lower fuel surcharges.\nOur profitability is impacted by the variable costs of transporting freight for our customers, fixed costs, and expenses containing both fixed and variable components. The variable costs include fuel expense, driver-related expenses, such as wages, benefits, training, and recruitment, and independent contractor costs, which are recorded under purchased transportation. Expenses that have both fixed and variable components include maintenance and tire expense and our cost of insurance and claims. These expenses generally vary with the miles we travel, but also have a controllable component based on safety, fleet age, efficiency and other factors. Our main fixed costs relate to the acquisition and subsequent depreciation of long-term assets, such as revenue equipment and operating terminals. We expect our annual cost of tractor and trailer ownership will increase in future periods as a result of higher prices of new equipment, along with any increases in fleet size. Although certain factors affecting our expenses are beyond our control, we monitor them closely and attempt to anticipate changes in these factors in managing our business. For example, fuel prices have significantly fluctuated over the past several years. We manage our exposure to changes in fuel prices primarily through fuel surcharge programs with our customers, as well as through volume fuel purchasing arrangements with national fuel centers and bulk purchases of fuel at our terminals. To help further reduce fuel expense, we have installed and tightly manage the use of auxiliary power units in our tractors to provide climate control and electrical power for our drivers without idling the tractor engine, and also have improved the fuel usage in the temperature-control units on our trailers. For our Intermodal and Brokerage segments, our profitability is impacted by the percentage of revenue which is payable to the providers of the transportation services we arrange. This expense is included within purchased transportation in our consolidated statements of operations.\nOur operating expenses as a percentage of operating revenue, or \u201coperating ratio,\u201d increased to 91.3% in 2016 from 90.8% in 2015. Operating expenses as a percentage of operating revenue, with both amounts net of fuel surcharges, was 90.6% in 2016. Our operating ratio for 2015, net of both the facility disposition gain of $4.1 million and fuel surcharges, was 90.4%. Our net income was $33.5 million, or $1.02 per diluted share, in 2016 and $35.7 million, or $1.06 per diluted share, in 2015. Net income in 2016 improved 0.4% over earnings of $33.3 million, or $0.99 per diluted share, in 2015 excluding the facility disposition gain, due to increased operating income in our Dedicated, Intermodal and Brokerage segments, partially offset by decreased operating income in our Truckload segment.\nOur business requires substantial, ongoing capital investments, particularly for new tractors and trailers. At December 31, 2016, we had $7.9 million of long-term debt outstanding and $437.3 million in stockholders\u2019 equity. In 2016, net cash flows provided by operating activities of $133.6 million were primarily used to purchase new revenue equipment, net of proceeds from dispositions, in the amount of $89.9 million, to partially construct regional operating facilities in the amount of $5.1 million, to repay, net of borrowings, $30.0 million of long-term debt, to repurchase and retire 455,581 shares of our common stock for $7.5\nmillion, and to pay cash dividends of $3.3 million. We estimate that capital expenditures, net of proceeds from dispositions, will be approximately $88 million in 2017. We believe our sources of liquidity are adequate to meet our current and anticipated needs for at least the next twelve months. Based upon anticipated cash flows, existing cash and cash equivalents balances, current borrowing availability and other sources of financing we expect to be available to us, we do not anticipate any significant liquidity constraints in the foreseeable future.\n19\nOur business strategy encompasses a multifaceted set of transportation service solutions, primarily regional Truckload temperature-controlled operations along with Dedicated, Intermodal and Brokerage services, with a diverse customer base that gains value from and expands each of these operating segments. We believe that we are well-positioned regardless of the economic environment with the services we provide combined with our competitive position, cost control emphasis, modern fleet and strong balance sheet.\nThis Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations includes discussions of operating revenue, net of fuel surcharge revenue; Truckload, Dedicated and Intermodal revenue, net of fuel surcharge revenue; operating revenue and Intermodal revenue, each net of fuel surcharge revenue and revenue from our dry container service discontinued in March 2015; operating expenses as a percentage of operating revenue, each net of fuel surcharge revenue and the sum of fuel surcharge revenue and the facility disposition gain; and net fuel expense (fuel and fuel taxes net of fuel surcharge revenue and surcharges passed through to independent contractors, outside drayage carriers and railroads). We provide these additional disclosures because management believes these measures provide a more consistent basis for comparing results of operations from period to period. These financial measures in this report have not been determined in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP). Pursuant to Item 10(e) of Regulation S-K, we have included the amounts necessary to reconcile these non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures of operating revenue, operating expenses divided by operating revenue, and fuel and fuel taxes.\nResults of Operations\nThe following table sets forth for the years indicated certain operating statistics regarding our revenue and operations.\n20\n16\n2015\n2014\nTruckload Segment.\nRevenue (in thousands)\n$375,851\n$398,361\n$448,273\nAverage revenue, net of fuel surcharges,\nper tractor per week\n(1)\n$3,427\n$3,529\n$3,618\nAverage tractors\n(1)\n1,898\n1,892\n1,900\nAverage miles per trip\n623\n666\n682\nTotal miles (in thousands)\n184,281\n186,268\n199,168\nDedicated Segment.\nRevenue (in thousands)\n$157,370\n$118,272\n$70,352\nAverage revenue, net of fuel surcharges,\nper tractor per week\n(1)\n$3,432\n$3,433\n$3,322\nAverage tractors\n(1)\n819\n599\n327\nAverage miles per trip\n301\n347\n337\nTotal miles (in thousands)\n75,333\n57,381\n31,543\nIntermodal Segment.\nRevenue (in thousands)\n$71,490\n$76,958\n$97,092\nLoads\n35,947\n36,404\n44,336\nAverage tractors\n76\n89\n110\nBrokerage Segment.\nRevenue (in thousands)\n$66,433\n$71,403\n$57,212\nLoads\n49,721\n48,060\n36,712\n(1)\nIncludes tractors driven by both company-employed drivers and independent contractors.

Our operating revenue, net of both fuel surcharges and revenue from our dry container service discontinued in March 2015, increased $26.6 million, or 4.5%, to $617.9 million in 2016 from $591.3 million in 2015. This increase was due to a $39.7 million increase in Dedicated revenue, net of fuel surcharges, partially offset by an $8.1 million decrease in Truckload revenue, net of fuel surcharges, a $5.0 million decrease in Brokerage revenue, and a $49,000 decrease in Intermodal revenue, net of both fuel surcharges and the discontinued dry container service.\nTruckload segment revenue decreased $22.5 million, or 5.7%, to $375.9 million in 2016 from $398.4 million in 2015. Truckload segment revenue, net of fuel surcharges, decreased $8.1 million, or 2.3%, to $340.0 million in 2016 from $348.1 million in 2015, primarily due to a decrease in our average revenue per tractor. The increase in the operating ratio in 2016 was also primarily due to a decrease in our average revenue per tractor within a continued soft freight market.\nDedicated segment revenue increased $39.1 million, or 33.1%, to $157.4 million in 2016 from $118.3 million in 2015. Dedicated segment revenue, net of fuel surcharges, increased 37.1% primarily due to an increase in our average fleet size of 36.7% driven by a significant increase in the number of Dedicated contracts we have with customers. The improvement in the operating ratio in 2016 was achieved primarily through multiple cost control measures.\nIntermodal segment revenue decreased $5.5 million, or 7.1%, to $71.5 million in 2016 from $77.0 million in 2015. Intermodal segment revenue, net of both fuel surcharges and $1.3 million of revenue from our discontinued dry container service, decreased $49,000 from 2015 due to a decrease in volume. The improvement in the operating ratio in 2016 was primarily due to the disposal of our dry container service, which produced a higher operating ratio than our temperature-controlled trailer service, and decreases in salaries, wages and benefits and depreciation expense, as the fleet size was reduced to optimize productivity.\nBrokerage segment revenue decreased $5.0 million, or 7.0%, to $66.4 million in 2016 from $71.4 million in 2015, due to a decrease in revenue per load, primarily caused by lower fuel surcharges. The improvement in the operating ratio in 2016 was primarily driven by a decrease in the percentage of the amounts payable to carriers for transportation services which we arranged to our Brokerage revenue.\n22\nThe following table sets forth for the years indicated the dollar and percentage increase or decrease of the items in our consolidated statements of operations, and those items as a percentage of operating revenue.\nDollar\nChange\nPercentage\nChange\nPercentage of\nOperating Revenue\n(Dollars in thousands)\n2016 vs. 2015\n2016 vs. 2015\n2016\n2015\nOperating revenue\n$6,150\n0.9%\n100.0%\n100.0%\nOperating expenses (income).\nSalaries, wages and benefits\n15,372\n7.3\n33.5\n31.5\nPurchased transportation\n(7,311\n)\n(6.2\n)\n16.5\n17.7\nFuel and fuel taxes\n(10,507\n)\n(10.0\n)\n14.0\n15.7\nSupplies and maintenance\n593\n1.4\n6.5\n6.5\nDepreciation\n7,122\n9.5\n12.3\n11.3\nOperating taxes and licenses\n185\n2.1\n1.4\n1.3\nInsurance and claims\n2,971\n10.2\n4.8\n4.4\nCommunications and utilities\n401\n6.8\n0.9\n0.9\nGain on disposition of\nrevenue equipment\n(4,918\n)\n(88.1\n)\n(1.6\n)\n(0.8\n)\nGain on disposition of facilities\n4,104\n(100.0\n)\n-\n(0.6\n)\nOther\n898\n4.8\n2.9\n2.8\nTotal operating expenses\n8,910\n1.5\n91.3\n90.8\nOperating income\n(2,760\n)\n(4.5\n)\n8.7\n9.2\nOther\n865\n232.5\n0.2\n0.1\nIncome before income taxes\n(3,625\n)\n(6.0\n)\n8.5\n9.1\nProvision for income taxes\n(1,344\n)\n(5.4\n)\n3.5\n3.8\nNet income\n$(2,281\n)\n(6.4\n)%\n5.0%\n5.4%\nSalaries, wages and benefits consist of compensation for our employees, including both driver and non-driver employees, employees\u2019 health insurance, 401(k) plan contributions and other fringe benefits. These expenses vary depending upon the size of our Truckload, Dedicated and Intermodal tractor fleets, the ratio of company drivers to independent contractors, our efficiency, our experience with employees\u2019 health insurance claims, changes in health care premiums and other factors. Salaries, wages and benefits expense increased $15.4 million, or 7.3%, in 2016 from 2015. The increase in salaries, wages and benefits from 2015 resulted primarily from a 6.3% increase in the total miles driven by company drivers and increases to several components of the amount paid to company drivers, along with an increase in employees\u2019 health insurance expense of $1.8 million due to an increase in our self-insured medical claims, partially offset by a decrease of $960,000 in bonus compensation expense for our non-driver employees.\n23\nPurchased transportation consists of amounts payable to railroads and carriers for transportation services we arrange in connection with Brokerage and Intermodal operations and to independent contractor providers of revenue equipment. This category will vary depending upon the amount and rates, including fuel surcharges, we pay to third-party railroad and motor carriers, the ratio of company drivers versus independent contractors and the amount of fuel surcharges passed through to independent contractors. Purchased transportation expense decreased $7.3 million in total, or 6.2%, in 2016 from 2015. Amounts payable to carriers for transportation services we arranged in our Brokerage segment decreased $5.1 million to $55.4 million in 2016 from $60.5 million in 2015, primarily due to a decrease in brokerage revenue. Amounts payable to railroads and drayage carriers for transportation services within our Intermodal segment decreased $3.4 million to $45.9 million in 2016 from $49.3 million in 2015. This decrease was primarily due to decreased revenue within our temperature-controlled intermodal trailer service, along with the disposal in March 2015 of the dry containers that were used in a portion of our intermodal operations. The portion of purchased transportation expense related to our independent contractors within our Truckload and Dedicated segments, including fuel surcharges, increased $1.2 million in 2016. We expect that purchased transportation expense will increase as we grow our Intermodal and Brokerage segments.\nFuel and fuel taxes decreased by $10.5 million, or 10.0%, in 2016 from 2015. Net fuel expense (fuel and fuel taxes net of fuel surcharge revenue and surcharges passed through to independent contractors, outside drayage carriers and railroads) increased $5.9 million, or 14.4%, to $47.0 million in 2016 from $41.1 million in 2015. Fuel surcharges passed through to independent contractors, outside drayage carriers and railroads decreased to $6.2 million from $8.9 million in 2015. Despite a decrease in the DOE national average cost of fuel to $2.30 per gallon from $2.71 per gallon in 2015, net fuel expense increased to 8.5% of Truckload, Dedicated and Intermodal segment revenue, net of fuel surcharges, from 7.9% in 2015. The net fuel expense to revenue increased in 2016 primarily due to our discount from retail being larger in 2015 as the result of a significant decrease in fuel prices during the first quarter, compared with level fuel prices in the first quarter of 2016. The discount from retail typically increases when prices decrease. We have worked diligently to control fuel usage and costs by improving our volume purchasing arrangements and optimizing our drivers\u2019 fuel purchases with national fuel centers, focusing on shorter lengths of haul, installing and tightly managing the use of auxiliary power units in our tractors to minimize engine idling and improving fuel usage in the temperature-control units on our trailers. Auxiliary power units, which we have installed in our company-owned tractors, provide climate control and electrical power for our drivers without idling the tractor engine.\nDepreciation relates to owned tractors, trailers, auxiliary power units, communication units, terminal facilities and other assets. The increase in depreciation was primarily due to a continued increase in the cost of revenue equipment and growth of our fleet. We expect our annual cost of tractor and trailer ownership will increase in future periods as a result of higher prices of new equipment, which will result in greater depreciation over the useful life.\nInsurance and claims consist of the costs of insurance premiums and accruals we make for claims within our self-insured retention amounts, primarily for personal injury, property damage, physical damage to our equipment, cargo claims and workers\u2019 compensation claims. These expenses will vary primarily based upon the frequency and severity of our accident experience, our self-insured retention levels and the market for insurance. The $3.0 million increase in insurance and claims in 2016 was primarily due to increases in self-insured auto liability claims and auto liability insurance premiums. Our significant self-insured retention exposes us to the possibility of significant fluctuations in claims expense between periods which could materially impact our financial results depending on the frequency, severity and timing of claims.\nGain on disposition of revenue equipment increased to $10.5 million in 2016 from $5.6 million in 2015 primarily due to an increase in both the average gain per tractor and in the number of tractors sold. We expect our gain on disposition of revenue equipment to decrease to approximately $3 million in 2017. Future gains or losses on dispositions of revenue equipment will be impacted by the market for used revenue equipment, which is beyond our control.\n24\nGain on disposition of facilities was $4.1 million in 2015. The disposition of the facilities, located in Ontario, CA and Indianapolis, IN, was part of our ongoing program to expand and update the footprint of our facilities throughout the United States, in which we have spent $89 million since 2009. Any future gains or losses on disposition of facilities will be impacted by the market for real estate, which is beyond our control.\nAs a result of the foregoing factors, our operating expenses as a percentage of operating revenue, or \u201coperating ratio,\u201d was 91.3% in 2016 and 90.8% in 2015\n. The operating ratio for our Truckload segment was 92.7% in 2016 and 91.1% in 2015, for our Dedicated segment was 87.6% in 2016 and 89.2% in 2015, for our Intermodal segment was 90.0% in 2016 and 93.7% in 2015, and for our Brokerage segment was 93.7% in 2016 and 94.7% in 2015. Operating expenses as a percentage of operating revenue, with both amounts net of fuel surcharges, was 90.6% in 2016\n. Our operating ratio for 2015, net of both the gain on disposition of facilities and fuel surcharges, was 90.4%.\nThe increase in our non-operating expense was primarily due to increased losses in 2016 by MW Logistics, LLC, or MWL, a 45% owned affiliate.\nOur effective income tax rate increased slightly to 41.4% in 2016 from 41.1% in 2015.\nAs a result of the factors described above, net income was $33.5 million in 2016 and $35.7 million in 2015. Net earnings per diluted share was $1.02 in 2016 and $1.06 in 2015\n. Net income in 2016 improved 0.4% over earnings of $33.3 million, or $0.99 per diluted share, in 2015 excluding the gain on disposition of facilities.\n25\nComparison of Year Ended December 31, 2015 to Year Ended December 31, 2014\nThe following table sets forth for the years indicated our operating revenue, operating income and operating ratio by segment, along with the change for each component.\nDollar\nChange\nPercentage\nChange\n(Dollars in thousands)\n2015\n2014\n2015 vs. 2014\n2015 vs. 2014\nOperating revenue.\nTruckload revenue, net of fuel\nsurcharge revenue\n$348,101\n$358,458\n$(10,357\n)\n(2.9\n)%\nTruckload fuel surcharge revenue\n50,260\n89,815\n(39,555\n)\n(44.0\n)\nTotal Truckload revenue\n398,361\n448,273\n(49,912\n)\n(11.1\n)\nDedicated revenue, net of fuel\nsurcharge revenue\n107,264\n56,609\n50,655\n89.5\nDedicated fuel surcharge revenue\n11,008\n13,743\n(2,735\n)\n(19.9\n)\nTotal Dedicated revenue\n118,272\n70,352\n47,920\n68.1\nIntermodal revenue, net of fuel\nsurcharge revenue\n65,877\n75,447\n(9,570\n)\n(12.7\n)\nIntermodal fuel surcharge revenue\n11,081\n21,645\n(10,564\n)\n(48.8\n)\nTotal Intermodal revenue\n76,958\n97,092\n(20,134\n)\n(20.7\n)\nBrokerage revenue\n71,403\n57,212\n14,191\n24.8\nTotal operating revenue\n$664,994\n$672,929\n$(7,935\n)\n(1.2\n)%\nOperating income.\nTruckload\n$35,517\n$39,483\n$(3,966\n)\n(10.0\n)%\nDedicated\n12,818\n7,136\n5,682\n79.6\nIntermodal\n4,832\n1,735\n3,097\n178.5\nBrokerage\n3,792\n2,652\n1,140\n43.0\nTotal operating income before gain\non disposition of facilities\n56,959\n51,006\n5,953\n11.7\nGain on disposition of facilities\n4,104\n-\n4,104\nN\/A\nTotal operating income\n$61,063\n$51,006\n$10,057\n19.7%\nOperating ratio\n(1\n)\n.\nTruckload\n91.1%\n91.2%\nDedicated\n89.2\n89.9\nIntermodal\n93.7\n98.2\nBrokerage\n94.7\n95.4\nConsolidated operating ratio before\ngain on disposition of facilities\n91.4%\n92.4%\nConsolidated operating ratio\n90.8%\n92.4%\n(1)\nRepresents operating expenses as a percentage of operating revenue.\n26\nOur operating revenue decreased $7.9 million, or 1.2%, to $665.0 million in 2015 from $672.9 million in 2014, reflecting a 42.2% decrease in fuel surcharge revenue to $72.3 million from $125.2 million in 2014 due to lower fuel prices. Our operating revenue, net of fuel surcharges, increased $44.9 million, or 8.2%, to $592.6 million in 2015 from $547.7 million in 2014. This increase was due to a $50.7 million increase in Dedicated revenue, net of fuel surcharges, and a $14.2 million increase in Brokerage revenue, partially offset by a $10.4 million decrease in Truckload revenue, net of fuel surcharges, and a $9.6 million decrease in Intermodal revenue, net of fuel surcharges.\nTruckload segment revenue decreased $49.9 million, or 11.1%, to $398.4 million in 2015 from $448.3 million in 2014. Truckload segment revenue, net of fuel surcharges, decreased $10.4 million, or 2.9%, to $348.1 million in 2015 from $358.5 million in 2014. The slight improvement in the operating ratio in 2015 was primarily due to an improvement in our net fuel expense with the lower fuel prices and the negative impact of severe weather conditions in the first quarter of 2014 on both freight volumes and operating costs, partially offset by a decrease in our average revenue per tractor within a soft freight market since the second quarter of 2015.\nDedicated segment revenue increased $47.9 million, or 68.1%, to $118.3 million in 2015 from $70.4 million in 2015. Dedicated segment revenue, net of fuel surcharges, increased 89.5% primarily due to an increase in our average fleet size of 83.2% driven by a significant increase in our number of Dedicated contracts with customers. The improvement in the operating ratio in 2015 was primarily due to an increase in our average revenue per tractor.\nIntermodal segment revenue decreased $20.1 million, or 20.7%, to $77.0 million in 2015 from $97.1 million in 2014. Intermodal segment revenue, net of fuel surcharges, decreased 12.7% due to the disposal in March 2015 of the dry containers that were used in a portion of our intermodal operations, partially offset by increased volume with our temperature-controlled intermodal trailer service. The improvement in the operating ratio in 2015 was primarily due to costs associated with rail service interruption and delay issues in 2014 that constrained our intermodal operations, the disposal of our dry container service, which produced a higher operating ratio than our temperature-controlled trailer service, rate increases beginning in the fourth quarter of 2014, and the negative impact of severe weather conditions in the first quarter of 2014 on both freight volumes and operating costs.\nBrokerage segment revenue increased $14.2 million, or 24.8%, to $71.4 million in 2015 from $57.2 million in 2014, primarily due to an increase in volume. The improvement in the operating ratio in 2015 was primarily due to a decrease in the payments to carriers for transportation services which we arranged as a percentage of our Brokerage revenue.\n27\nThe following table sets forth for the years indicated the dollar and percentage increase or decrease of the items in our consolidated statements of operations, and those items as a percentage of operating revenue.\nDollar\nChange\nPercentage\nChange\nPercentage of\nOperating Revenue\n(Dollars in thousands)\n2015 vs. 2014\n2015 vs. 2014\n2015\n2014\nOperating revenue\n$(7,935\n)\n(1.2\n)%\n100.0%\n100.0%\nOperating expenses (income).\nSalaries, wages and benefits\n25,991\n14.2\n31.5\n27.3\nPurchased transportation\n(4,987\n)\n(4.1\n)\n17.7\n18.3\nFuel and fuel taxes\n(49,349\n)\n(32.1\n)\n15.7\n22.9\nSupplies and maintenance\n1,829\n4.4\n6.5\n6.2\nDepreciation\n7,080\n10.4\n11.3\n10.1\nOperating taxes and licenses\n1,774\n24.8\n1.3\n1.1\nInsurance and claims\n2,012\n7.4\n4.4\n4.0\nCommunications and utilities\n88\n1.5\n0.9\n0.9\nGain on disposition of revenue equipment\n(1,197\n)\n(27.3\n)\n(0.8\n)\n(0.7\n)\nGain on disposition of facilities\n(4,104\n)\nN\/A\n(0.6\n)\n-\nOther\n2,871\n18.0\n2.8\n2.4\nTotal operating expenses\n(17,992\n)\n(2.9\n)\n90.8\n92.4\nOperating income\n10,057\n19.7\n9.2\n7.6\nOther\n1,039\n155.8\n0.1\n(0.1\n)\nIncome before income taxes\n9,018\n17.5\n9.1\n7.7\nProvision for income taxes\n3,107\n14.2\n3.8\n3.2\nNet income\n$5,911\n19.8%\n5.4%\n4.4%\nSalaries, wages and benefits expense increased $26.0 million, or 14.2%, in 2015 from 2014. The increase in salaries, wages and benefits from 2014 resulted primarily from a 5.2% increase in the total miles driven by company drivers and increases to several components of the amount paid to company drivers. Employees\u2019 health insurance costs increased $2.1 million due to higher self-insured medical claims and bonus compensation expense for our non-driver employees increased $1.0 million as well.\nPurchased transportation expense decreased $5.0 million in total, or 4.1%, in 2015 from 2014. Payments to carriers for transportation services we arranged in our Brokerage segment increased $11.4 million to $60.5 million in 2015 from $49.1 million in 2014, primarily due to an increase in volume. Payments to railroads and drayage carriers for transportation services within our Intermodal segment decreased $17.1 million to $49.3 million in 2015 from $66.4 million in 2014. This decrease was due to the disposal in March 2015 of the dry containers that were used in a portion of our intermodal operations, partially offset by increased volume with our temperature-controlled intermodal trailer service. The portion of purchased transportation expense related to our independent contractors within our Truckload and Dedicated segments, including fuel surcharges, increased $704,000 in 2015.\n28\nFuel and fuel taxes decreased by $49.3 million, or 32.1%, in 2015 from 2014. Net fuel expense (fuel and fuel taxes net of fuel surcharge revenue and surcharges passed through to independent contractors, outside drayage carriers and railroads) decreased $5.6 million, or 12.0%, to $41.1 million in 2015 from $46.7 million in 2014. Fuel surcharges passed through to independent contractors, outside drayage carriers and railroads were $8.9 million in 2015 and $18.0 million in 2014. We have worked diligently to control fuel usage and costs by improving our volume purchasing arrangements and optimizing our drivers\u2019 fuel purchases with national fuel centers, focusing on shorter lengths of haul, installing and tightly managing the use of auxiliary power units in our tractors to minimize engine idling and improving fuel usage in the temperature-control units on our trailers. The decrease in net fuel expense was primarily due to a decrease in the DOE national average cost of fuel to $2.71 per gallon in 2015 from $3.83 per gallon in 2014 and continued progress with the cost control measures stated above. Net fuel expense represented 7.9% of Truckload, Dedicated and Intermodal segment revenue, net of fuel surcharges, in 2015, compared with 9.5% in 2014.\nSupplies and maintenance consist of repairs, maintenance, tires, parts, oil, and engine fluids, along with load-specific expenses including loading\/unloading, tolls, pallets and trailer hostling. Our supplies and maintenance expense increased $1.8 million, or 4.4%, from 2014 primarily due to increased repair costs at external facilities.\nThe increase in depreciation was primarily due to a continued increase in the cost of revenue equipment and growth of our fleet.\nThe $2.0 million increase in insurance and claims in 2015 was primarily due to increases in the cost of physical damage claims related to our tractors and trailers, self-insured auto liability claims and workers\u2019 compensation accident claims.\nGain on disposition of revenue equipment increased to $5.6 million in 2015 from $4.4 million in 2014 primarily due to an increase in the number of trailers sold.\nGain on disposition of facilities was $4.1 million in 2015. The disposition of the facilities, located in Ontario, CA and Indianapolis, IN, was part of our ongoing program to expand and update the footprint of our facilities throughout the United States.\nAs a result of the foregoing factors, our operating expenses as a percentage of operating revenue, or \u201coperating ratio,\u201d improved to 90.8% in 2015 from 92.4% in 2014. The operating ratio for our Truckload segment was 91.1% in 2015 and 91.2% in 2014, for our Dedicated segment was 89.2% in 2015 and 89.9% in 2014, for our Intermodal segment was 93.7% in 2015 and 98.2% in 2014, and for our Brokerage segment was 94.7% in 2015 and 95.4% in 2014. Operating expenses as a percentage of operating revenue, with both amounts net of fuel surcharges, improved to 89.7% in 2015 from 90.7% in 2014\n. Our operating ratio for 2015, net of both the gain on the disposition of facilities and fuel surcharges, improved to 90.4%.\nThe decrease in other non-operating income was primarily due to decreased earnings in 2015 by MWL, a 45% owned affiliate.\nOur effective income tax rate decreased to 41.1% in 2015 from 42.3% in 2014, primarily due to per diem and other non-deductible expenses being a lower percentage of the increased taxable income in 2015.\nAs a result of the factors described above, net income increased by 19.8% to $35.7 million in 2015 from $29.8 million in 2014. Net earnings per diluted share increased to $1.06 in 2015 from $0.89 in 2014.\n29\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nOur business requires substantial, ongoing capital investments, particularly for new tractors and trailers. Our primary sources of liquidity are funds provided by operations and our revolving credit facility. A portion of our tractor fleet is provided by independent contractors who own and operate their own equipment. We have no capital expenditure requirements relating to those drivers who own their tractors or obtain financing through third parties.\nThe table below reflects our net cash flows provided by operating activities, net cash flows used for investing activities and net cash flows (used for) provided by financing activities for the years indicated.\n(In thousands)\n201\n6\n2015\n2014\nNet cash flows provided by operating\nactivities\n$133,566\n$128,238\n$81,971\nNet cash flows used for\ninvesting activities\n(97,290\n)\n(125,081\n)\n(118,606\n)\nNet cash flows (used for) provided by\nfinancing activities\n(36,222\n)\n(2,846\n)\n23,108\nIn December 2007, our Board of Directors approved and we announced a share repurchase program to repurchase up to one million shares of our common stock either through purchases on the open market or through private transactions and in accordance with Rule 10b-18 of the Exchange Act. In November 2015, our Board of Directors approved and we announced an increase in the share repurchase program, providing for the repurchase of up to $40 million, or approximately 2 million shares, of our common stock. The timing and extent to which we repurchase shares depends on market conditions and other corporate considerations. The repurchase program does not have an expiration date.\nWe repurchased and retired 455,581 shares of our common stock for $7.5 million in the first quarter of 2016 and did not repurchase any shares in the last three quarters of 2016. In the fourth quarter of 2015 we repurchased and retired 941,024 shares of our common stock for $16.2 million.\nIn 2016, net cash flows provided by operating activities of $133.6 million were primarily used to purchase new revenue equipment, net of proceeds from dispositions, in the amount of $89.9 million, to partially construct regional operating facilities in the amount of $5.1 million, to repay, net of borrowings, $30.0 million of long-term debt, to repurchase and retire 455,581 shares of our common stock for $7.5 million, and to pay cash dividends of $3.3 million. In 2015, net cash flows provided by operating activities of $128.2 million and net borrowings under our credit facility of $13.5 million were primarily used to purchase new revenue equipment, net of proceeds from dispositions, in the amount of $118.2 million, to partially construct regional operating facilities in the amount of $8.6 million, to repurchase and retire 941,024 shares of our common stock for $16.2 million, and to pay cash dividends of $3.3 million. In 2014, net cash flows provided by operating activities of $82.0 million, net borrowings under our credit facility of $24.4 million, and cash and cash equivalents of $13.5 million were primarily used to purchase new revenue equipment, net of proceeds from dispositions, in the amount of $87.7 million, to acquire and partially construct regional operating facilities in the amount of $27.4 million, and to pay cash dividends of $3.3 million.\n30\nWe estimate that capital expenditures, net of proceeds from dispositions, will be approximately $88 million in 2017.\nQuarterly cash dividends of $0.025 per share of common stock were declared in each quarter of 2016, 2015 and 2014, and totaled $3.3 million in each of the three years respectively. We currently expect to continue to pay quarterly cash dividends in the future. The payment of cash dividends in the future, and the amount of any such dividends, will depend upon our financial condition, results of operations, cash requirements, and certain corporate law requirements, as well as other factors deemed relevant by our Board of Directors. We believe our sources of liquidity are adequate to meet our current and anticipated needs for at least the next twelve months. Based upon anticipated cash flows, existing cash and cash equivalents balances, current borrowing availability and other sources of financing we expect to be available to us, we do not anticipate any significant liquidity constraints in the foreseeable future.\nWe maintain a credit agreement that provides for an unsecured committed credit facility which matures in December 2019. In November 2015, we entered into an amendment to the facility which increased the aggregate principal amount of the facility from $50.0 million to $75.0 million. In April 2016, we elected to reduce the aggregate principal amount of the facility to $30.0 million. In December 2016, we entered into an amendment to the facility which increased the aggregate principal amount to $40.0 million. At December 31, 2016, there was an outstanding principal balance of $7.9 million on the facility. As of that date, we had outstanding standby letters of credit to guarantee settlement of self-insurance claims of $11.2 million and remaining borrowing availability of $20.9 million. This facility bears interest at a variable rate based on the London Interbank Offered Rate or the lender\u2019s Prime Rate, in each case plus\/minus applicable margins.\nOur credit facility prohibits us from paying, in any fiscal year, stock redemptions and dividends in excess of 25% of our net income from the prior fiscal year. A waiver of the 25% limitation for 2015 and 2016 was obtained from the lender. This facility also contains restrictive covenants which, among other matters, require us to maintain compliance with cash flow leverage and fixed charge coverage ratios. We were in compliance with all covenants at December 31, 2016 and 2015.\nThe following is a summary of our contractual obligations as of December 31, 2016.\nPayments Due by Period\n(In thousands)\n2017\n2018\nAnd\n2019\n2020\nAnd\n2021\nThereafter\nTotal\nPurchase obligations for\nrevenue equipment\n$50,662\n$\u2014\n$\u2014\n$\u2014\n$50,662\nLong-term debt obligations\n\u2014\n7,886\n\u2014\n\u2014\n7,886\nOperating lease obligations\n280\n148\n2\n\u2014\n430\nBuilding construction\nobligations\n95\n\u2014\n\u2014\n\u2014\n95\nTotal\n$51,037\n$8,034\n$2\n$\u2014\n$59,073\nDue to uncertainty with respect to the timing of future cash flows, the obligation under our nonqualified deferred compensation plan at December 31, 2016 of 96,310 shares of Company common stock with a value of $2.2 million has been excluded from the above table.\nRelated Parties\nWe purchase fuel and tires and obtain related services from Bauer Built, Inc., or BBI. Jerry M. Bauer, one of our directors, is the chairman of the board, chief executive officer and the principal stockholder of BBI. We paid BBI $361,000 in 2016, $335,000 in 2015 and $562,000 in 2014 for fuel, tires and related services. In addition, we paid $2.0 million in 2016, $1.5 million in 2015 and $1.4 million in 2014 to tire manufacturers for tires that were provided by BBI. BBI received commissions from the tire manufacturers related to these purchases. Other than any benefit received from his ownership interest in BBI, Mr. Bauer receives no compensation or other benefits from our business with BBI.\n31\nWe own a 45% equity interest in MWL, a third-party provider of logistics services to the transportation industry. We received $1.2 million, $5.0 million and $8.5 million of our revenue for loads transported by our tractors and arranged by MWL in 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively. As of December 31, 2016, we also had a trade receivable in the amount of $55,000 from MWL and an accrued liability of $3.0 million to MWL for the excess of payments by MWL\u2019s customers into our lockbox account over the amounts drawn on the account by MWL.\nWe believe that the transactions with related parties noted above are on reasonable terms which, based upon market rates, are comparable to terms available from unaffiliated third parties.\nOff-balance Sheet Arrangements\nOther than standby letters of credit maintained in connection with our self-insurance programs in the amount of $11.2 million, purchase obligations and operating leases summarized above in our summary of contractual obligations, we did not have any other material off-balance sheet arrangements at December 31, 2016.\nInflation and Fuel Costs\nMost of our operating expenses are inflation-sensitive, with inflation generally producing increased costs of operations. During the past three years, the most significant effects of inflation have been on revenue equipment prices, accident claims, health insurance and employee compensation. We attempt to limit the effects of inflation through increases in freight rates and cost control efforts.\nIn addition to inflation, fluctuations in fuel prices can affect our profitability. We require substantial amounts of fuel to operate our tractors and power the temperature-control units on our trailers. Substantially all of our contracts with customers contain fuel surcharge provisions. Although we historically have been able to pass through a significant portion of long-term increases in fuel prices and related taxes to customers in the form of fuel surcharges and higher rates, such increases usually are not fully recovered. These fuel surcharge provisions are not effective in mitigating the fuel price increases related to non-revenue miles or fuel used while the tractor is idling.\nSeasonality\nOur tractor productivity generally decreases during the winter season because inclement weather impedes operations and some shippers reduce their shipments. At the same time, operating expenses generally increase, with harsh weather creating higher accident frequency, increased claims, lower fuel efficiency and more equipment repairs.\nCritical Accounting Policies\nThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions about future events, and apply judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue and expenses in our consolidated financial statements and related notes. We base our estimates, assumptions and judgments on historical experience, current trends and other factors believed to be relevant at the time our consolidated financial statements are prepared. However, because future events and their effects cannot be determined with certainty, actual results could differ from our estimates and assumptions, and such differences could be material. We believe that the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant estimates, assumptions and judgments used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements.\n32\nRevenue Recognition.\nWe recognize revenue, including fuel surcharges,\nat the time shipment of freight is completed. We account for revenue of our Intermodal and Brokerage segments and revenue on freight transported by independent contractors within our Truckload and Dedicated segments on a gross basis because we are the primary obligor in the arrangements, we have the ability to establish prices, we have the risk of loss in the event of cargo claims and we bear credit risk with customer payments. Accordingly, all such revenue billed to customers is classified as operating revenue and all corresponding payments to carriers for transportation services we arrange in connection with brokerage and intermodal activities and to independent contractor providers of revenue equipment are classified as purchased transportation expense.\nAccounts Receivable.\nWe are dependent upon a limited number of customers, and, as a result, our trade accounts receivable are highly concentrated.\nTrade accounts receivable are recorded at the invoiced amounts, net of an allowance for doubtful accounts. Our allowance for doubtful accounts was $275,000 as of December 31, 2016 and $305,000 as of December 31, 2015. A considerable amount of judgment is required in assessing the realization of these receivables including the current creditworthiness of each customer and related aging of the past-due balances, including any billing disputes. In order to assess the collectibility of these receivables, we perform ongoing credit evaluations of our customers\u2019 financial condition. Through these evaluations, we may become aware of a situation where a customer may not be able to meet its financial obligations due to deterioration of its financial viability, credit ratings or bankruptcy. The allowance for doubtful accounts is based on the best information available to us and is reevaluated and adjusted as additional information is received. We evaluate the allowance based on historical write-off experience, the size of the individual customer balances, past-due amounts and the overall national economy. We review the adequacy of our allowance for doubtful accounts monthly.\nProperty and Equipment.\nThe transportation industry requires significant capital investments. Our net property and equipment was $557.8 million as of December 31, 2016 and $528.0 million as of December 31, 2015. Our depreciation expense was $82.4 million in 2016, $75.3 million in 2015 and $68.2 million in 2014. We compute depreciation of our property and equipment for financial reporting purposes based on the cost of each asset, reduced by its estimated salvage value, using the straight-line method over its estimated useful life. We determine and periodically evaluate our estimate of the projected salvage values and useful lives primarily by considering the market for used equipment, prior useful lives and changes in technology. We have not changed our policy regarding salvage values as a percentage of initial cost or useful lives of tractors and trailers within the last ten years. We believe that our policies and past estimates have been reasonable. Actual results could differ from these estimates. A 5% decrease in estimated salvage values would have decreased our net property and equipment as of December 31, 2016 by approximately $10.6 million, or 1.9%.\nImpairment of Assets.\nLong-lived assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. Recoverability of assets to be held and used is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of an asset to future net undiscounted cash flows expected to be generated by the asset. If such assets are considered to be impaired, the impairment to be recognized is measured by the amount by which the carrying amount of the assets exceeds the fair value of the assets. Assets to be disposed of are reported at the lower of the carrying amount or fair value less the costs to sell.\n33\nInsurance and Claims.\nWe self-insure, in part, for losses relating to workers\u2019 compensation, auto liability, general liability, cargo and property damage claims, along with employees\u2019 health insurance with varying risk retention levels. We maintain insurance coverage for per-incident and total losses in excess of these risk retention levels in amounts we consider adequate based upon historical experience and our ongoing review. However, we could suffer a series of losses within our self-insured retention limits or losses over our policy limits, which could negatively affect our financial condition and operating results. We are responsible for the first $1.0 million on each auto liability claim and for the first $750,000 on each workers\u2019 compensation claim. We have $11.2 million in standby letters of credit to guarantee settlement of claims under agreements with our insurance carriers and regulatory authorities. The insurance and claims accruals in our consolidated balance sheets were $19.4 million as of December 31, 2016 and $16.2 million as of December 31, 2015. We reserve currently for the estimated cost of the uninsured portion of pending claims. We periodically evaluate and adjust these reserves based on our evaluation of the nature and severity of outstanding individual claims and our estimate of future claims development based on historical development. Actual results could differ from these current estimates. In addition, to the extent that claims are litigated and not settled, jury awards are difficult to predict.\nShare-based Payment Arrangement Compensation.\nWe have granted stock options to certain employees and non-employee directors. We recognize compensation expense for all stock options net of an estimated forfeiture rate and only record compensation expense for those shares expected to vest on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period (normally the vesting period). Determining the appropriate fair value model and calculating the fair value of stock options require the input of highly subjective assumptions, including the expected life of the stock options and stock price volatility. We use the Black-Scholes model to value our stock option awards. We believe that future volatility will not materially differ from our historical volatility. Thus, we use the historical volatility of our common stock over the expected life of the award. The assumptions used in calculating the fair value of stock options represent our best estimates, but these estimates involve inherent uncertainties and the application of judgment. As a result, if factors change and we use different assumptions, stock option compensation expense could be materially different in the future.\nWe have also granted performance unit awards to certain employees which are subject to vesting requirements over a five-year period, primarily based on our earnings growth. The fair value of each performance unit is based on the closing market price on the date of grant. We recognize compensation expense for these awards based on the estimated number of units probable of achieving the performance and service vesting requirements of the awards, net of an estimated forfeiture rate.\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\nIn May 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board, or FASB, issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2014-09, \u201cRevenue from Contracts with Customers\u201d which requires an entity to recognize the amount of revenue to which it expects to be entitled for the transfer of promised goods or services to customers. The standard, which is effective for the first quarter of 2018, will replace most existing revenue recognition guidance required by U.S. generally accepted accounting principles and will require additional disclosures. We have completed our evaluation of the requirements of the new guidance and have determined that our current policy in which we record revenue and related expenses on the date shipment of freight is completed, and in which we account for revenue of our Intermodal and Brokerage segments and revenue on freight transported by independent contractors within our Truckload and Dedicated segments on a gross basis, is also appropriate under the new guidance. As a result, the adoption of this standard is not expected to have a significant impact on our consolidated balance sheets, statements of operations or statements of cash flows.\n34\nIn February 2016, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2016-02, \u201cLeases\u201d which requires organizations that lease assets to recognize on the balance sheet the assets and liabilities for the rights and obligations created by those leases. The new guidance also requires additional disclosures related to leasing transactions. The standard is effective for the first quarter of 2019. The adoption of this standard is not expected to have a significant impact on our consolidated balance sheets, statements of operations or statements of cash flows.\nIn March 2016, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2016-09, \u201cCompensation - Stock Compensation: Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting\u201d which simplifies several aspects of the accounting for share-based payment transactions, including the income tax consequences, classification of awards as either equity or liabilities and classification on the statement of cash flows. The standard is effective for the first quarter of 2017. The adoption of this standard will result in an increase or decrease to our provision for income taxes each quarter based on the actual increase in our stock price compared with the grant-date fair value of the quarter\u2019s exercised options and vested performance unit awards. The adoption of the other provisions of this standard is not expected to have a significant impact on our consolidated balance sheets, statements of operations or statements of cash flows.","47":"ITEM 7.\nMANAGEMENT\u2019S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nOverview\nThe following discussion presents information about our consolidated results of operations, financial condition, liquidity and capital resources and should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto included in Item 8 of this Report.\nOur principal operating subsidiary is Pacific Mercantile Bank (the \u201cBank\u201d), which is a California state chartered bank. The Bank accounts for substantially all of our consolidated revenues, expenses and income and our consolidated assets and liabilities. Accordingly, the following discussion focuses primarily on the Bank\u2019s results of operations and financial condition.\nAs of\nDecember 31, 2016\n, our total assets, net loans and total deposits were\n$1.1 billion\n,\n$932 million\nand\n$1.0 billion\n, respectively.\nThe Bank, which is headquartered in Orange County, California, approximately 40 miles south of Los Angeles, conducts a commercial banking business in Orange, Los Angeles, San Bernardino and San Diego counties in Southern California. The Bank is also a member of the Federal Reserve System and its deposits are insured, to the maximum extent permitted by law, by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (the \u201cFDIC\u201d). For the years ended\nDecember 31, 2016\n,\n2015\nand\n2014\n, we operated as one reportable segment, Commercial Banking, and one non-reportable segment, Discontinued Operations.\nUnless the context otherwise requires, the \u201cCompany,\u201d \u201cwe,\u201d \u201cour,\u201d \u201cours,\u201d and \u201cus\u201d refer to Pacific Mercantile Bancorp and its consolidated subsidiaries.\nCurrent Developments\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2016, the Company recognized total charge-offs of\n$17.0 million\n, which primarily consisted of three credits that totaled $14.5 million, including a $12.0 million charge-off of the entire balance of a participated shared national credit. With respect to this credit, during the year ended December 31, 2016, the borrower experienced rapid deterioration, entered bankruptcy proceedings and faced unanticipated litigation that challenged the ownership of the underlying collateral. In light of these events, the Company determined it was appropriate to charge-off the entire balance of the credit during the year. In addition, after a comprehensive credit review that our new Chief Credit Officer commenced upon joining the Bank on May 31, 2016, the Bank has now reviewed all 679 commercial and commercial real estate credits representing approximately 87% of our total outstanding loan portfolio balance as of December 31, 2016, assisted by three independent loan review firms. The remaining 13% of the portfolio consists of consumer loans with low levels of delinquencies, which are monitored for signs of weakness including periodic sampling of loans which have been found to be satisfactory. During the third quarter of 2016, approximately $48 million in loans were downgraded due to credit and collateral shortfalls, including portfolio management and loan servicing follow-up items such as lack of updated borrower financial information. As a result, the Company recorded a provision for loan losses totaling\n$19.9 million\nduring the year ended December 31, 2016, resulting from the elevated charge-offs and higher loss factor due to an increase in the amount of classified loans. During the second half of 2016, the Company instituted a number of changes to strengthen its overall credit administration. As a result, of the $48 million in loan downgrades during the three months ended September 30, 2016, $13.7 million in principal payments were received and $2.2 million in loan upgrades were made during the fourth quarter of 2016.  This represents a 33% reduction and improvement from September 30, 2016 to December 31, 2016,\nleaving $32 million in loan downgrades taken in the third quarter of 2016 that we continue to manage and currently anticipate being paid down or upgraded by the middle of 2017.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2016, the Company recorded income tax expense of\n$16.8 million\nto reflect a full valuation allowance established against its deferred tax asset. See \u201c\nResults of Operations\u2014Provision for Income Tax\n\u201d below in this Item 7 for additional information.  While we believe the Company will generate taxable income in future periods that will eventually enable the Company to release all or a portion of the valuation allowance, we are not able to assert as to the timing of that event. Until such time as we are able to release the valuation allowance on our deferred tax asset, there is a material impact to future periods in that management expects this to result in minimal income tax expense.\nAs a result of the net loss we incurred during the year ended December 31, 2016, our regulatory capital ratios declined during the year. Notwithstanding this, the Company and the Bank remain well capitalized under applicable regulatory standards. See \u201c\nCapital Resources\u2014Regulatory Capital Requirements Applicable to Banking Institutions\n\u201d below in this Item 7 for further information.\n31\nTable of Contents\nResults of Operations\nDiscontinued Operations\nIn connection with our exit from the mortgage banking business in 2013, the revenues and expenses of our mortgage banking division have been classified as discontinued operations for all periods presented. As a result, all comparisons below reflect results from continuing operations. Income from discontinued operations was\nzero\nfor the\nyear\ns ended\nDecember 31, 2016\nand 2015, while our income from discontinued operations was\n$1.2 million\nfor the\nyear ended\nDecember 31, 2014\n. We had no income from discontinued operations during the years ended\nDecember 31, 2016\nand 2015 as a result of the final wind down of the mortgage banking division during 2014. During the year ended\nDecember 31, 2014\n, we recorded a gain in the amount of\n$558 thousand\non the sale of the mortgage servicing rights that we sold in April 2014, which is included in income from discontinued operations in the consolidated statements of operations.\nOperating Results for the Years Ended\nDecember 31, 2016\n,\n2015\n, and\n2014\nOur operating results for the year ended\nDecember 31, 2016\n, compared to\nDecember 31, 2015\n, and for the year ended\nDecember 31, 2015\n, compared to\nDecember 31, 2014\n, were as follows.\nYear Ended December 31,\n2016\n2015\n2014\n2016 vs. 2015% Change\n2015 vs. 2014% Change\n(Dollars in thousands)\nInterest income\n41,000\n38,797\n38,290\n5.7%\n1.3%\nInterest expense\n5,477\n5,269\n5,829\n3.9%\n(9.6\n)%\nProvision for loan and lease losses\n19,870\n\u2014\n1,500\n100.0%\n(100.0\n)%\nNon-interest income\n2,937\n2,686\n4,370\n9.3%\n(38.5\n)%\nNon-interest expense\n36,401\n35,324\n36,808\n3.0%\n(4.0\n)%\nIncome tax provision (benefit)\n16,832\n(11,551\n)\n(608\n)\n(245.7\n)%\n1,799.8%\nNet (loss) income from continuing operations\n(34,643\n)\n12,441\n(869\n)\n(378.5\n)%\n(1,531.6\n)%\nNet income from discontinued operations\n\u2014\n\u2014\n1,226\n\u2014%\n(100.0\n)%\nNet (loss) income allocable to common shareholders\n(34,643\n)\n11,002\n(806\n)\n(414.9\n)%\n(1,465.0\n)%\nInterest Income\n2016\nvs.\n2015.\nTotal interest income increased\n5.7%\nto\n$41.0 million\nfor the year ended\nDecember 31, 2016\nfrom\n$38.8 million\nfor the year ended\nDecember 31, 2015\n. This increase is primarily due to an increase in interest income on loans during the\nyear\nended\nDecember 31, 2016\ncompared to the prior year due to an increase in average loan balances, as well as an increase in the average yield on loans. During the year ended\nDecember 31, 2016\nand\n2015\n, interest income on loans was\n$38.6 million\nand\n$36.7 million\n, respectively, yielding\n4.50%\nand\n4.43%\non average loan balances of\n$857.7 million\nand\n$827.9 million\n, respectively. The increase in the average loan balances is attributable to an increase in loan demand. The increase in loan yield is primarily attributable to the actions of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (\u201cFederal Reserve Board\u201d) to raise short-term interest rates by 25 basis points in the fourth quarter of 2016. The average yield on interest-earning assets was\n3.81%\nfor the year ended\nDecember 31, 2016\ncompared to\n3.76%\nfor the year ended\nDecember 31, 2015.\nDuring the\nyear\nended\nDecember 31, 2016\nand\n2015\n, interest income from our securities available-for-sale and stock, was\n$1.6 million\nand\n$1.7 million\n, yielding\n2.76%\nand\n2.63%\non average balances of\n$57.1 million\nand\n$65.0 million\n, respectively.\nThe average securities balances decreased as a result of maturities of, and payments on, securities which we did not fully replace due to liquidity needs. Interest income from our short-term investments, including our federal funds sold and interest-bearing deposits, was\n$842 thousand\nand\n$370 thousand\nfor the\nyear\nended\nDecember 31, 2016\nand\n2015\n, respectively, yielding\n0.52%\nand\n0.27%\non average balances of\n$162.6 million\nand\n$139.3 million\n, respectively. The increase in the average yield is attributable to the Federal Reserve Board raising interest rates by 25 basis points in the fourth quarter of 2016. As a result, total interest income on investments increased for the\nyear\nended\nDecember 31, 2016.\n2015\nvs.\n2014.\nTotal interest income increased\n1.3%\nto\n$38.8 million\nfor the year ended\nDecember 31, 2015\nfrom\n$38.3 million\nfor the year ended\nDecember 31, 2014\n. This increase is primarily due to an increase in interest income on loans during the year ended\nDecember 31, 2015 compared to the prior year due to an increase in average loan balances, partially offset by a decline in the\n32\nTable of Contents\naverage yield on loans. During the years ended\nDecember 31, 2015\nand\n2014\n, interest income on loans was\n$36.7 million\nand\n$36.3 million\n, respectively, yielding\n4.43%\nand\n4.54%\non average loan balances of\n$827.9 million\nand\n$799.9 million\n, respectively. The increase in the average loan balances is attributable to an increase in loan demand. The decrease in loan yield is primarily attributable to the actions of the Federal Reserve Board to keep short-term interest rates low. The average yield on interest-earning assets was\n3.76%\nfor the year ended\nDecember 31, 2015\ncompared to\n3.81%\nfor the year ended\nDecember 31, 2014.\nDuring the year ended\nDecember 31, 2015\nand\n2014\n, interest income from our securities available-for-sale and stock, was\n$1.7 million\nand\n$1.6 million\n, respectively, yielding\n2.63%\nand\n2.27%\non average balances of\n$65.0 million\nand\n$71.2 million\n, respectively. The investment yield increase is primarily due to our receipt of a cash dividend paid on our FHLB stock during the year ended December 31, 2015. The average securities balances decreased as a result of maturities of, and payments on, securities which we did not fully replace due to liquidity needs. Interest income from our short-term investments, including our federal funds sold and interest-bearing deposits, was\n$370 thousand\nand\n$333 thousand\nfor the years ended\nDecember 31, 2015\nand\n2014\n, respectively, yielding\n0.27%\nand\n0.25%\non average balances of\n$139.3 million\nand\n$134.6 million\n, respectively. The increase in the average yield is attributable to the Federal Reserve Board raising interest rates by 25 basis points in the fourth quarter of 2015. As a result, total interest income on investments increased for the\nyear\nended\nDecember 31, 2015.\nInterest Expense\n2016\nvs.\n2015.\nTotal interest expense increased\n3.9%\nto\n$5.5 million\nfor the\nyear\nended\nDecember 31, 2016\nfrom\n$5.3 million\nfor the\nyear\nended\nDecember 31, 2015\n. The increase was primarily due to an increase in the average cost of funds of our interest-bearing liabilities to\n0.81%\nat\nDecember 31, 2016\nfrom\n0.76%\nat\nDecember 31, 2015\n, which consisted of deposits, borrowings and junior subordinated debentures, primarily as a result of an increase in the rates of interest paid on our deposits, partially offset by a decrease in the volume of our certificates of deposit and other borrowings. Interest expense on our certificates of deposit for the years ended\nDecember 31, 2016\nand\n2015\nwas\n$2.6 million\nand\n$2.8 million\n, respectively, with a cost of funds of\n0.99%\nand\n0.90%\non average balances of\n$263.6 million\nand\n$308.5 million\n, respectively.\n2015\nvs.\n2014.\nTotal interest expense decreased\n9.6%\nto\n$5.3 million\nfor the year ended\nDecember 31, 2015\nfrom\n$5.8 million\nfor the year ended\nDecember 31, 2014\n. The decrease was primarily due to a decrease in the cost of funds of our interest-bearing liabilities to\n0.76%\nat\nDecember 31, 2015\nfrom\n0.82%\nat\nDecember 31, 2014\n, which consisted of deposits, borrowings and junior subordinated debentures, primarily as a result of a decrease in the volume of certificates of deposit. Interest expense on our certificates of deposit for the years ended\nDecember 31, 2015\nand\n2014\nwas\n$2.8 million\nand\n$4.1 million\n, respectively, with a cost of funds of\n0.90%\nand\n0.96%\n, on average balances of\n$308.5 million\nand\n$431.8 million\n, respectively. The decrease in our interest expense was partially offset by an increase in the volume of and rates of interest paid on our savings and money market accounts.\nNet Interest Margin\nOne of the principal determinants of a bank\u2019s income is its net interest income, which is the difference between (i) the interest that a bank earns on loans, investment securities and other interest earning assets, on the one hand, and (ii) its interest expense, which consists primarily of the interest it must pay to attract and retain deposits and the interest that it pays on borrowings and other interest-bearing liabilities, on the other hand. As a general rule, all other things being equal, the greater the difference or \"spread\" between the amount of our interest income and the amount of our interest expense, the greater will be our net income; whereas, a decline in that difference or \"spread\" will generally result in a decline in our net income.\nA bank\u2019s interest income and interest expense are affected by a number of factors, some of which are outside of its control, including national and local economic conditions and the monetary policies of the Federal Reserve Board which affect interest rates, competition in the market place for loans and deposits, the demand for loans and the ability of borrowers to meet their loan payment obligations. Net interest income, when expressed as a percentage of total average interest earning assets, is a banking organization\u2019s \u201cnet interest margin.\u201d\nThe following tables set forth information regarding our average balance sheet, yields on interest earning assets, interest expense on interest-bearing liabilities, the interest rate spread and the interest rate margin for the years ended\nDecember 31, 2016\n,\n2015\nand\n2014\n. Average balances are calculated based on average daily balances.\n33\nTable of Contents\nYear Ended December 31,\n2016\n2015\n2014\nAverage\nBalance\nInterest\nEarned\/\nPaid\nAverage\nYield\/\nRate\nAverage\nBalance\nInterest\nEarned\/\nPaid\nAverage\nYield\/\nRate\nAverage\nBalance\nInterest\nEarned\/\nPaid\nAverage\nYield\/\nRate\n(Dollars in thousands)\nInterest earning assets\nShort-term investments\n(1)\n$162,585\n$842\n0.52%\n$139,341\n$370\n0.27%\n$134,641\n$333\n0.25%\nSecurities available for sale and stock\n(2)\n57,135\n1,578\n2.76%\n64,960\n1,710\n2.63%\n71,202\n1,613\n2.27%\nLoans\n(3)\n857,666\n38,580\n4.50%\n827,900\n36,717\n4.43%\n799,900\n36,344\n4.54%\nTotal interest-earning assets\n1,077,386\n41,000\n3.81%\n1,032,201\n38,797\n3.76%\n1,005,743\n38,290\n3.81%\nNoninterest-earning assets\nCash and due from banks\n15,533\n16,621\n12,947\nAll other assets\n14,550\n10,113\n21,121\nTotal assets\n$1,107,469\n$1,058,935\n$1,039,811\nInterest-bearing liabilities.\nInterest-bearing checking accounts\n$60,024\n$162\n0.27%\n$40,916\n$95\n0.23%\n$36,281\n100\n0.28%\nMoney market and savings accounts\n327,401\n2,048\n0.63%\n300,088\n1,699\n0.57%\n170,047\n585\n0.34%\nCertificates of deposit\n263,569\n2,610\n0.99%\n308,529\n2,765\n0.90%\n431,789\n4,133\n0.96%\nOther borrowings\n7,407\n75\n1.01%\n26,164\n203\n0.78%\n52,031\n437\n0.84%\nJunior subordinated debentures\n17,527\n582\n3.32%\n17,527\n507\n2.89%\n17,527\n574\n3.27%\nTotal interest bearing liabilities\n675,928\n5,477\n0.81%\n693,224\n5,269\n0.76%\n707,675\n5,829\n0.82%\nNoninterest-bearing liabilities\nDemand deposits\n299,447\n237,371\n206,295\nAccrued expenses and other liabilities\n6,380\n6,773\n8,355\nShareholders' equity\n125,714\n121,567\n117,486\nTotal liabilities and shareholders' equity\n$1,107,469\n$1,058,935\n$1,039,811\nNet interest income\n$35,523\n$33,528\n$32,461\nNet interest income\/spread\n3.00%\n3.00%\n2.99%\nNet interest margin\n3.30%\n3.25%\n3.23%\n(1)\nShort-term investments consist of federal funds sold and interest bearing deposits that we maintain at other financial institutions.\n(2)\nStock consists of Federal Home Loan Bank (\u201cFHLB\u201d) stock and Federal Reserve Bank stock.\n(3)\nLoans include the average balance of nonaccrual loans and loan fees.\nThe following table sets forth changes in interest income, including loan fees, and interest paid in each of the years ended\nDecember 31, 2016\n,\n2015\nand\n2014\nand the extent to which those changes were attributable to changes in (i) the volumes of or in the rates of interest earned on interest-earning assets and (ii) the volumes of or in the rates of interest paid on our interest-bearing liabilities.\n34\nTable of Contents\n2016 Compared to 2015\nIncrease (Decrease) due to Changes in\n2015 Compared to 2014\nIncrease (Decrease) due to Changes in\nVolume\nRates\nTotal\nIncrease\n(Decrease)\nVolume\nRates\nTotal\nIncrease\n(Decrease)\n(Dollars in thousands)\nInterest income\nShort-term investments\n(1)\n$70\n$402\n$472\n$12\n$25\n$37\nSecurities available for sale and stock\n(2)\n(213\n)\n81\n(132\n)\n(149\n)\n246\n97\nLoans\n1,334\n529\n1,863\n1,254\n(881\n)\n373\nTotal earning assets\n1,191\n1,012\n2,203\n1,117\n(610\n)\n507\nInterest expense\nInterest-bearing checking accounts\n50\n17\n67\n12\n(17\n)\n(5\n)\nMoney market and savings accounts\n162\n187\n349\n604\n510\n1,114\nCertificates of deposit\n(428\n)\n273\n(155\n)\n(1,118\n)\n(250\n)\n(1,368\n)\nBorrowings\n(176\n)\n48\n(128\n)\n(203\n)\n(31\n)\n(234\n)\nJunior subordinated debentures\n\u2014\n75\n75\n\u2014\n(67\n)\n(67\n)\nTotal interest-bearing liabilities\n(392\n)\n600\n208\n(705\n)\n145\n(560\n)\nNet interest income\n$1,583\n$412\n$1,995\n$1,822\n$(755\n)\n$1,067\n(1)\nShort-term investments consist of federal funds sold and interest bearing deposits that we maintain at financial institutions.\n(2)\nStock consists of FHLB stock and Federal Reserve Bank stock.\nProvision for Loan and Lease Losses\nWe maintain reserves to provide for loan losses that occur in the ordinary course of the banking business. When it is determined that the payment in full of a loan has become unlikely, the carrying value of the loan is reduced (\"written down\") to what management believes is its realizable value or, if it is determined that a loan no longer has any realizable value, the carrying value of the loan is written off in its entirety (a loan \"charge-off\"). Loan charge-offs and write-downs are charged against our allowance for loan and lease losses (\u201cALLL\u201d). The amount of the ALLL is increased periodically to replenish the ALLL after it has been reduced due to loan write-downs or charge-offs. The ALLL also is increased or decreased periodically to reflect increases or decreases in the volume of outstanding loans and to take account of changes in the risk of probable loan losses due to financial performance of borrowers, the value of collateral securing non-performing loans or changing economic conditions. Increases in the ALLL are made through a \"provision for loan and lease losses\" that is recorded as an expense in the statement of operations. Increases in the ALLL are also recognized through the recovery of charged-off loans which are added back to the ALLL. As such, recoveries are a direct offset for a provision for loan and lease losses that would otherwise be needed to replenish or increase the ALLL.\nWe employ economic models and data that conform to bank regulatory guidelines and reflect sound industry practices as well as our own historical loan loss experience to determine the sufficiency of the ALLL and any provisions needed to increase or replenish the ALLL. Those determinations involve judgments and assumptions about current economic conditions and external events that can impact the ability of borrowers to meet their loan obligations. However, the duration and impact of these factors cannot be determined with any certainty.  As such, unanticipated changes in economic or market conditions, bank regulatory guidelines or the sound practices that are used to determine the sufficiency of the ALLL, could require us to record additional, and possibly significant, provisions to increase the ALLL. This would have the effect of reducing reportable income or, in the most extreme circumstance, creating a reportable loss.  In addition, the Federal Reserve Bank and the California Department of Business Oversight (\u201cCDBO\u201d), as an integral part of their regulatory oversight, periodically review the adequacy of our ALLL. These agencies may require us to make additional provisions for perceived potential loan losses, over and above the provisions that we have already made, the effect of which would be to reduce our income or increase any losses we might incur.\nWe recorded a\n$19.9 million\nprovision for loan and lease losses during the\nyear\nended\nDecember 31, 2016\nas compared to\nno\nprovision for loan and lease losses recorded for the\nyear\nended\nDecember 31, 2015\n. We recorded a provision for loan and lease losses of\n$19.9 million\nfor the\nyear\nended\nDecember 31, 2016\nprimarily as a result of new loan growth and downgrades and charge offs on loans that exceeded recoveries during the year ended December 31, 2016.

We had income tax expense of\n$16.8 million\nduring the year ended\nDecember 31, 2016\nas a result of the establishment of a full valuation allowance during 2016 on the balance of our deferred tax asset, which includes current and historical losses that may be used to offset taxes on future profits.  Accounting rules specify that management must evaluate the deferred tax asset on a recurring basis to determine whether enough positive evidence exists to determine whether it is more-likely-than-not that the deferred tax asset will be available to offset or reduce future taxes.  Negative evidence included the significant losses incurred during the second and third quarters of 2016, an increase in our nonperforming assets from December 31, 2015, and our accumulated deficit. Positive evidence included our forecast of our taxable income, the time period in which we have to utilize our deferred tax asset and the current economic conditions. The tax code allows net operating losses to be carried forward for 20 years from the date of the loss, and while management believes that the Company will be able to realize the deferred tax asset within that period, we are unable to assert the timing as to when that realization will occur.  As a result of this conclusion and due to the hierarchy of evidence that the accounting rules specify, a valuation allowance has been recorded as of December 31, 2016 to offset the deferred tax asset.\nDuring the year ended\nDecember 31, 2015\n, we recorded an income tax benefit of\n$11.6 million\n. Management evaluated the positive and negative evidence and determined that there was enough positive evidence to support the full realization of the deferred tax asset and that no valuation allowance was needed. Positive evidence included projected taxable income utilizing objective assumptions based on 2015 actual results, tax planning strategies, improvement in economic conditions and at least 17 years remaining on the life of our\n$8.3 million\ndeferred tax asset generated from our net operating loss carryforward. Additionally, the Company has generated positive core earnings for the trailing six quarters which demonstrates the ability to be profitable in what is considered to be the Company's core business. While the decision to exit the mortgage business in 2013 did not necessarily ensure that the Company would become profitable, the results provide positive evidence that the decision to exit the unprofitable business is sufficient to overcome the losses incurred in recent years. Negative evidence we considered in making this determination included our three-year cumulative loss deficit and our accumulated deficit. Management determined that the expectation of future taxable income supported by our recent history of positive core earnings after adjusting for aberrational items that caused our cumulative loss condition, including discontinued operations, provided enough positive evidence to outweigh the negative evidence. Therefore, we concluded that it is more-likely-than-not that the existing\n$17.6 million\nnet deferred tax asset will be realized, resulting in the reversal of the entire valuation allowance against the Company's deferred tax asset. Although we do not expect to be required to pay income tax to the appropriate taxing authorities of any sizeable amount until we have depleted our net operating loss carryforwards, we expect to recognize income tax expense in our financial statements beginning in 2016 at a combined rate of approximately 41% on our pretax income.\nDuring the year ended\nDecember 31, 2014\n, we recorded an income tax benefit of\n$608 thousand\n.  Per Financial Accounting Standards Board's (\u201cFASB\u201d) Accounting Standards Codification (\u201cASC\u201d) 740-20-45-7 all sources of pre-tax income must be considered in determining the tax benefit that results from a loss from continuing operations and that shall be allocated to continuing operations. This benefit is the result of an intraperiod tax allocation where the benefit of the income tax provision that is recorded in discontinued operations and other comprehensive income created a tax benefit in continuing operations. On a net basis we recorded no income tax provision. Based on the analysis performed, and the positive and negative evidence considered, management chose not to release any portion of the\n$12.1 million\nvaluation allowance as of December 31, 2014. Positive evidence included improvement in our asset quality, tax planning strategies, projected taxable income, and improvement in economic conditions. Negative evidence included historical operating losses. Management determined the negative evidence was significant enough that until such time as we are in continuous periods of pre-tax income we would not make any reversals of our valuation allowance; however, we did conclude that it is more-likely-than-not that the existing\n$5.9 million\nnet deferred tax asset will be realized.\nSee \"\u2013\nCritical Accounting Policies -\nUtilization and Valuation of Deferred Income Tax Benefits\n\u201d below for additional information regarding our deferred tax asset.\nFinancial Condition\nAssets\nOur total consolidated assets increased by\n$78 million\nat\nDecember 31, 2016\nfrom\n$1.1 billion\nat\nDecember 31, 2015\n.

We have determined that declines in the fair values of these investments below their respective amortized costs, as set forth in the tables above, are temporary because (i) those declines were due to interest rate changes and not to a deterioration in the creditworthiness of the issuers of those investment securities, and (ii) we have the ability to hold those securities until there is a recovery in their values or until their maturity.\nWe recognize other-than-temporary impairments (\u201cOTTI\u201d) to our available-for-sale debt securities in accordance with ASC 320-10. When there are credit losses associated with, but we have no intention to sell, an impaired debt security, and it is more likely than not that we will not have to sell the security before recovery of its cost basis, we will separate the amount of impairment, or OTTI, between the amount that is credit related and the amount that is related to non-credit factors. Credit-related impairments are recognized in our consolidated statements of operations. Any non-credit-related impairments are recognized and reflected in other comprehensive income (loss).\nThrough the impairment assessment process, we determined that the available-for-sale securities discussed below were other-than-temporarily impaired at\nDecember 31, 2016\n.

Significant judgments are required with respect to these and other factors in order to make a determination of the future cash flows that can be expected to be generated by the security.\nBased on our OTTI assessment process, we determined that there is\none\nasset-backed security in our portfolio of securities available for sale that was impaired as of\nDecember 31, 2016\n. This security is a multi-class, cash flow collateralized bond obligation backed by a pool of trust preferred securities issued by a diversified pool of\n56\nissuers that consisted of\n45\nU.S. depository institutions and\n11\ninsurance companies at the time of the security\u2019s issuance in November 2007. We purchased\n$3.0 million\nface amount of this security in November 2007 at a price of\n95.21%\nfor a total purchase price of\n$2.9 million\n, out of a total of\n$363 million\nof this security sold at the time of issuance. The security that we own (CUSIP 74042CAE8) is the mezzanine class B piece security with a variable interest rate of 3 month LIBOR plus 60 basis points, which had a rating of Aa2 and AA by Moody\u2019s and Fitch, respectively, at the time of issuance in 2007.\nAs of\nDecember 31, 2016\nthe amortized cost of this security was\n$2.0 million\nwith a fair value of\n$1.4 million\n, for an unrealized loss of approximately\n$592 thousand\n.

Non-performing loans consist of (i) loans on non-accrual status which are loans on which the accrual of interest has been discontinued and include restructured loans when there has not been a history of past performance on debt service in accordance with the contractual terms of the restructured loans, and (ii) loans 90 days or more past due and still accruing interest. Non-performing assets are comprised of non-performing loans and OREO, which consists of real properties which we have acquired by or in lieu of foreclosure and which we intend to offer for sale.\n42\nTable of Contents\nLoans are placed on non-accrual status when, in our opinion, the full timely collection of principal or interest is in doubt. Generally, the accrual of interest is discontinued when principal or interest payments become more than 90 days past due, unless we believe the loan is adequately collateralized and the loan is in the process of collection. However, in certain instances, we may place a particular loan on non-accrual status earlier, depending upon the individual circumstances involved in that loan\u2019s delinquency. When a loan is placed on non-accrual status, previously accrued but unpaid interest is reversed against current income. Subsequent collections of unpaid amounts on such a loan are applied to reduce principal when received, except when the ultimate collectability of principal is probable, in which case such payments are applied to interest and are credited to income. Non-accrual loans may be restored to accrual status if and when principal and interest become current and full repayment is expected. Interest income is recognized on the accrual basis for impaired loans which, based on our non-accrual policy, do not require non-accrual treatment.\nThe following table sets forth information regarding our nonperforming assets, as well as information regarding restructured loans, at\nDecember 31, 2016\nand\nDecember 31, 2015\n.\nAt December 31, 2016\nAt December 31, 2015\n(Dollars in thousands)\nNonaccrual loans.\nCommercial loans\n$20,330\n$12,284\nCommercial real estate\n4,346\n10,083\nResidential real estate\n221\n1,148\nLand development\n\u2014\n1,618\nTotal nonaccrual loans\n$24,897\n$25,133\nLoans past due 90 days and still accruing interest.\nTotal loans past due 90 days and still accruing interest\n$\u2014\n$\u2014\nOther real estate owned (OREO).\nResidential real estate\n$\u2014\n$650\nTotal other real estate owned\n$\u2014\n$650\nTotal nonperforming assets\n$24,897\n$25,783\nRestructured loans.\nAccruing loans\n$\u2014\n$724\nNonaccruing loans (included in nonaccrual loans above)\n8,931\n20,070\nTotal restructured loans\n$8,931\n$20,794\nAs the above table indicates, total nonperforming assets decreased by approximately $886 thousand, or 3.4%, to\n$24.9 million\nas of\nDecember 31, 2016\nfrom\n$25.8 million\nas of\nDecember 31, 2015\n. The decrease in our non-performing loans resulted primarily from $8.4 million in payoffs, including the $4.0 million payoff of one legacy loan that was previously placed on nonaccrual status, pay downs of $7.8 million primarily related to two large loan relationships, and $17.0 million charged-off during the year ended\nDecember 31, 2016\n, partially offset by $33.4 million moving to nonaccrual status during the same period. The $33.4 million of loans moving to nonaccrual status, included a $12.5 million participated shared national credit placed on nonaccrual during the first quarter of 2016, for which $12.0 million was charged off during the year ended December 31, 2016. See \u201c\nCurrent Developments\n\u201d above in this Item 7 for additional information about the charge-off of this credit. The decrease in our OREO balance from December 31, 2015 related to the sale of the remaining portion of our OREO property during the first quarter of 2016, which resulted in a gain of $107 thousand during the year ended December 31, 2016.\nInformation Regarding Impaired Loans\n. At\nDecember 31, 2016\n, loans deemed impaired totaled\n$24.9 million\nas compared to\n$25.9 million\nat\nDecember 31, 2015\n. We had an average investment in impaired loans of\n$28.0 million\nfor the\nyear\nended\nDecember 31, 2016\nas compared to\n$28.8 million\nfor the year ended\nDecember 31, 2015\n. The interest that would have been earned during the\nyear\nended\nDecember 31, 2016\nhad the nonaccruing impaired loans remained current in accordance with their original terms was approximately\n$1.2 million.\n43\nTable of Contents\nThe following table sets forth the amount of impaired loans to which a portion of the ALLL has been specifically allocated, and the aggregate amount so allocated, in accordance with ASC 310-10, and the amount of the ALLL and the amount of impaired loans for which no such allocations were made, in each case at\nDecember 31, 2016\nand\nDecember 31, 2015\n.\nDecember 31, 2016\nDecember 31, 2015\nLoans\nReserves for\nLoan Losses% of\nReserves to\nLoans\nLoans\nReserves for\nLoan Losses% of\nReserves to\nLoans\n(Dollars in thousands)\nImpaired loans with specific reserves\n$3,309\n$2,042\n61.7%\n$1,621\n$484\n29.9%\nImpaired loans without specific reserves\n21,588\n\u2014\n\u2014\n24,236\n\u2014\n\u2014\nTotal impaired loans\n$24,897\n$2,042\n8.2%\n$25,857\n$484\n1.9%\nThe\n$1.0 million\ndecrease\nin impaired loans to\n$24.9 million\nat\nDecember 31, 2016\nfrom\n$25.9 million\nat\nDecember 31, 2015\nwas primarily attributable to $16.8 million in principal payments, $17.0 million charged-off on impaired loans, and $520 thousand of impaired loans transferred to accrual status during the year ended\nDecember 31, 2016\npartially offset by additions of $33.4 million to impaired loans during the same period. Of these amounts, a $12.5 million participated shared national credit was placed on nonaccrual during the first quarter of 2016, for which $7.5 million was charged off during the second quarter of 2016 and the remaining balance was charged off during the third quarter of 2016. See \u201c\nCurrent Developments\n\u201d above in this Item 7 for additional information about the charge-off of this credit.  Accruing restructured loans were comprised of a number of loans performing in accordance with modified terms, which included lowering of interest rates, deferral of payments, or modifications to payment terms. Based on an internal analysis, using the current estimated fair values of the collateral or the discounted present values of the future estimated cash flows of the impaired loans, we concluded that, at\nDecember 31, 2016\n,\n$2.0 million\nof specific reserves were required on three impaired loans and that all remaining impaired loans were well secured and adequately collateralized with no specific reserves required.\nAllowance for Loan and Lease Losses\n. The ALLL totaled\n$16.8 million\n, representing\n1.78%\nof loans outstanding, at\nDecember 31, 2016\n, as compared to\n$12.7 million\n, or\n1.48%\nof loans outstanding, at\nDecember 31, 2015.\nThe adequacy of the ALLL is determined through periodic evaluations of the loan portfolio and other factors that can reasonably be expected to affect the ability of borrowers to meet their loan obligations. Those factors are inherently subjective as the process for determining the adequacy of the ALLL involves some significant estimates and assumptions about such matters such as (i) economic conditions and trends and the amounts and timing of expected future cash flows of borrowers which can affect their ability to meet their loan obligations to us, (ii) the fair value of the collateral securing non-performing loans, (iii) estimates of losses that we may incur on non-performing loans, which are determined on the basis of historical loss experience and industry loss factors and bank regulatory guidelines, which are subject to change, and (iv) various qualitative factors. Since those factors are subject to changes in economic and other conditions and changes in regulatory guidelines or other circumstances over which we have no control, the amount of the ALLL may prove to be insufficient to cover all of the loan losses we might incur in the future. In such an event, it may become necessary for us to increase the ALLL from time to time to maintain its adequacy. Such increases are effectuated by means of a charge to income, referred to as the \u201cprovision for loan and lease losses\u201d, in our statements of our operations. See \u201c\u2014\nResults of Operations\n\u2014\nProvision for Loan and Lease Losses\n, above in this Item 7.\nThe amount of the ALLL is first determined by assigning reserve ratios for all loans. All non-accrual loans and other loans classified as \u201cSpecial Mention,\u201d \u201cSubstandard\u201d or \u201cDoubtful\u201d (\u201cclassified loans\u201d or \u201cclassification categories\u201d) and not fully collateralized are then assigned specific reserves within the ALLL, with greater reserve allocations made to loans deemed to be of a higher risk. These ratios are determined based on prior loss history and industry guidelines and loss factors, by type of loan, adjusted for current economic factors and current economic trends. Refer to Note 5, Loans and Allowance for Loan and Lease Losses for definitions related to our credit quality indicators stated above.\nOn a quarterly basis, we utilize a classification based loan loss migration model as well as review individual loans in determining the adequacy of the ALLL. Our loss migration analysis tracks a certain number of quarters of loan loss history and industry loss factors to determine historical losses by classification category for each loan type, except certain consumer loans (automobile, mortgage and credit cards), which are analyzed as homogeneous loan pools. These calculated loss factors are then applied to outstanding loan balances. We analyze impaired loans individually.\nIn determining whether and the extent to which we will make adjustments to our loan loss migration model for purposes of determining the ALLL, we also consider a number of qualitative factors that can affect the performance and the collectability of the loans in our loan portfolio. Such qualitative factors include.\n\u2022\nThe effects of changes that we may make in our loan policies or underwriting standards on the quality of the loans and the risks in our loan portfolios;\n44\nTable of Contents\n\u2022\nTrends and changes in local, regional and national economic conditions, as well as changes in industry specific conditions, and any other reasonably foreseeable events that could affect the performance or the collectability of the loans in our loan portfolios;\n\u2022\nMaterial changes that may occur in the mix or in the volume of the loans in our loan portfolios that could alter, whether positively or negatively, the risk profile of those portfolios;\n\u2022\nChanges in management or loan personnel or other circumstances that could, either positively or negatively, impact the application of our loan underwriting standards, the monitoring of nonperforming loans or our loan collection efforts; and\n\u2022\nExternal factors that, in addition to economic conditions, can affect the ability of borrowers to meet their loan obligations, such as fires, earthquakes and terrorist attacks.\nDetermining the effects that these qualitative factors may have on the performance of each category of loans in our loan portfolio requires numerous judgments, assumptions and estimates about conditions, trends and events which may subsequently prove to have been incorrect due to circumstances outside of our control. Moreover, the effects of qualitative factors such as these on the performance of our loan portfolios are often difficult to quantify. As a result, we may sustain loan losses in any particular period that are sizable in relation to the ALLL or that may even exceed the ALLL.\nSet forth below is information regarding loan balances and the related ALLL, by portfolio type, for the years ended\nDecember 31, 2016\n,\n2015\n, 2014, 2013 and 2012 (excluding mortgage loans held for sale).\n45\nTable of Contents\n(Dollars in thousands)\nCommercial\nReal  Estate\nLand\nDevelopment\nConsumer and\nSingle Family\nMortgages\nUnallocated\nTotal\nALLL for the year ended December 31, 2016.\nBalance at beginning of year\n$6,639\n$5,109\n$282\n$686\n$\u2014\n$12,716\nCharge offs\n(15,390\n)\n(1,119\n)\n\u2014\n(540\n)\n\u2014\n(17,049\n)\nRecoveries\n1,189\n1\n57\n17\n\u2014\n1,264\nProvision\n18,838\n235\n4\n479\n314\n19,870\nBalance at end of year\n$11,276\n$4,226\n$343\n$642\n$314\n$16,801\nAllowance for loan and lease losses as a percentage of average total loans\n1.96%\nAllowance for loan and lease losses as a percentage of total outstanding loans\n1.78%\nRatio of net charge-offs to average loans outstanding during the period\n1.84%\nALLL for the year ended December 31, 2015.\nBalance at beginning of year\n$7,670\n$5,133\n$296\n$734\n$\u2014\n$13,833\nCharge offs\n(2,643\n)\n\u2014\n(85\n)\n(199\n)\n\u2014\n(2,927\n)\nRecoveries\n1,798\n4\n\u2014\n8\n\u2014\n1,810\nProvision\n(186\n)\n(28\n)\n71\n143\n\u2014\n\u2014\nBalance at end of year\n$6,639\n$5,109\n$282\n$686\n$\u2014\n$12,716\nAllowance for loan and lease losses as a percentage of average total loans\n1.54%\nAllowance for loan and lease losses as a percentage of total outstanding loans\n1.48%\nRatio of net charge-offs to average loans outstanding during the period\n0.13%\nALLL for the year ended December 31, 2014.\nBalance at beginning of year\n$5,812\n$4,517\n$165\n$864\n$\u2014\n$11,358\nCharge offs\n(551\n)\n\u2014\n\u2014\n(102\n)\n\u2014\n(653\n)\nRecoveries\n1,467\n76\n\u2014\n85\n\u2014\n1,628\nProvision\n942\n540\n131\n(113\n)\n\u2014\n1,500\nBalance at end of year\n$7,670\n$5,133\n$296\n$734\n$\u2014\n$13,833\nAllowance for loan and lease losses as a percentage of average total loans\n1.73%\nAllowance for loan and lease losses as a percentage of total outstanding loans\n1.65%\nRatio of net charge-offs to average loans outstanding during the period\n(0.12\n)%\nALLL for the year ended December 31, 2013.\nBalance at beginning of year\n$6,340\n$3,487\n$248\n$806\n$\u2014\n$10,881\nCharge offs\n(5,945\n)\n(308\n)\n(5\n)\n(200\n)\n\u2014\n(6,458\n)\nRecoveries\n2,337\n5\n54\n34\n\u2014\n2,430\nProvision\n3,080\n1,333\n(132\n)\n224\n\u2014\n4,505\nBalance at end of year\n$5,812\n$4,517\n$165\n$864\n$\u2014\n$11,358\nAllowance for loan and lease losses as a percentage of average total loans\n1.59%\nAllowance for loan and lease losses as a percentage of total outstanding loans\n1.46%\nRatio of net charge-offs to average loans outstanding during the period\n0.56%\nALLL for the year ended December 31, 2012.\nBalance at beginning of year\n$8,908\n$5,777\n$316\n$626\n$\u2014\n$15,627\nCharge offs\n(6,664\n)\n(1,184\n)\n(158\n)\n(568\n)\n\u2014\n(8,574\n)\nRecoveries\n1,657\n198\n\u2014\n23\n\u2014\n1,878\nProvision\n2,439\n(1,304\n)\n90\n725\n\u2014\n1,950\nBalance at end of year\n$6,340\n$3,487\n$248\n$806\n$\u2014\n$10,881\nAllowance for loan and lease losses as a percentage of average total loans\n1.56%\nAllowance for loan and lease losses as a percentage of total outstanding loans\n1.49%\nRatio of net charge-offs to average loans outstanding during the period\n0.96%\n46\nTable of Contents\nThe ALLL\nincreased\n$4.1 million\nfrom\nDecember 31, 2015\nto\nDecember 31, 2016\nprimarily as a result of new loan growth and charge offs exceeding recoveries during that same period.\nWe classify our loan portfolios using asset quality ratings.

We project the future sources and uses of funds and maintain liquid funds for unanticipated events. Our primary sources of cash include cash we have on deposit at other financial institutions, payments from borrowers on their loans, proceeds from sales or maturities of securities held for sale, sales of residential mortgage loans, increases in deposits and increases in borrowings principally from the FHLB. The primary uses of cash include funding new loans and making advances on existing lines of credit, purchasing investments, including securities available for sale, funding new residential mortgage loans, funding deposit withdrawals and paying operating expenses. We maintain funds in overnight federal funds and other short-term investments to provide for short-term liquidity needs. We also have obtained credit lines from the FHLB and other financial institutions to meet any additional liquidity requirements we might have. See \"\u2014\nContractual Obligations\n\u2014\nBorrowings\n\" below for additional information related to our borrowings from the FHLB.\nOur liquid assets, which included cash and due from banks, federal funds sold, interest earning deposits that we maintain with financial institutions and unpledged securities available for sale (excluding Federal Reserve Bank and FHLB stock) totaled\n$161.6 million\n, which represented\n14%\nof total assets, at\nDecember 31, 2016\n. We believe that our cash and cash equivalent resources, together with available borrowings under our credit facilities, will be sufficient to meet normal operating requirements for at least the next twelve months, including to enable us to meet any increase in deposit withdrawals that might occur in the foreseeable future.\nCash Flow Provided by Operating Activities\n. In\n2016\n, operating activities provided net cash of\n$4.3 million\nprimarily attributable to non-cash adjustments to our net loss, which primarily resulted from the provision for loan and lease losses and the valuation allowance established on our deferred tax asset during the year ended December 31, 2016. In\n2015\n, operating activities provided net cash of\n$1.9 million\nprimarily attributable to net income of $12.4 million, partially offset by the reversal of our deferred tax asset valuation allowance of $11.6 million.\nCash Flow Used in Investing Activities\n. In\n2016\n, investing activities used net cash of\n$92.3 million\n, primarily attributable to\n$101.3 million\nused to fund an increase in loans, partially offset by\n$8.2 million\nof cash from maturities of and principal payments on securities available for sale, a\n$996 thousand\ndecrease in our interest bearing time deposits with financial institutions and\n$757 thousand\nof proceeds from sales of OREO. In\n2015\n, investing activities used net cash of\n$14.4 million\n, primarily attributable to\n$25.2 million\nused to fund an increase in loans, partially offset by $8.4 million of cash from maturities of and principal payments on securities available for sale, $2.1 million of cash from principal payments on other investments and\n$1.2 million\nof proceeds from sales of OREO.\nCash Flow Provided by (Used in) Financing Activities\n. In\n2016\n, financing activities provided net cash of\n$112.9 million\n, consisting primarily of a\n$82.9 million\nnet increase in noninterest bearing deposits and a\n$24.6 million\nnet increase in interest bearing deposits, which resulted from a decision to increase our core deposit base, and a $5.0 million net increase in borrowings. In\n2015\n, financing activities used net cash of\n$50.8 million\n, consisting primarily of a $34.7 million net decrease in interest bearing deposits, which resulted from a decision to increase our core deposit base, which included the transition of a portion of our certificates of deposit customers to savings account customers, and a $29.5 million decrease in borrowings, partially offset by an increase in noninterest bearing deposits of $12.2 million.\nRatio of Loans to Deposits\n. The relationship between gross loans and total deposits can provide a useful measure of a bank\u2019s liquidity. Since repayment of loans tends to be less predictable than the maturity of investments and other liquid resources, the higher the loan-to-deposit ratio the less liquid are our assets. On the other hand, since we realize greater yields on loans than we do on investments, a lower loan-to-deposit ratio can adversely affect interest income and earnings. As a result, our goal is to achieve a loan-to-deposit ratio that appropriately balances the requirements of liquidity and the need to generate a fair return on our assets. At\nDecember 31, 2016\nand\n2015\n, the loan-to-deposit ratio was\n95%\nand\n96%\n, respectively.\nCapital Resources\nRegulatory Capital Requirements Applicable to Banking Institutions\nUnder federal banking regulations that apply to all United States based bank holding companies and federally insured banks, the Company (on a consolidated basis) and the Bank (on a stand-alone basis) must meet specific capital adequacy requirements that, for the most part, involve quantitative measures, primarily in terms of the ratios of their capital to their assets, liabilities, and certain off-balance sheet items, calculated under regulatory accounting practices. Under those regulations, each bank holding company must meet a minimum capital ratio and each federally insured bank is determined by its primary federal bank regulatory agency to come within one of the following capital adequacy categories on the basis of its capital ratios.\n\u2022\nwell capitalized\n49\nTable of Contents\n\u2022\nadequately capitalized\n\u2022\nundercapitalized\n\u2022\nsignificantly undercapitalized; or\n\u2022\ncritically undercapitalized\nCertain qualitative assessments also are made by a banking institution\u2019s primary federal regulatory agency that could lead the agency to determine that the banking institution should be assigned to a lower capital category than the one indicated by the quantitative measures used to assess the institution\u2019s capital adequacy. At each successive lower capital category, a banking institution is subject to greater operating restrictions and increased regulatory supervision by its federal bank regulatory agency.\nQuantitative measures established by regulation to ensure capital adequacy require the Company and Bank to maintain minimum amounts and ratios (set forth in the following table) of total capital, common equity Tier 1 capital and Tier I capital (as defined in the regulations) to risk-weighted assets (as defined), and of Tier I capital (as defined) to average assets (as defined). We believe that, as of\nDecember 31, 2016\n, the Company and the Bank met all capital adequacy requirements to which they are subject and have not been notified by any regulatory agency that would require the Company or the Bank to maintain additional capital.\nThe actual capital amounts and ratios of the Company and the Bank at\nDecember 31, 2016\nare presented in the following table.\nApplicable Federal Regulatory Requirement\nAt December 31, 2016\nActual Capital\nFor Capital Adequacy Purposes\nTo be Categorized As Well Capitalized\nAmount\nRatio\nAmount\nRatio\nAmount\nRatio\n(Dollars in thousands)\nTotal Capital to Risk Weighted Assets.\nCompany\n$131,043\n12.8%\n$88,230\nAt least 8.625\nN\/A\nN\/A\nBank\n114,412\n11.4%\n86,566\nAt least 8.625\n$100,366\nAt least 10.0\nCommon Equity Tier 1 Capital to Risk Weighted Assets.\nCompany\n101,199\n9.9%\n52,427\nAt least 5.125\nN\/A\nN\/A\nBank\n101,807\n10.1%\n51,438\nAt least 5.125\n65,238\nAt least 6.5\nTier 1 Capital to Risk Weighted Assets.\nCompany\n$118,199\n11.6%\n$67,771\nAt least 6.625\nN\/A\nN\/A\nBank\n101,807\n10.1%\n66,492\nAt least 6.625\n$80,293\nAt least 8.0\nTier 1 Capital to Average Assets.\nCompany\n$118,199\n10.5%\n$44,923\nAt least 4.0\nN\/A\nN\/A\nBank\n101,807\n9.2%\n44,360\nAt least 4.0\n$55,450\nAt least 5.0\nAs the above table indicates, at\nDecember 31, 2016\n, the Bank (on a stand-alone basis) qualified as a \u201cwell\u2014capitalized\u201d institution, and the capital ratios of the Company (on a consolidated basis) exceeded the capital ratios mandated for bank holding companies, under federally mandated capital standards and federally established prompt corrective action regulations. Since\nDecember 31, 2016\n, there have been no events or circumstances known to us which have changed or which are expected to result in a change in the Company\u2019s or the Bank\u2019s classification as well-capitalized institutions.\nIn early July 2013, the Federal Reserve Board and the FDIC issued final rules implementing the Basel III regulatory capital framework and related Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act changes.  The rules revise minimum capital requirements and adjust prompt corrective action thresholds.  The final rules revise the regulatory capital elements, add a new common equity Tier 1 capital ratio, increase the minimum Tier 1 capital ratio requirement, and implement a new capital conservation buffer.  The rules also permit certain banking organizations to retain, through a one-time election, the existing treatment for accumulated other comprehensive income.  The final rules took effect for community banks on January 1, 2015, subject to a transition period for certain parts of the rules.  At\nDecember 31, 2016\nthe Bank (on a stand-alone basis) continued to qualify as a well-capitalized institution, and the Company continued to exceed the minimum required capital ratios applicable to it, under the capital adequacy guidelines described above.\nThe consolidated total capital and Tier 1 capital of the Company at\nDecember 31, 2016\nincludes an aggregate of\n$17.0 million\nprincipal amount of the\n$17.5 million\nof 30-year junior subordinated debentures that we issued in 2002 and 2004 (the\n50\nTable of Contents\n\u201cDebentures\u201d). See \u201c\u2014\nContractual Obligations\u2014Junior Subordinated Debentures\n\u201d below for additional information. We contributed the net proceeds from the sales of the Debentures to the Bank, thereby providing it with additional cash to fund the growth of its banking operations and, at the same time, to increase its total capital and Tier 1 capital.\nQuarterly interest payments on the Debentures require prior approval of the FRBSF. As of\nDecember 31, 2016\n, we were current on all interest payments.\nDividend Policy and Share Repurchase Programs.\nIt is, and since the beginning of 2009 it has been, the policy of the Boards of Directors of the Company and the Bank to preserve cash to enhance our capital positions and the Bank's liquidity. In addition, we have agreed that the Bank will not, without the FRB and the CDBO's prior written approval, pay any dividends to Bancorp. Accordingly, we do not expect to pay dividends or make share repurchases for the foreseeable future.\nThe principal source of cash available to a bank holding company consists of cash dividends from its bank subsidiaries. There are currently several restrictions on the Bank\u2019s ability to pay us cash dividends. Government regulations, including the laws of the State of California, as they pertain to the payment of cash dividends by California state chartered banks, limits the amount of funds that the Bank is permitted to dividend to us. Further, Section 23(a) of the Federal Reserve Act limits the amounts that a bank may loan to its bank holding company to an aggregate of no more than 10% of the bank subsidiary\u2019s capital surplus and retained earnings and requires that such loans be secured by specified assets of the bank holding company. We have committed to obtaining approval from the FRB and the CDBO prior to Bancorp paying any dividends, or make any distributions representing interest, principal or other sums on subordinated debentures or trust preferred securities. There can be no assurance that our regulators will approve such payments or dividends in the future. Refer to \u201c\nRegulatory Matters\n\u201d above in Item 1 and\nNote 14, Shareholders' Equity\nin the notes to our consolidated financial statements for more detail regarding the regulatory restrictions on our and the Bank's ability to pay dividends. While restrictions on the payment of dividends from the Bank to us exist, there are no restrictions on the dividends that PMAR may pay us. PMAR has approximately\n$15.0 million\nin assets and could provide us with additional cash if required. In addition, we currently have sufficient cash on hand to meet our cash obligations. As a result, we do not expect that these restrictions will impact our ability to meet our cash obligations.\n51\nTable of Contents\nOff Balance Sheet Arrangements\nLoan Commitments and Standby Letters of Credit\n. To meet the financing needs of our customers in the normal course of business, we are a party to financial instruments with off-balance sheet risk. These financial instruments include commitments to extend credit and standby letters of credit. At\nDecember 31, 2016\nand\n2015\n, we were committed to fund certain loans including letters of credit amounting to approximately\n$317 million\nand\n$193 million\n, respectively.\nCommitments to extend credit and standby letters of credit generally have fixed expiration dates or other termination clauses and the customer may be required to pay a fee and meet other conditions in order to draw on those commitments or standby letters of credit. We expect, based on historical experience, that many of the commitments will expire without being drawn upon and, therefore, the total commitment amounts do not necessarily represent future cash requirements.\nTo varying degrees, commitments to extend credit involve elements of credit and interest rate risk for us that are in excess of the amounts recognized in our balance sheets. Our maximum exposure to credit loss in the event of nonperformance by the customers to whom such commitments are made could potentially be equal to the amount of those commitments. As a result, before making such a commitment to a customer, we evaluate the customer\u2019s creditworthiness using the same underwriting standards that we would apply if we were approving loans to the customer. In addition, we often require the customer to secure its payment obligations for amounts drawn on such commitments with collateral such as accounts receivable, inventory, property, plant and equipment, income-producing commercial properties, residential properties and properties under construction. As a consequence, our exposure to credit and interest rate risk on such commitments is not different in character or amount than risks inherent in the outstanding loans in our loan portfolio.\nStandby letters of credit are conditional commitments issued by the Bank to guarantee a payment obligation of a customer to a third party. The credit risk involved in issuing letters of credit is essentially the same as that involved in extending loan commitments to customers.\nContractual Obligations\nThe following table summarizes the contractual obligations as of\nDecember 31, 2016\n.\nMaturity\/Obligation by Period\nTotal\nLess than 1 year\n1 - 3 years\n3 - 5 years\nMore than 5 years\n(Dollars in thousands)\nDeposits\n$1,001,300\n$957,572\n$43,413\n$315\n$\u2014\nFHLB Borrowings\n15,000\n15,000\n\u2014\n\u2014\n\u2014\nJunior Subordinated Debentures\n17,527\n\u2014\n\u2014\n\u2014\n17,527\nOperating Leases\n7,535\n2,463\n4,066\n1,006\n\u2014\nTotal\n$1,041,362\n$975,035\n$47,479\n$1,321\n$17,527\nThe table above excludes unrecognized tax benefits because we are unable to reasonably estimate the period during which this obligation may be incurred, if at all.

At\nDecember 31, 2016\n,\n$527 million\nof loans were pledged to secure our FHLB borrowings and to support our unfunded borrowing capacity. At\nDecember 31, 2016\n, we had unused borrowing capacity of\n$272 million\nwith the FHLB.\nThe highest amount of borrowings outstanding at any month-end during the year ended\nDecember 31, 2016\nwas\n$15 million\n, which consisted of borrowings from the FHLB. By comparison, the highest amount of borrowings outstanding at any month end in\n2015\nconsisted of\n$39.5 million\nof borrowings from the FHLB.\nJunior Subordinated Debentures\n. Pursuant to rulings of the FRB, bank holding companies were permitted to issue long term subordinated debt instruments that, subject to certain conditions, would qualify as and, therefore, augment capital for regulatory purposes. At\nDecember 31, 2016\n, we had outstanding approximately\n$17.5 million\nprincipal amount of 30-year junior subordinated floating rate debentures (the \u201cDebentures\u201d).\n52\nTable of Contents\nSet forth below is certain information regarding the Debentures.\nOriginal Issue Dates\nPrincipal Amount\nInterest Rates\nMaturity Dates\nSeptember 2002\n$7,217\nLIBOR plus 3.40%\nSeptember 2032\nOctober 2004\n10,310\nLIBOR plus 2.00%\nOctober 2034\nTotal\n$17,527\n(1)\nSubject to the receipt of prior regulatory approval, we may redeem the Debentures, in whole or in part, without premium or penalty, at any time prior to maturity.\nThese Debentures require quarterly interest payments, which are used to make quarterly distributions required to be paid on the corresponding trust preferred securities. Subject to certain conditions, we have the right, at our discretion, to defer those interest payments, and the corresponding distributions on the trust preferred securities, for up to five years. Exercise of this deferral right does not constitute a default of our obligations to pay the interest on the Debentures or the corresponding distributions that are payable on the trust preferred securities. We have committed to obtaining approval from the FRB and the CDBO prior to making any distributions representing interest, principal or other sums on subordinated debentures or trust preferred securities. Refer to \u201c\nRegulatory Matters\n\u201d above in Item 1 for further detail. As of\nDecember 31, 2016\n, we were current on all interest payments. There can be no assurance that our regulators will approve such payments in the future.\nOperating Lease Obligations\n. We lease certain facilities and equipment under various non-cancelable operating leases, which include escalation clauses ranging between\n2%\nand\n6%\nper annum.

Credit risk primarily exists in our loan and investment portfolio. The degree of credit risk will vary based on many factors including the duration of the transaction, the financial capacity of the client, the contractual terms of the agreement and the availability and quality of collateral.  We manage credit risk by limiting the total amount of credit extended to a single borrower relationship, by verification of its business operations and assets and with a thorough understanding of the nature and scope of the business activities in which they are engaged.\nAs appropriate, management and Board level committees evaluate and approve credit standards and oversee the credit risk management function related to loans and investments. These committees\u2019 primary responsibilities include ensuring the adequacy of our credit risk management infrastructure, overseeing credit risk management strategies and methodologies,\n53\nTable of Contents\nmonitoring economic and market conditions that may impact our credit-related activities, and finally, evaluating and monitoring overall portfolio credit risk.\nWe maintain a comprehensive credit policy that includes specific underwriting guidelines as well as standards for loan origination and reporting as well as portfolio management.  The credit policy is developed by credit management and approved by the Board of Directors, which also reviews it at least annually.  In addition, the credit policy sets forth requirements that ensure compliance with all applicable laws and regulatory guidance.\nOur underwriting guidelines outline specific standards and risk management criteria for each lending product offered. Loan types are further segmented into subsections where the inherent credit risk warrants detailed transaction and monitoring parameters, as follows.\n\u2022\nLoan structures, which includes the lien priority, amortization terms and loan tenors;\n\u2022\nCollateral requirements, coverage margins and valuation methods;\n\u2022\nUnderwriting considerations which include recommended due diligence and verification requirements; and\n\u2022\nSpecific credit performance standards. Examples include minimum debt service coverage ratios, liquidity requirements as well as limits on financial leverage.\nWe measure and document each loan\u2019s compliance with our policy criteria at underwriting. If an exception to these criteria exists, an explanation of the factors that mitigate this additional risk is considered before an approval is granted.  A report of loans with policy exceptions is reported to the Credit Policy Committee of the Board of Directors of the Bank on a monthly basis.\nWe continuously monitor a client\u2019s ability to perform under its obligations. Reporting requirements and loan covenants are set forth in each loan approval and compliance with these items are monitored on at least an annual basis or more frequently as conditions warrant.  Loan covenant compliance is tracked and results are reported to credit management.\nUnder our credit risk management structure, each loan is assigned an internal asset quality rating that is based on defined credit standards. While the criteria may vary by product, each rating focuses on the borrower\u2019s inherent operating risks, the quality of management, historical financial performance, financial capacity, the stability of profits and cash flow, and the adequacy of the secondary repayment sources. Asset quality ratings for each loan are monitored and reassessed on an ongoing basis. If necessary, ratings are adjusted to reflect changes in the client's financial condition, cash flow, financial position, or the absence of current financial information.  During the third quarter of 2016, our Credit Administration, along with three independent loan review firms, completed a comprehensive review of our commercial and commercial real estate loan portfolio.  This review culminated in the downgrading of approximately $48 million in credits, of which $38 million were classified credits.  Approximately 86% of these credit downgrades involved loans that were performing.  We also completed a re\u2013organization and centralization of our loan portfolio monitoring function at the end of the third quarter of 2016, which we believe will improve our loan portfolio monitoring capabilities in future periods. Of the $48 million in loan downgrades during the third quarter of 2016, $13.7 million in principal payments were received and $2.2 million in loan upgrades were made during the fourth quarter of 2016.  This represents a 33% reduction and improvement from September 30, 2016,\nleaving $32 million in loan downgrades taken in the third quarter of 2016 that we continue to manage and currently anticipate being paid down or upgraded by the middle of 2017.\nRefer to \u201c\nFinancial Condition \u2014 Allowance for Loan and Lease Losses\n\u201d above in this Item 7 for further detail regarding our internal asset quality ratings.\nThe Bank recognizes that substantial risks are posed by concentrations of credit assets.  As such, it seeks to maintain a diversified loan portfolio by limiting exposures by loan structure, business type or purpose, collateral type, and perceived asset quality.  Credit management defines areas of concentration, recommends appropriate thresholds to the Board of Directors and takes action if needed to manage potential risk where asset concentrations exist.\nMarket Risk\nMarket risk is the risk that values of assets and liabilities or revenues will be adversely affected by changes in market conditions such as interest rate fluctuations. This risk is inherent in the financial instruments associated with our operations and\/or activities, including loans, securities and short-term borrowings.\nThe primary market risk to which we are exposed is interest rate risk, which is inherent in the financial instruments associated with our operations, primarily including our loans, deposits and borrowings. Interest rate risk is the exposure of a company\u2019s financial condition, both earnings and the market value of assets and liabilities, to adverse movements in interest rates.  Interest rate risk results from differences in the maturity or timing of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities, changes in the slope of the yield curve over time, imperfect correlation in the adjustment of rates earned and paid on different instruments with otherwise similar characteristics (e.g. three-month Treasury bill versus three-month LIBOR) and from interest-rate-related options embedded in bank products (e.g. loan prepayments, floors and caps, callable investment securities, customers redeploying non-interest bearing to interest bearing deposits, etc.).\n54\nTable of Contents\nThe potential impact of interest rate risk is significant because of the liquidity and capital adequacy consequences that reduced earnings or net operating losses caused by a reduction in net interest income imply. We recognize and accept that interest rate risk is a routine part of bank operations and will from time to time impact our profits and capital position. The objective of interest rate risk management is to control exposure of net interest income to risks associated with interest rate movements in the market, to achieve consistent growth in net interest income and to profit from favorable market opportunities.\nWe measure interest rate risk and the effect of changes in market interest rates using a net interest income simulation analysis. The analysis incorporates our balance sheet as of\nDecember 31, 2016\nand assumptions that reflect the current interest rate environment. The analysis estimates the interest rate impact of a parallel increase in interest rates over a twelve-month horizon.\nThe analysis below incorporates our assumptions for the market yield curve, pricing sensitivities on loans and deposits, reinvestment of asset and liability cash flows, and prepayments on loans and securities. The new loans, investment securities, borrowings and deposits are assumed to have interest rates that reflect our forecast of prevailing market terms. We also assumed that LIBOR and prime rates do not fall below 0% for loans and borrowings. FHLB borrowings are assumed to convert to cash as they run off. Actual results may differ from forecasted results due to changes in market conditions as well as changes in management strategies.\nThe estimated changes in net interest income for a twelve-month period based on changes in the interest rates applied as of\nDecember 31, 2016\nwere as follows.\nChange in Market Interest Rates (basis points)\nAmount ($)\nPercent (%)\n(in thousands)\n+200\n$4,433\n10.90%\n+100\n2,192\n5.40%\n-100\n(3,722\n)\n(9.20\n)%\nIn addition to net interest income (\u201cNII\u201d) simulation, we measure the impact of market interest rate changes on our economic value of equity (\u201cEVE\u201d). EVE is defined as the net present value of assets, less the net present value of liabilities, adjusted for any off-balance sheet items.\nThe estimated changes in EVE in the following table are based on a discounted cash flow analysis which incorporates the impacts of changes in market interest rates. The model simulations and calculations are highly assumption-dependent and will change regularly as our asset\/liability structure changes, as interest rate environments evolve, and as we change our assumptions in response to relevant market or business circumstances. These calculations do not reflect the changes that we anticipate or may make to reduce our EVE exposure in response to a change in market interest rates as part of our overall interest rate risk management strategy. As with any method of measuring interest rate risk, certain limitations are inherent in the method of analysis presented in the preceding table. We are exposed to yield curve risk, prepayment risk and basis risk, which cannot be fully modeled and expressed using the above methodology. Accordingly, the results in the following table should not be relied upon as a precise indicator of actual results in the event of changing market interest rates. Additionally, the resulting changes in EVE and NII estimates are not intended to represent, and should not be construed to represent, the underlying value.\nThe estimated changes in EVE based on interest rates applied as of\nDecember 31, 2016\nwere as follows.\nChange in Market Interest Rates (basis points)\nAmount ($)\nPercent (%)\n(in thousands)\n+200\n$25,520\n17.40%\n+100\n12,496\n8.50%\n-100\n(4,458\n)\n(3.00\n)%\nCritical Accounting Policies\nOur consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States (\u201cGAAP\u201d) and general practices in the banking industry. Certain of those accounting policies are considered critical accounting policies, because they require us to make assumptions and judgments regarding circumstances or trends that could  affect the carrying value of our material assets, such as, for example, assumptions regarding economic conditions or trends that could impact our ability to fully collect our loans or ultimately realize the carrying value of certain of our other assets, such as securities available for sale and our deferred tax asset. Those assumptions and judgments are based on current information available\n55\nTable of Contents\nto us regarding those economic conditions or trends or other circumstances. If adverse changes were to occur in the conditions, trends or other events on which our assumptions or judgments had been based, then under GAAP it could become necessary for us to reduce the carrying values of any affected assets on our balance sheet. In addition, because reductions in the carrying value of assets are sometimes effectuated by or require charges to income, such reductions also may have the effect of reducing our income.\nOur critical accounting policies consist of the accounting policies and practices we follow in determining (i) the sufficiency of the allowance we establish for loan and lease losses, (ii) the fair values of our investment securities available for sale and financial instruments, and (iii) the amount of our deferred tax asset, consisting primarily of tax loss carryforwards and tax credits that we believe will be able to offset income taxes in future periods.\nAllowance for Loan and Lease Losses.\nWe maintain reserves to provide for loan and lease losses that occur in the ordinary course of the banking business. When it is determined that the payment in full of a loan has become unlikely, the carrying value of the loan is reduced (\"written down\") to what management believes is its realizable value or, if it is determined that a loan no longer has any realizable value, the carrying value of the loan is written off in its entirety (a loan \"charge-off\"). Loan charge-offs and write-downs are charged against our ALLL. The amount of the ALLL is increased periodically to replenish the ALLL after it has been reduced due to loan write-downs or charge-offs. The ALLL also is increased or decreased periodically to reflect increases or decreases in the volume of outstanding loans and to take account of changes in the risk of potential loan losses due to a deterioration or improvement in the condition of borrowers or in the value of properties securing non-performing loans or adverse changes or improvements in economic conditions. Increases in the ALLL are made through a charge, recorded as an expense in the statement of operations, referred to as the \"provision for loan and lease losses.\" Recoveries of loans previously charged-off are added back to and, therefore, to that extent increase the ALLL and reduce the amount of the provision for loan losses that might otherwise have had to be made to replenish or increase the ALLL. See \"\u2014Financial Condition\u2014Nonperforming Loans and the Allowance for Loan and Lease Losses\" above in this Item 7 for additional information regarding the ALLL.\nFair Value of Securities Available for Sale.\nUnder applicable accounting principles, we are required to recognize any unrealized loss or gain on the securities we hold for sale. An unrealized gain occurs when the fair value of a security available for sale increases above its amortized cost as recorded on our balance sheet. An unrealized loss occurs when the fair value of a security available for sale declines below its amortized cost as recorded on our balance sheet. As a result, we make determinations, on a quarterly basis, of the fair values of the securities available for sale in order to determine if there are any unrealized losses in those securities. When there is an active market for such a security, the determination of its fair value is based on market prices. If there is no active trading market, but such securities do trade from time to time, we rely primarily on quotes we obtain from third party vendors and securities brokers to determine the fair values of those securities. However, quotes are not always available for some securities and, in those instances, we make those fair value determinations on the basis of a variety of industry standard pricing methodologies, such as discounted cash flow analyses, matrix pricing, and option adjusted spread models, as well as fundamental analysis of the creditworthiness of the obligors under those securities. These methodologies require us to make various assumptions relating to such matters as future prepayment speeds, yield, duration, Federal Reserve Board monetary policies and the supply and demand for the individual securities. Consequently, if changes were to occur in market or other conditions or the circumstances on which our earlier assumptions or judgments were based, it could become necessary for us to reduce the fair values of such securities, which would result in charges to accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) on our balance sheet. Moreover, if we conclude that reductions in the fair values of any securities are other than temporary, it would be necessary for us to recognize an impairment loss to noninterest income in our statement of operations.\nFair Value of Financial Instruments.\nFASB ASC 820-10-35 defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value and outlines a fair value hierarchy based on the inputs to valuation techniques used to measure fair value. Fair value is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date (also referred to as an exit price). Fair value measurements are categorized into a three-level hierarchy based on the extent to which the measurement relies on observable market inputs in measuring fair value. Level 1, which is the highest priority in the fair value hierarchy, is based on unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities. Level 2 is based upon quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities. Level 3, which is the lowest priority in the fair value hierarchy, is based on unobservable inputs. Assets and liabilities are classified within this hierarchy in their entirety based on the lowest level of any input that is significant to the fair value measurement.\nThe use of fair value to measure our financial instruments is fundamental to our financial statements and is a critical accounting estimate because a substantial portion of our mortgage banking assets and liabilities (included in discontinued operations) are recorded at estimated fair value. Financial instruments classified as Level 3 are generally based on unobservable inputs, and the process to determine fair value is generally more subjective and involves a high degree of management judgment and assumptions. These assumptions may have a significant effect on our estimates of fair value, and the use of different assumptions, as well as changes in market conditions and interest rates, could have a material effect on our results of operations or financial condition.\n56\nTable of Contents\nUtilization and Valuation of Deferred Income Tax Benefits\n. We record as a \u201cdeferred tax asset\u201d on our balance sheet an amount equal to the tax credit and tax loss carryforwards and tax deductions (\u201ctax benefits\u201d) that we believe will be available to us to offset or reduce income taxes in future periods. Under applicable federal and state income tax laws and regulations, in most cases such tax benefits will expire, if they cannot be used, within specified periods of time. Accordingly, the ability to fully use our deferred tax asset to reduce income taxes in the future depends on the amount of taxable income that we generate during those time periods. At least once each year, or more frequently, if circumstances warrant, we make estimates of future taxable income that we believe we are likely to generate during those future periods. If we conclude, on the basis of those estimates and the amount of the tax benefits available to us, that it is more likely, than not, that we will be able to fully utilize those tax benefits prior to their expiration, we recognize the deferred tax asset in full on our balance sheet. On the other hand, if we conclude, instead, that it has become more likely, than not, that we will be unable to utilize those tax benefits in full prior to their expiration, then, we would establish, or increase any existing, reserves (commonly referred to as a \u201cvaluation allowance\u201d) to reduce the deferred tax asset on our balance sheet to the amount with respect to which we believe it is still more likely, than not, that we will be able to use to offset or reduce taxes in the future. The establishment of or an increase in that valuation allowance is implemented by recognizing a non-cash charge that would have the effect of increasing the provision, or reducing any credit, for income taxes that we would otherwise have recorded in our statements of operations. The determination of whether and the extent to which we will be able to utilize our deferred tax asset involves significant judgments and assumptions that are subject to period to period changes as a result of changes in tax laws, changes in market or economic conditions that could affect our operating results or variances between our actual operating results and the operating results that we had projected for any such period, as well as other factors.","48":"","49":"ITEM 7.    MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.\nThe following information should be read in conjunction with our Consolidated Financial Statements, including the notes thereto, included in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nOverview\nWe design, develop, manufacture, market and support software driven, three-dimensional (3D) measurement, imaging and realization systems.

Revenue related to these products is generally recognized upon shipment. In addition, we sell extended warranties and training and technology consulting services relating to our products. We recognize the revenue from extended warranties on a straight-line basis over the term of the warranty, and revenue from training and technology consulting services when the services are provided.\nWe operate in international markets throughout the world and maintain sales offices in Australia, Brazil, Canada, China, France, Germany, India, Italy, Japan, Malaysia, Mexico, the Netherlands, Poland, Portugal, Singapore, South Korea, Spain, Switzerland, Thailand, Turkey, the United Kingdom, the United States, and Vietnam.\nWe manufacture our FaroArm\n\u00ae\n, FARO Laser ScanArm\n\u00ae\n, FARO Gage\n\u00ae\n, and FARO Laser Tracker\nTM\nproducts in our manufacturing facility located in Switzerland for customer orders from the EMEA region, in our manufacturing facility located in Singapore for customer orders from the Asia-Pacific region, and in our manufacturing facilities located in Florida and Pennsylvania for customer orders from the Americas. We manufacture our FARO Focus and FARO Scanner Freestyle\n3D\nX\nproducts in our facilities located in Germany and Switzerland. We manufacture our FARO Laser Projection products in our facility located in Pennsylvania.  We expect all of our existing plants to have the production capacity necessary to support our volume requirements through 2017.\nWe account for wholly owned foreign subsidiaries in the currency of the respective foreign jurisdiction; therefore, fluctuations in exchange rates may have an impact on the value of the intercompany account balances denominated in different currencies and reflected in our condensed consolidated financial statements. We are aware of the availability of off-balance sheet financial instruments to hedge exposure to foreign currency exchange rates, including cross-currency swaps, forward contracts and foreign currency options. However, we have not used such instruments in the past, and none were utilized in\n2016\n,\n2015\nor\n2014.\n24\nTable of Contents\nExecutive Summary\nOur total sales in 2016\nincreased\n$8.1 million\n, or\n2.5%\n, to\n$325.6 million\nfor the year ended\nDecember 31, 2016\nfrom\n$317.5 million\nfor the year ended\nDecember 31, 2015\n.  This increase reflected improved service revenue compared with the prior year, offset by a decrease in product sales.  In 2016, we initiated a broad-reaching renewal of FARO to drive sales growth and increase operating efficiencies through several key initiatives. These initiatives include.\nGlobal reorganization\n\u2013\nIn 2016, we reorganized our business to align our sales, marketing, product management and R&D to specific vertical markets and better define our end market applications.  We believe this realignment will enable us to focus our product offerings and selling approach to meet the specific needs of our customers.  As a result of the reorganization, we realigned our business into the following three reporting segments, which incorporate our specific vertical markets.\n\u25e6\nFactory Metrology\n\u2013 provides solutions for manual and automated measurement and inspection in an industrial or manufacturing environment.

(\u201cBuildIT\u201d) \u2013 Located in Montreal, Canada, BuildIT specializes in process-configurable 3D metrology software solutions with hardware agnostic interfaces. The acquisition\n25\nTable of Contents\nenhances our Factory Metrology portfolio, providing customers greater software options to use in a variety of applications to reduce inspection and assembly times and increase productivity.\n\u25e6\nLaser Projection Technologies, Inc. (\u201cLPT\u201d) \u2013 Located in Londonderry, New Hampshire, LPT specializes in laser projection and measurement systems used throughout manufacturing environments around the globe to maximize productivity and efficiency. The acquisition enhances our portfolio of 3D measurement solutions and supports our long-term strategy to expand our presence in key markets.\n\u25e6\nMWF-Technology GmbH (\u201cMWF\u201d) \u2013 Located near Frankfurt, Germany, MWF is an innovator in mobile augmented reality solutions, with breakthrough technology that enables large, complex 3D CAD data to be transferred to a tablet device and then used for mobile visualization and comparison to real world conditions.  This enables real time, actionable manufacturing insight for in-process inspection, assembly, guidance and positioning.\nSales modernization\n\u2013 To support our future growth, we modernized our sales process by leveraging our current direct sales approach of on-site demonstrations with multimedia, web-based demonstrations and cloud-based customer relations development.\nGlobal harmonization\n\u2013 We reorganized all functions, processes and people to a harmonized global mindset from our historically regional business structure. The reorganization is expected to increase operating efficiency by harmonizing our global manufacturing and business support functions, including among other items, the implementation of uniform sales terms and conditions, global demonstration and service loaner inventory management, and a global human resources information system (HRIS).\nWe will continue to drive these initiatives though the 2017 fiscal year to achieve long-term growth and profitability.  Our ability to fully implement these initiatives to reorganize our business around certain vertical markets, modernize our sales processes to improve the efficiency of our sales organization, accelerate and maintain a consistent schedule of new product introductions, and harmonize our global functions to improve operational effectiveness is dependent upon a number of factors, including the continued improvements to our new ERP system, continued development of our products to maintain our technological advantage, and retention of key employees.\n26\nTable of Contents\nResults of Operations\n2016\nCompared to\n2015\nYears ended December 31,\n2016\n2015\nChange\n(dollars in millions)% of Sales% of Sales\n2016 vs 2015\nSales\n$325.6\n100.0%\n$317.5\n100.0%\n$8.1\nCost of sales\n147.6\n45.3%\n150.3\n47.3%\n(2.7\n)\nGross profit\n178.0\n54.7%\n167.2\n52.7%\n10.8\nOperating expenses\nSelling and marketing\n79.9\n24.5%\n79.8\n25.1%\n0.1\nGeneral and administrative\n40.8\n12.5%\n36.4\n11.5%\n4.4\nDepreciation and amortization\n13.9\n4.3%\n11.2\n3.5%\n2.7\nResearch and development\n30.1\n9.2%\n26.7\n8.4%\n3.4\nTotal operating expenses\n164.7\n50.6%\n154.1\n48.5%\n10.6\nOther expense (income)\n0.7\n0.2%\n0.3\n0.1%\n0.4\nIncome tax expense (benefit)\n1.5\n0.5%\n\u2014\n\u2014%\n1.5\nNet income\n$11.1\n3.4%\n$12.8\n4.0%\n$(1.7\n)\nConsolidated Results\nSales.\nTotal sales\nincreased\n$8.1 million\n, or\n2.5%\n, to\n$325.6 million\nfor the year ended\nDecember 31, 2016\nfrom\n$317.5 million\nfor the year ended\nDecember 31, 2015\n.  Our sales increase was primarily driven by higher service revenue and a modest increase in average selling prices, partially offset by a decrease in product sales.  Total product sales\ndecreased\nby\n$3.8 million\n, or\n1.5%\n, to\n$256.0 million\nfor the year ended\nDecember 31, 2016\nfrom\n$259.8 million\nfor the year ended\nDecember 31, 2015\n.  Our product sales decrease reflected a decline in unit sales partially offset by an increase in average selling prices in our products. Service revenue\nincreased\nby\n$11.9 million\n, or\n20.6%\n, to\n$69.6 million\nfor the year ended\nDecember 31, 2016\nfrom\n$57.7 million\nfor the year ended\nDecember 31, 2015\n, primarily due to an increase in warranty and customer service revenue driven by the growth of our installed, serviceable base and focused sales initiatives. Foreign exchange rates had a slightly negative impact on sales of $1.8 million, decreasing our overall sales growth by 0.6 percentage points, primarily due to the decline of the British pound sterling and the Chinese yuan renminbi relative to the U.S. dollar.\nGross profit.\nGross profit\nincreased\nby\n$10.8 million\n, or\n6.4%\n, to\n$178.0 million\nfor the year ended\nDecember 31, 2016\nfrom\n$167.2 million\nfor the year ended\nDecember 31, 2015\n. Gross margin increased to\n54.7%\nfor the year ended\nDecember 31, 2016\nfrom\n52.7%\nin the prior year period.  Gross margin from product revenue\nincreased\nby\n1.8\npercentage points to\n57.8%\nfor the year ended\nDecember 31, 2016\nfrom\n56.0%\nin the prior year period.  This increase was primarily due to higher average selling prices in our products and a lower write-down of inventory, partially offset by increased sales of service and demonstration inventory which results in lower gross margins. Gross margin from service revenue\nincreased\nby\n5.5\npercentage points to\n43.0%\nfor the year ended\nDecember 31, 2016\nfrom\n37.5%\nfor the prior year period, primarily due to higher warranty and customer service revenue.\nSelling and Marketing Expenses.\nSelling and marketing expenses were virtually flat year-over-year as a result of increased compensation expenses reflecting higher headcount, higher incentive compensation, and higher base salaries from a change in our commission structure as well as higher recruiting-related expense, almost entirely offset by lower costs resulting from not holding our annual sales meeting in 2016 and a decrease in commissions due to lower product sales and the change in\n27\nTable of Contents\nour commission structure.  Selling and marketing expenses as a percentage of sales were\n24.5%\nfor the year ended\nDecember 31, 2016\ncompared with\n25.1%\nfor the year ended\nDecember 31, 2015.\nSelling headcount is a key driver of our sales growth. We look at selling headcount from two perspectives: actual period-ending headcount and a time-weighted average experienced headcount, which we refer to as Full Time Experienced (\u201cFTE\u201d) headcount, over the trailing four quarters.  To determine selling FTE headcount, we discount the first year of a new employee by an experience factor to better correlate sales effectiveness with headcount, and we weight the number of months employed on a full-time or part-time basis.  Our worldwide selling actual period-ending headcount increased by 85, or 18.8%, to 536 at\nDecember 31, 2016\nfrom 451 at\nDecember 31, 2015\n.  Selling FTE headcount increased by 29, or 6.3%, to 486 at\nDecember 31, 2016\nfrom 457 at\nDecember 31, 2015.\nGeneral and administrative expenses.\nGeneral and administrative expenses\nincreased\nby\n$4.4 million\n, or\n12.2%\n, to\n$40.8 million\n, for the year ended\nDecember 31, 2016\nfrom\n$36.4 million\nfor the year ended\nDecember 31, 2015\n. The increase in general and administrative expenses was primarily driven by higher compensation expense due to higher headcount, higher incentive compensation, increased recruiting costs and higher costs related to businesses acquired, partially offset by lower year-over-year consulting fees. General and administrative expenses were\n12.5%\nof sales for the year ended\nDecember 31, 2016\ncompared to\n11.5%\nof sales in the prior year.\nDepreciation and amortization expenses.\nDepreciation and amortization expenses\nincreased\nby\n$2.7 million\n, or\n23.6%\n, to\n$13.9 million\nfor the year ended\nDecember 31, 2016\nfrom\n$11.2 million\nfor the year ended\nDecember 31, 2015\n, primarily due to increased depreciation for our new ERP system and service inventory that was transferred to fixed assets, as well as increased amortization of intangibles related to our prior and current year acquisitions.\nResearch and development expenses.\nResearch and development expenses\nincreased\n$3.4 million\n, or\n12.9%\n, to\n$30.1 million\nfor the year ended\nDecember 31, 2016\nfrom\n$26.7 million\nfor the year ended\nDecember 31, 2015\n. This increase was mainly due to higher project material costs and higher compensation expense resulting from increased engineering headcount in connection with our initiative to accelerate new product development and introductions, and an overall increase in incentive compensation. Research and development expenses as a percentage of sales increased to\n9.2%\nfor the year ended\nDecember 31, 2016\nfrom\n8.4%\nfor the year ended\nDecember 31, 2015.\nOther expense (income).\nOther expense increased by $0.4 million to $0.7 million for the year ended\nDecember 31, 2016\ncompared with $0.3 million for the year ended\nDecember 31, 2015\n. The increase was primarily driven by foreign exchange transaction losses resulting from the negative impact of changes in foreign exchange rates on the value of the current intercompany account balances of our subsidiaries denominated in other currencies.\nIncome tax (benefit) expense.\nIncome tax expense for the year ended\nDecember 31, 2016\nwas\n$1.5 million\ncompared with income tax benefit of\n$7,000\nfor the year ended\nDecember 31, 2015\n. This change was primarily the result of a shift in the distribution of profits and losses among our tax jurisdictions. Our effective tax rate was 12.0% for the year ended\nDecember 31, 2016\ncompared with (0.1%) in the prior year. Our effective tax rate continues to be lower than the statutory tax rate in the United States reflecting primarily our global footprint in foreign jurisdictions with lower tax rates. Our effective tax rate could be impacted positively or negatively by geographic changes in the manufacturing or sales of our products and a change in statutory tax rates in a jurisdiction, as well as the resulting effect on taxable income in each jurisdiction.\nNet income.\nNet income was\n$11.1 million\nfor the year ended\nDecember 31, 2016\ncompared with\n$12.8 million\nfor the year ended\nDecember 31, 2015\nreflecting the impact of the factors described above.\nSegment Results\nWe use segment profit to evaluate the performance of our reportable segments, which are Factory Metrology, Construction BIM-CIM and Other. Segment profit is calculated as gross profit, net of selling and marketing expenses, for the reporting segment. The discussion of segment results for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015 presented below is based on segment profit, as described above, and segment profit as a percent of sales, which is calculated as segment profit divided by net sales for such reporting segment. Our definition of segment profit may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies. For additional information, including a reconciliation of total segment profit to income from operations, see Note 17 to the \u201cNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\u201d included in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\n28\nTable of Contents\nFactory Metrology\n(dollars in millions)\nDecember 31, 2016\nDecember 31, 2015\nNet sales\n$236.3\n$222.7\nSegment profit\n$69.8\n$63.5\nSegment profit as a % of Sales\n29.5%\n28.5%\nSales.\nSales in our Factory Metrology segment\nincreased\n$13.6 million\n, or\n6.1%\n, to\n$236.3 million\nfor the year ended\nDecember 31, 2016\nfrom\n$222.7 million\nin the prior year primarily reflecting higher average selling prices and higher service revenue across all of our regions, partially offset by a decline in units sold mainly in the EMEA region. Foreign exchange rates had a negative impact on sales of $1.5 million, decreasing sales growth by 0.7 percentage points.\nSegment profit.\nSegment profit in our Factory Metrology segment\nincreased\n$6.3 million\n, or\n9.9%\n, to\n$69.8 million\nfor the year ended\nDecember 31, 2016\nfrom\n$63.5 million\nin the prior year.  This increase was primarily due to the increase in segment sales in addition to a higher write-down of inventory recorded in 2015 compared to 2016, partially offset by an increase in selling and marketing expenses reflecting higher headcount allocated to this segment partially offset by cost savings due to not holding the annual sales meeting in 2016.\nConstruction BIM-CIM\n(dollars in millions)\nDecember 31, 2016\nDecember 31, 2015\nNet sales\n$65.1\n$70.8\nSegment profit\n$18.3\n$16.3\nSegment profit as a % of Sales\n28.1%\n23.0%\nSales.\nSales in our Construction BIM-CIM segment\ndecreased\n$5.7 million\n, or\n8.1%\n, to\n$65.1 million\nfor the year ended\nDecember 31, 2016\nfrom\n$70.8 million\nin the prior year primarily reflecting a decline in units sold mostly in the Americas and the EMEA regions, partially offset by an increase in average selling prices and higher service revenue across all of our regions. Foreign exchange rates had a slightly negative impact on sales of $0.1 million, decreasing sales growth by 0.2 percentage points.\nSegment profit.\nSegment profit in our Construction BIM-CIM segment\nincreased\n$2.0 million\n, or\n12.3%\n, to\n$18.3 million\nfor the year ended\nDecember 31, 2016\nfrom\n$16.3 million\nin the prior year.  This increase was primarily due to the increase in service revenue, a slight decline in selling and marketing expenses reflecting cost savings due to not holding the annual sales meeting in 2016, and a higher write-down of inventory recorded in 2015 compared to 2016, partially offset by a decrease in product sales.\nOther\n(dollars in millions)\nDecember 31, 2016\nDecember 31, 2015\nNet sales\n$24.2\n$24.0\nSegment profit\n$10.0\n$7.6\nSegment profit as a % of Sales\n41.3%\n31.7%\nSales.\nSales in our Other segment\nincreased\n$0.2 million\n, or\n0.8%\n, to\n$24.2 million\nfor the year ended\nDecember 31, 2016\nfrom\n$24.0 million\nin the prior year primarily reflecting higher average selling prices mostly in the Americas region, and higher service revenue across all of our regions, partially offset by a decline in unit sales particularly in the EMEA region. Foreign exchange rates had a slightly negative impact on sales of $0.2 million, decreasing sales growth by 0.6 percentage points.\nSegment profit.\nSegment profit in our Other segment\nincreased\n$2.4 million\n, or\n31.6%\n, to\n$10.0 million\nfor the year ended\nDecember 31, 2016\nfrom\n$7.6 million\nin the prior year.  This increase was primarily due to a shift in our product and\n29\nTable of Contents\nservice sales mix resulting in higher gross margins, partially offset by an increase in selling and marketing expenses reflecting higher headcount and cost savings due to not holding the annual sales meeting in 2016.\n2015\nCompared to\n2014\nYears ended December 31,\n2015\n2014\nChange\n(dollars in millions)% of Sales% of Sales\n2015 vs 2014\nSales\n$317.5\n100.0%\n$341.8\n100.0%\n$(24.3\n)\nCost of sales\n150.3\n47.3%\n153.3\n44.9%\n(3.0\n)\nGross profit\n167.2\n52.7%\n188.5\n55.1%\n(21.3\n)\nOperating expenses\nSelling and marketing\n79.8\n25.1%\n80.8\n23.6%\n(1.0\n)\nGeneral and administrative\n36.4\n11.5%\n35.4\n10.4%\n1.0\nDepreciation and amortization\n11.2\n3.5%\n7.4\n2.2%\n3.8\nResearch and development\n26.7\n8.4%\n27.6\n8.1%\n(0.9\n)\nTotal operating expenses\n154.1\n48.5%\n151.2\n44.2%\n2.9\nOther expense (income)\n0.3\n0.1%\n(0.2\n)\n(0.1\n)%\n0.5\nIncome tax expense (benefit)\n\u2014\n\u2014%\n3.9\n1.1%\n(3.9\n)\nNet income\n$12.8\n4.0%\n$33.6\n9.8%\n$(20.8\n)\nConsolidated Results\nSales.\nTotal sales\ndecreased\n$24.3 million\n, or\n7.1%\n, to\n$317.5 million\nfor the year ended\nDecember 31, 2015\nfrom\n$341.8 million\nfor the year ended\nDecember 31, 2014\n.  The lower sales reflected a $24.3 million unfavorable impact of foreign exchange rates primarily due to a weakening of the Euro, Japanese yen and Brazilian real relative to the U.S. dollar.  Excluding the foreign exchange rate impact, sales for the year ended\nDecember 31, 2015\nwould have been about even compared with the year ended\nDecember 31, 2014\n.  Our sales results were primarily driven by a decline in product sales, offset by increased service revenue.  Total product sales\ndecreased\nby\n$24.3 million\n, or\n8.6%\n, to\n$259.8 million\nfor the year ended\nDecember 31, 2015\nfrom\n$284.1 million\nfor the year ended\nDecember 31, 2014\n.  Our product sales decrease was primarily driven by a decline in unit sales, partially offset by an increase in average selling prices as well as the favorable sales impact resulting from new product launches in 2015. Service revenue totaled\n$57.7 million\nfor both the years ended\nDecember 31, 2015\nand 2014, reflecting an increase in warranty revenue offset by the unfavorable impact from foreign exchange rates.\nGross profit.\nGross profit was\n$167.2 million\nfor the year ended\nDecember 31, 2015\ncompared with\n$188.5 million\nfor the year ended\nDecember 31, 2014\n. The decrease of\n$21.3 million\n, or\n11.3%\n, reflected primarily unfavorable foreign exchange rates, lower product sales and an increase in our inventory reserve recorded in the third quarter of 2015. Gross margin was\n52.7%\nfor the year ended\nDecember 31, 2015\ncompared with\n55.1%\nin the prior year. Gross margin from product sales was\n56.0%\nfor the year ended\nDecember 31, 2015\ncompared with\n59.4%\nin the prior year. This decrease was primarily the result of an increase in the inventory reserve and higher manufacturing costs as a percent of sales consistent with lower sales volume, partially offset by higher average selling prices.  Gross margin from service revenue\nincreased\nby\n3.5\npercentage points to\n37.5%\nfor the year ended\nDecember 31, 2015\nfrom\n34.0%\nfor the year ended\nDecember 31, 2014\n, primarily reflecting higher warranty revenue and lower service costs.\nSelling and Marketing Expenses.\nSelling and marketing expenses were\n$79.8 million\nfor the year ended\nDecember 31, 2015\ncompared with\n$80.8 million\nfor the year ended December 31, 2014. The lower selling and marketing\n30\nTable of Contents\nexpenses of $1.0 million, or 1.2%, primarily reflected lower sales commissions, partially offset by an increase in headcount driven by our two acquisitions completed in 2015.  Selling and marketing expenses as a percentage of sales increased to\n25.1%\nfor the year ended\nDecember 31, 2015\ncompared with\n23.6%\nfor the year ended\nDecember 31, 2014\nprimarily due to lower net sales.\nOur worldwide selling actual period-ending headcount increased by 17, or 3.9%, to 451 at\nDecember 31, 2015\nfrom 434 at\nDecember 31, 2014\n.  Selling FTE headcount increased by 44, or 10.6%, to 457 at\nDecember 31, 2015\nfrom 413 at\nDecember 31, 2014.\nGeneral and administrative expenses.\nGeneral and administrative expenses were\n$36.4 million\nfor the year ended\nDecember 31, 2015\ncompared with\n$35.4 million\nfor the year ended\nDecember 31, 2014\n. The increase in general and administrative expenses reflected primarily severance costs relating to cost reduction initiatives, as well as higher advisory and consulting fees to support our ERP implementation, acquisition expenses and other professional fees. General and administrative expenses as a percentage of sales increased to\n11.5%\nfor the year ended\nDecember 31, 2015\nfrom\n10.4%\nfor the year ended\nDecember 31, 2014.\nDepreciation and amortization expenses.\nDepreciation and amortization expenses were\n$11.2 million\nfor the year ended\nDecember 31, 2015\ncompared with\n$7.4 million\nfor the year ended\nDecember 31, 2014\n. This increase of\n$3.8 million\nreflected primarily our Exton facility, implementation of our ERP system, and amortization expense related to our recent acquisitions.\nResearch and development expenses.\nResearch and development expenses were\n$26.7 million\nfor the year ended\nDecember 31, 2015\ncompared with\n$27.6 million\nfor the year ended December 31, 2014. The lower expenses primarily reflected a reduction in high-cost contractor expenses, timing of product development activities, and the impact of favorable foreign exchange rates, partially offset by an impairment charge related to the discontinuation of a licensing agreement. Research and development expenses as a percentage of sales increased to\n8.4%\nfor the year ended\nDecember 31, 2015\nfrom\n8.1%\nfor the year ended\nDecember 31, 2014.\nOther expense (income).\nOther expense (income) changed by $0.5 million to $0.3 million of expense for the year ended\nDecember 31, 2015\ncompared with $0.2 million of income for the year ended\nDecember 31, 2014\n. The change was primarily driven by foreign exchange transaction losses resulting from changes in foreign exchange rates on the value of the current intercompany account balances of our subsidiaries denominated in other currencies.\nIncome tax expense (benefit).\nIncome tax benefit for the year ended\nDecember 31, 2015\nwas\n$7,000\ncompared with income tax expense of\n$3.9 million\nfor the year ended\nDecember 31, 2014\n. This change was primarily due to lower pre-tax income offset partially by a discrete tax benefit of $4.5 million related to the reversal of a valuation allowance in 2014. Our effective tax rate was (0.1%) for the year ended\nDecember 31, 2015\ncompared with 10.3% in the prior year. Our effective tax rate continues to be lower than the statutory tax rate in the United States primarily due to our global footprint in foreign jurisdictions with lower tax rates. In particular, the low tax rate recognized in 2015 primarily reflected higher operating income in jurisdictions like Switzerland and operating losses in our jurisdictions that have a higher statutory tax rate, such as the United States and Germany. Our effective tax rate could be impacted positively or negatively by geographic changes in the manufacturing or sales of our products and a change in statutory tax rates in a jurisdiction, as well as the resulting effect on taxable income in each jurisdiction.\nNet income.\nNet income was\n$12.8 million\nfor the year ended\nDecember 31, 2015\ncompared with\n$33.6 million\nfor the year ended\nDecember 31, 2014\nreflecting the impact of the factors described above.\nSegment Results\nFactory Metrology\n(dollars in millions)\nDecember 31, 2015\nDecember 31, 2014\nNet sales\n$222.7\n$246.2\nSegment profit\n$63.5\n$76.1\nSegment profit as a % of Sales\n28.5%\n30.9%\n31\nTable of Contents\nSales.\nSales in our Factory Metrology segment\ndecreased\n$23.5 million\n, or\n9.5%\n, to\n$222.7 million\nfor the year ended\nDecember 31, 2015\nfrom\n$246.2 million\nin the prior year. Foreign exchange rates had a negative impact on sales of $17.4 million, decreasing sales growth by 7.1 percentage points. The decrease in Factory Metrology sales primarily reflected a decline in unit sales across all of our regions and lower average selling prices in the EMEA and Asia-Pacific regions.\nSegment profit.\nSegment profit in our Factory Metrology segment\ndecreased\n$12.6 million\n, or\n16.6%\n, to\n$63.5 million\nfor the year ended\nDecember 31, 2015\nfrom\n$76.1 million\nin the prior year. This decrease was primarily due to unfavorable foreign exchange rates, lower product sales and an increase in our inventory reserve recorded in the third quarter of 2015, partially offset by a slight decrease in selling and marketing expenses due to lower sales commissions.\nConstruction BIM-CIM\n(dollars in millions)\nDecember 31, 2015\nDecember 31, 2014\nNet sales\n$70.8\n$75.4\nSegment profit\n$16.3\n$24.5\nSegment profit as a % of Sales\n23.0%\n32.5%\nSales.\nSales in our Construction BIM-CIM segment\ndecreased\n$4.6 million\n, or\n6.1%\n, to\n$70.8 million\nfor the year ended\nDecember 31, 2015\nfrom\n$75.4 million\nin the prior year period. Foreign exchange rates had a negative impact on sales of $5.9 million, decreasing sales growth by 7.8 percentage points. The decrease in Construction BIM-CIM sales primarily reflected a decline in units sold, mostly in the Americas and EMEA regions, partially offset by increased average selling prices in the Americas region as well as the favorable sales impact resulting from new product launches during the first quarter of 2015.\nSegment profit.\nSegment profit in our Construction BIM-CIM segment\ndecreased\n$8.2 million\n, or\n33.5%\n, to\n$16.3 million\nfor the year ended\nDecember 31, 2015\nfrom\n$24.5 million\nin the prior year. This decrease was primarily due to unfavorable foreign exchange rates, lower product sales, an increase in our inventory reserve recorded in the third quarter of 2015, and a slight increase in selling and marketing expenses driven by increased headcount and partially offset by lower sales commissions.\nOther\n(dollars in millions)\nDecember 31, 2015\nDecember 31, 2014\nNet sales\n$24.0\n$20.2\nSegment profit\n$7.6\n$7.1\nSegment profit as a % of Sales\n31.7%\n35.1%\nSales.\nSales in our Other segment\nincreased\n$3.8 million\n, or\n18.8%\n, to\n$24.0 million\nfor the year ended\nDecember 31, 2015\nfrom\n$20.2 million\nin the prior year. Foreign exchange rates had a negative impact on sales of $1.0 million, decreasing sales growth by 5.1 percentage points. The increase in sales for the Other segment primarily reflected increased unit sales and strong service revenue, particularly in the Americas region.\nSegment profit.\nSegment profit in our Other segment\nincreased\n$0.5 million\n, or\n7.0%\n, to\n$7.6 million\nfor the year ended\nDecember 31, 2015\nfrom\n$7.1 million\nin the prior year. This increase was primarily due to the increase in sales, partially offset by unfavorable foreign exchange rates and a slight increase in selling and marketing expenses driven by increased headcount and higher sales commissions.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nCash and cash equivalents\ndecreased\nby\n$1.2 million\nto\n$106.2 million\nat\nDecember 31, 2016\nfrom\n$107.4 million\nat\nDecember 31, 2015\n. The decrease was primarily driven by cash paid for acquisitions during the year ended December 31, 2016, mostly offset by improved cash flow from operations.\nCash flows from operating activities provide our primary source of liquidity. We generated positive cash flows from operations of\n$37.6 million\nduring the year ended\nDecember 31, 2016\ncompared to cash provided by operations of\n$28.0\n32\nTable of Contents\nmillion\nduring the year ended\nDecember 31, 2015\n. The increase was mainly due to lower inventory levels as well as the impact of prepaid expenses and other assets and accounts payable and accrued liabilities during the year ended\nDecember 31, 2016\ncompared with the year ended\nDecember 31, 2015.\nCash flows used in investing activities during the year ended\nDecember 31, 2016\nand\nDecember 31, 2015\nwere\n$37.1 million\nand\n$6.4 million\n, respectively. The increase in cash used in investing activities was primarily due to the change in proceeds from the sale of investments and the increase in cash paid as consideration for the three acquisitions completed during the year ended\nDecember 31, 2016\ncompared to the two acquisitions completed during the year ended\nDecember 31, 2015.\nCash flows provided by financing activities during the year ended\nDecember 31, 2016\nwere\n$0.2 million\ncompared with cash flows used in financing activities of\n$20.2 million\nduring the year ended\nDecember 31, 2015\n.  The change was primarily due to the repurchase of common stock during the year ended\nDecember 31, 2015.\nOf our cash and cash equivalents, $87.3 million was held by foreign subsidiaries as of\nDecember 31, 2016\n. Our current intent is to indefinitely reinvest these funds in our foreign operations, as the cash is needed to fund on-going operations. In the event circumstances change, leading to the conclusion that these funds will not be indefinitely reinvested, we would need to accrue at the time of such determination for the income taxes that would be triggered upon their repatriation.\nOn November 24, 2008, our Board of Directors approved a $30 million share repurchase program. Acquisitions for the share repurchase program may be made from time to time at prevailing prices as permitted by securities laws and other legal requirements, and subject to market conditions and other factors. The share repurchase program may be discontinued at any time. There is no expiration date or other restriction governing the period over which we can repurchase shares under the program. In October 2015, our Board of Directors authorized an increase to the existing share repurchase program from $30 million to $50 million.  We made no stock repurchases during the year ended December 31, 2016 and $22.8 million during the year ended December 31, 2015 under this program. As of December 31, 2016, we had authorization to repurchase $18.3 million remaining under the repurchase program.\nWe believe that our working capital and anticipated cash flow from operations will be sufficient to fund our long-term liquidity operating requirements for the foreseeable future.\nWe have no off balance sheet arrangements.\nContractual Obligations and Commercial Commitments\nWe are party to capital leases on equipment with an initial term of 36 to 60 months and other non-cancelable operating leases. These obligations are presented below as of December 31, 2016 (dollars in thousands).\nPayments Due by Period\nContractual Obligations\nTotal\n< 1 Year\n1-3 Years\n3-5 Years\n> 5 Years\nOperating lease obligations\n$23,363\n$6,620\n$8,573\n$3,653\n$4,517\nCapital lease obligations\n21\n8\n13\nPurchase obligations\n59,692\n29,380\n30,312\nOther obligations\n2,100\n2,100\nTotal\n$85,176\n$36,008\n$40,998\n$3,653\n$4,517\nWe enter into purchase commitments for products and services in the ordinary course of business. These purchases generally cover production requirements for 60 to 120 days as well as materials necessary to service customer units through the product lifecycle and for warranty commitments. As of December 31, 2016 we had approximately\n$29.4 million\nin purchase commitments that are expected to be delivered within the next 12 months.  To ensure adequate component availability in preparation for new product introductions, we also had $30.3 million in long-term commitments for purchases to be delivered after 12 months. Other obligations included in the table primarily represent estimated payments due for acquisition related earn-outs. We had a $0.3 million liability for unrecognized tax benefits that is excluded from the contractual obligations table due to the uncertainty of the period of settlement, if any, with the respective taxing authorities.\nInflation\nInflation did not have a material impact on our results of operations in recent years, and we do not expect inflation to have a material impact on our operations in 2017.\n33\nTable of Contents\nCritical Accounting Policies\nThe preparation of our consolidated financial statements requires our management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues, and expenses, as well as disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. We base our estimates on historical experience, along with various other factors believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Some of these judgments can be subjective and complex and, consequently, actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. While for any given estimate or assumption made by our management there may be other estimates or assumptions that are reasonable, we believe that, given the current facts and circumstances, it is unlikely that applying any such other reasonable estimate or assumption would materially impact the financial statements.\nIn response to the SEC\u2019s financial reporting release, FR-60, \u201cCautionary Advice Regarding Disclosure About Critical Accounting Policies,\u201d we have selected our critical accounting policies for purposes of explaining the methodology used in our calculation, in addition to any inherent uncertainties pertaining to the possible effects on our financial condition. The critical policies discussed below are our processes of recognizing revenue, the reserve for excess and obsolete inventory, income taxes, the reserve for warranties, goodwill impairment, business combinations and stock-based compensation. These policies affect current assets, current liabilities and operating results and are therefore critical in assessing our financial and operating status. These policies involve certain assumptions that, if incorrect, could have an adverse impact on our operations and financial position.\nRevenue Recognition\nRevenue is recognized when the price is fixed, collectability is reasonably assured, the title and risks and rewards of ownership have passed to the customer, and the earnings process is complete. Revenue related to our measurement, imaging, and realization equipment and related software is generally recognized upon shipment, as we consider the earnings process complete as of the shipping date. Fees billed to customers associated with the distribution of products are classified as revenue. We warrant our products against defects in design, materials and workmanship for one year. A provision for estimated future costs relating to warranty expense is recorded when products are shipped. We separately sell extended warranties. Extended warranty revenues are recognized on a straight-line basis over the term of the warranty. Costs relating to extended warranties are recognized as incurred. Revenue from sales of software only is recognized when no further significant production, modification or customization of the software is required and when the following criteria are met: persuasive evidence of a sales agreement exists, delivery has occurred, and the sales price is fixed or determinable and deemed collectible. These software arrangements generally include short-term maintenance that is considered post-contract support (\u201cPCS\u201d). We generally establish vendor-specific objective evidence (\u201cVSOE\u201d) of fair value for this PCS component based on our maintenance renewal rate. Maintenance renewals, when sold, are recognized on a straight-line basis over the term of the maintenance agreement. Revenues resulting from sales of comprehensive support, training and technology consulting services are recognized as such services are performed and are deferred when billed in advance of the performance of services. Revenues are presented net of sales-related taxes.\nReserve for Excess and Obsolete Inventory\nBecause the value of inventory that will ultimately be realized cannot be known with exact certainty, we rely upon both past sales history and future sales forecasts to provide a basis for the determination of the reserve. Inventory is considered potentially obsolete if we have withdrawn those products from the market or had no sales of the product for the past 12 months and have no sales forecasted for the next 12 months. Inventory is considered potentially excess if the quantity on hand exceeds 12 months of expected remaining usage. The resulting obsolete and excess parts are then reviewed to determine if a substitute usage or a future need exists. Items without an identified current or future usage are reserved in an amount equal to 100% of the first-in first-out (\u201cFIFO\u201d) cost of such inventory. Our products are subject to changes in technologies that may make certain of our products or their components obsolete or less competitive, which may increase our historical provisions to the reserve.\nIncome Taxes\nWe review our deferred tax assets on a regular basis to evaluate their recoverability based upon expected future reversals of deferred tax liabilities, projections of future taxable income over a two-year period, and tax planning strategies that we might employ to utilize such assets, including net operating loss carryforwards. Based on the positive and negative evidence of recoverability, we establish a valuation allowance against the net deferred assets of a taxing jurisdiction in which we operate, unless it is \u201cmore likely than not\u201d that we will recover such assets through the above means. In the future, our evaluation of the\n34\nTable of Contents\nneed for the valuation allowance will be significantly influenced by our ability to achieve profitability and our ability to predict and achieve future projections of taxable income over at least a two-year period.\nSignificant judgment is required in determining our worldwide provision for income taxes. In the ordinary course of operating a global business, there are many transactions for which the ultimate tax outcome is uncertain. We establish provisions for income taxes when, despite the belief that tax positions are fully supportable, there remain certain positions that do not meet the minimum probability threshold as described by Financial Accounting Standards Board (\u201cFASB\u201d) Accounting Standards Codification (\u201cASC\u201d) Topic 740,\nIncome Taxes\n, which is a tax position that is more likely than not to be sustained upon examination by the applicable taxing authority. In the ordinary course of business, we are examined by various federal, state, and foreign tax authorities. We regularly assess the potential outcome of these examinations and any future examinations for the current or prior years in determining the adequacy of our provision for income taxes. We assess the likelihood and amount of potential adjustments and adjust the income tax provision, the current tax liability and deferred taxes in the period in which the facts that gave rise to a revision become known.\nReserve for Warranties\nWe establish at the time of sale a liability for the one year warranty included with the initial purchase price of equipment, based upon an estimate of the repair expenses likely to be incurred for the warranty period. The warranty period is measured in installation-months for each major product group. The warranty reserve is included in accrued liabilities in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets. The warranty expense is estimated by applying the actual total repair expenses for each product group in the prior period and determining a rate of repair expense per installation-month. This repair rate is multiplied by the number of installation-months of warranty for each product group to determine the provision for warranty expenses for the period. We evaluate our exposure to warranty costs at the end of each period using the estimated expense per installation-month for each major product group, the number of units remaining under warranty, and the remaining number of months each unit will be under warranty. We have a history of new product introductions and enhancements to existing products, which may result in unforeseen issues that increase our warranty costs. While such expenses have historically been within expectations, we cannot guarantee this will continue in the future.\nGoodwill Impairment\nGoodwill represents the excess cost of a business acquisition over the fair value of the net assets acquired. We do not amortize goodwill; however, we perform an annual review in the fourth quarter of each year, or more frequently if indicators of potential impairment exist, to determine if the carrying value of the recorded goodwill or indefinite lived intangible assets is impaired. If an asset is impaired, the difference between the value of the asset reflected in the financial statements and its current fair value is recognized as an expense in the period in which the impairment occurs.\nEach period, and for any of our reporting units, we can elect to perform a qualitative assessment to determine whether it is necessary to perform the two-step quantitative goodwill impairment test. If we believe, as a result of our qualitative assessment, that it is not more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit containing goodwill is less than its carrying amount, then the first and second steps of the quantitative goodwill impairment test are unnecessary. If we elect to bypass the qualitative assessment option, or if the qualitative assessment was performed and resulted in the Company being unable to conclude that it is not more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit containing goodwill is greater than its carrying amount, we will perform the two-step quantitative goodwill impairment test. We perform the first step of the two-step quantitative goodwill impairment test by calculating the fair value of the reporting unit using a discounted cash flow method and market approach method, and then comparing the respective fair value with the carrying amount of the reporting unit. If the carrying amount of the reporting unit exceeds its fair value, we perform the second step of the quantitative goodwill impairment test to measure the amount of the impairment loss, if any. Management has concluded there was no goodwill impairment for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014.\nBusiness Combinations\nWe allocate the fair value of purchase consideration to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their fair values at the acquisition date. The excess of the fair value of purchase consideration over the fair value of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed is recorded as goodwill. When determining the fair values of assets acquired and liabilities assumed, management makes significant estimates and assumptions, especially with respect to intangible assets. Critical estimates in valuing intangible assets include, but are not limited to, expected future cash flows, which include consideration of future growth rates and margins, customer attrition rates, future changes in technology and brand awareness, loyalty and position, and discount rates. Fair value estimates are based on the assumptions management believes a market participant would use in\n35\nTable of Contents\npricing the asset or liability. Amounts recorded in a business combination may change during the measurement period, which is a period not to exceed one year from the date of acquisition, as additional information about conditions existing at the acquisition date becomes available.\nStock-Based Compensation\nWe measure and record compensation expense using the applicable accounting guidance for share-based payments related to stock options, restricted stock, and performance-based awards granted to our directors and employees. The fair value of stock options, including performance awards, without a market condition is determined by using the Black-Scholes option valuation model. The fair value of restricted stock awards and stock options with a market condition is estimated, at the date of grant, using the Monte Carlo Simulation valuation model. The Black-Scholes and Monte Carlo Simulation valuation models incorporate assumptions as to stock price volatility, the expected life of options or awards, a risk-free interest rate and dividend yield. In valuing our stock options, significant judgment is required in determining the expected volatility of our common stock and the expected life that individuals will hold their stock options prior to exercising. Expected volatility for stock options is based on the historical and implied volatility of our own common stock while the volatility for our restricted stock units with a market condition is based on the historical volatility of our own stock and the stock of companies within our defined peer group. The expected life of stock options is derived from the historical actual term of option grants and an estimate of future exercises during the remaining contractual period of the option. While volatility and estimated life are assumptions that do not bear the risk of change subsequent to the grant date of stock options, these assumptions may be difficult to measure as they represent future expectations based on historical experience. Further, our expected volatility and expected life may change in the future, which could substantially change the grant-date fair value of future awards of stock options and, ultimately, the expense we record. The fair value of restricted stock, including performance awards, without a market condition is estimated using the current market price of our common stock on the date of grant. Additionally, in calculating compensation expense for these awards, we are also required to estimate the extent to which awards will be forfeited prior to vesting. Many factors are considered when estimating expected forfeitures, including types of awards, employee class and historical experience. To the extent actual results or updated estimates of forfeiture differ from current estimates, such amounts are recorded as a cumulative adjustment to the previously recorded amounts.\nWe expense stock-based compensation for stock options, restricted stock awards, and performance awards over the requisite service period. For awards with only a service condition, we expense stock-based compensation, adjusted for estimated forfeitures, using the straight-line method over the requisite service period for the entire award. For awards with both performance and service conditions, we expense the stock-based compensation, adjusted for estimated forfeitures, on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period for each separately vesting portion of the award, taking into account the probability that we will satisfy the performance condition. Furthermore, we expense awards with a market condition over the three-year vesting period regardless of the value that the award recipients ultimately receive. Excess tax benefits are credited to additional paid-in capital when the deduction reduces cash taxes payable. When we have tax deductions in excess of the compensation cost, they are classified as financing cash inflows in the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows.\nImpact of Recently Issued Accounting Standards\nIn October 2016, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update (\u201cASU\u201d) No. 2016-16,\nIncome Taxes (Topic 740): Intra-Entity Transfers of Assets Other than Inventory\n(\u201cASU 2016-16\u201d), which removes the prohibition in ASC 740 against the immediate recognition of the current and deferred income tax effects of intra-entity transfers of assets other than inventory. This ASU requires the tax effects of intercompany transactions, other than sales of inventory, to be recognized when the transfer occurs, instead of deferred until the transferred asset is sold to a third party or otherwise recovered through use of the asset. The new guidance must be applied on a modified retrospective basis through a cumulative-effect adjustment directly to retained earnings as of the beginning of the period of adoption and is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2017, and interim period therein, with early adoption permitted. We do not expect the adoption of this guidance will have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.\nIn August 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-15,\nStatement of Cash Flows (Topic 230): Classification of Certain Cash Receipts and Cash Payments\n(\u201cASU 2016-15\u201d), which clarifies how companies present and classify certain cash receipts and cash payments in the statement of cash flows.  ASU 2016-15 is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2017, and interim periods therein. Early adoption is permitted. We do not expect the adoption of this guidance will have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.\nIn May 2014, the FASB issued ASU No. 2014-09,\nRevenue from Contracts with Customers: (Topic 606)\n(\u201cASU 2014-09\u201d), amending its accounting guidance related to revenue recognition. Under this ASU and subsequently issued amendments, revenue is recognized to depict the transfer of goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the\n36\nTable of Contents\nconsideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. Additional disclosures are required to provide the nature, amount, timing and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows arising from customer contracts, including significant judgments and changes in judgments and assets recognized from costs incurred to obtain or fulfill a contract. The ASU and subsequently issued amendments to the revenue recognition accounting guidance are effective for us on January 1, 2018 and permit the use of either the retrospective or cumulative effective transition method. We have not yet selected a transition method nor have we determined the effect of the revenue recognition accounting guidance on our ongoing financial reporting.\nIn March 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-09,\nCompensation \u2013 Stock Compensation (Topic 718): Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting\n(\u201cASU 2016-09\u201d), which is intended to simplify several aspects of the accounting for share-based payment transactions, including the income tax consequences, classification of awards as either equity or liabilities, and classification on the statement of cash flows. ASU 2016-09 became effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2016, and interim periods therein (our fiscal year 2017). We adopted ASU 2016-09 effective January 1, 2017. Under the new guidance, excess tax benefits that were not previously recognized because the related tax deduction had not reduced current taxes payable are to be recorded on a modified retrospective basis.  This is achieved through a cumulative-effect adjustment to retained earnings as of the beginning of the period in which the new guidance is adopted. Historically, we recognized all excess tax benefits when an option was exercised or a share vested since we did not have a U.S. net operating loss carryforward. Therefore, the tax benefit will be allowed under the current guidance and no adjustment to retained earnings is required.\nUnder the new guidance, all tax-related cash flows resulting from share-based payments are reported as operating activities in the statement of cash flows. Effective January 1, 2017, we adopted this portion of the guidance on a prospective basis.  This approach incorporates the net of the inflow and outflow from all tax-related cash flows resulting from share-based payments in the deferred income tax (benefit) expense line item and presents it along with other income tax cash flows as operating activities in the statement of cash flows.\nWe also elected to account for forfeitures related to the service condition-based awards as they occur effective January 1, 2017, which is a change from our treatment of estimating forfeitures in previous years. However, we continue to assess performance condition-based awards quarterly as required. In adopting the new policy using a modified retrospective approach, we assessed the cumulative effect adjustment and recorded to retaining earnings the difference between the amount of compensation cost previously recorded and the amount that would have been recorded without assuming forfeitures. The cumulative effect adjustment recorded to retained earnings was not material.  We will continue to assess the impact of the adopted guidance on a quarterly basis and do not expect the adoption of this guidance will have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.\nIn February 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-02,\nLeases (Topic 842)\n(\u201cASU 2016-02\u201d), which is intended to increase transparency and comparability among organizations by recognizing lease assets and lease liabilities on the balance sheet and disclosing key information about leasing arrangements to enable users of financial statements to assess the amount, timing, and uncertainty of cash flows arising from leases. ASU 2016-02 must be applied on a modified retrospective basis and is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018, and interim periods within those years, with early adoption permitted. We are evaluating the impact of adopting this standard on our consolidated financial statements and related disclosures.\nIn July 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-11,\nInventory (Topic 330): Simplifying the Measurement of Inventory\n(\u201cASU 2015-11\u201d), which changes the measurement principle for inventory from the lower of cost or market to the lower of cost and net realizable value. ASU 2015-11 defines net realizable value as estimated selling prices in the ordinary course of business, less reasonably predictable costs of completion, disposal, and transportation. The new guidance must be applied on a prospective basis and became effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2016 (our fiscal year 2017), and interim periods within those years, with early adoption permitted. We adopted ASU 2015-11 effective January 1, 2017.  The adoption of this standard did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.\n37\nTable of Contents","50":"","51":"","52":"","53":"","54":"","55":"ITEM 7.\nMANAGEMENT\u2019S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND\nRESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nYou should read the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations together with our financial statements and related notes appearing at the end of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Some of the information contained in this discussion and analysis or set forth elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, including information with respect to our plans and strategy for our business and related financing, includes forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. You should read the \u201cRisk Factors\u201d section of this report for a discussion of important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from the results described in or implied by the forward-looking statements contained in the following discussion and analysis.\nOverview\nWe are a biopharmaceutical company focused on acquiring, developing and commercializing innovative anti-cancer agents in the United States, Europe and additional international markets. We target our development programs for the treatment of specific subsets of cancer populations, and simultaneously develop, with partners, diagnostic tools intended to direct a compound in development to the population that is most likely to benefit from its use.\nOur commercial product Rubraca (rucaparib) is the first and only oral, small molecule poly ADP-ribose polymerase, or PARP, inhibitor of PARP1, PARP2 and PARP3 approved in the United States by the FDA as monotherapy for the treatment of patients with deleterious BRCA (human genes associated with the repair of damaged DNA) mutation (germline and\/or somatic) associated advanced ovarian cancer, who have been treated with two or more chemotherapies, and selected for therapy based on an FDA-approved companion diagnostic for Rubraca.\nThe MAA submission with the EMA for a comparable ovarian cancer indication was accepted by the EMA during the fourth quarter of 2016. Additionally, rucaparib is being studied as a potential maintenance therapy for ovarian cancer patients in the ARIEL3 trial. Data from ARIEL3 is anticipated in mid-2017.  Pending positive data from ARIEL3, we intend to follow up with a supplemental NDA for second-line maintenance therapy in women with ovarian cancer who have responded to platinum-based therapy.  Rucaparib is also being developed in patients with mutant BRCA tumors and other DNA repair deficiencies beyond BRCA \u2013 commonly referred to as homologous recombination deficiencies.  Studies open for enrollment or under consideration include prostate, breast, pancreatic, gastroesophageal, bladder and lung cancers.  We hold worldwide rights for rucaparib.\nIn addition, we have two other product candidates: lucitanib, an oral inhibitor of the tyrosine kinase activity of vascular endothelial growth factor receptors (VEGFR) 1-3, platelet-derived growth factor receptors (PDGFR) alpha and beta and fibroblast growth factor receptors (FGFR) 1-3, and rociletinib, an oral mutant-selective inhibitor of EGFR.  Clinical development for each of these candidates has ceased and we continue to provide drug to patients whose clinicians recommend continuing therapy. We maintain certain development and commercialization rights for lucitanib and global development and commercialization rights for rociletinib.\nWe commenced operations in April 2009. To date, we have devoted substantially all of our resources to identifying and in-licensing product candidates, performing development activities with respect to those product candidates and the general and administrative support of these operations. Through December 31, 2016, we have generated $13.6 million in license and milestone revenue related to our collaboration and license agreement with Servier and have generated $0.1 million product revenue related to sales of Rubraca, which we began to commercialize on December 19, 2016. We have principally funded our operations using the net proceeds from the sale of convertible preferred stock, the issuance of convertible promissory notes, public offerings of our common stock and our convertible senior notes offering.\nWe have never been profitable and, as of December 31, 2016, we had an accumulated deficit of $1,131.0 million. We incurred net losses of $349.1 million, $352.9 million and $160.0 million for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively, and had cash, cash equivalents and available-for-sale securities totaling $266.2 million at December 31, 2016.\nWe expect to incur significant losses for the foreseeable future, as we incur costs related to commercial activities associated with Rubraca. In January 2017, we sold 5,750,000 shares of our common stock in a public offering at $41.00 per share. The net proceeds from the offering were $221.2 million, after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and offering expenses. We intend to use the net proceeds of the offering for general corporate purposes,\n57\nTable of Contents\nincluding commercial planning and sales and marketing expenses associated with the launch of Rubraca in the United States and, if approved by the EMA, in Europe, funding of our development programs, selling, general and administrative expenses, acquisition or licensing of additional product candidates or businesses and working capital. Based on our current estimates, we believe that our cash, cash equivalents and available-for-sale securities will allow us to fund activities through at least the next 12 months. Until we can generate a sufficient amount of revenue from Rubraca, we expect to finance our operations in part through additional public or private equity or debt offerings and may seek additional capital through arrangements with strategic partners or from other sources.  Adequate additional financing may not be available to us on acceptable terms, or at all.  Our failure to raise capital as and when needed would have a negative impact on our financial condition and our ability to pursue our business strategy.  We will need to generate significant revenues to achieve profitability, and we may never do so.\nProduct License Agreements\nRucaparib\nIn June 2011, we entered into a license agreement with Pfizer Inc. to acquire exclusive global development and commercialization rights to rucaparib. The exclusive rights are exclusive even as to Pfizer and include the right to grant sublicenses. Pursuant to the terms of the license agreement, we made a $7.0 million upfront payment to Pfizer. In April 2014, we initiated a pivotal registration study for rucaparib, which resulted in a $0.4 million milestone payment to Pfizer as required by the license agreement. In September 2016, we made a milestone payment of $0.5 million to Pfizer upon acceptance of the NDA for rucaparib by the FDA. The MAA submission with the EMA for a comparable ovarian cancer indication was completed and accepted by the MAA during the fourth quarter of 2016, which resulted in a $0.5 million milestone payment to Pfizer as required by the license agreement. These payments were recognized as acquired in-process research and development expense.\nOn August 30, 2016, we entered into a first amendment to the worldwide license agreement with Pfizer, which amends the June 2011 existing worldwide license agreement to permit us to defer payment of the milestone payments payable upon (i) FDA approval of an NDA for 1\nst\nIndication in US and (ii) EMA approval of an MAA for 1\nst\nIndication in EU, to a date that is 18 months after the date of achievement of such milestones. In the event that we defer such milestone payments, we have agreed to certain higher payments related to the achievement of such milestones.\nOn December 19, 2016, the FDA approved Rubraca tablets as monotherapy for the treatment of patients with deleterious BRCA mutation (germline and\/or somatic) associated with advanced ovarian cancer, who have been treated with two or more chemotherapies, and selected for therapy based on FDA-approved companion diagnostic for Rubraca. The FDA approval resulted in a $0.75 million milestone payment to Pfizer as required by the license agreement. The FDA approval also resulted in the obligation to pay a $20.0 million milestone payment, for which we have exercised the option to defer payment by agreeing to pay $23.0 million within 18 months after the date of the FDA approval. These payments were recognized as intangible assets and amortized over the estimated remaining useful life of rucaparib.\nWe are obligated under the license agreement to use commercially reasonable efforts to develop and commercialize rucaparib and we are responsible for all remaining development and commercialization costs for rucaparib. We are required to make regulatory milestone payments to Pfizer of up to an additional $69.75 million in aggregate if specified clinical study objectives and regulatory filings, acceptances and approvals are achieved. In addition, we are obligated to make sales milestone payments to Pfizer if specified annual sales targets for rucaparib are met, the majority of which relate to annual sales targets of $500.0 million and above, which, in the aggregate, could amount to total milestone payments of $170.0 million, and tiered royalty payments at a mid-teen percentage rate on our net sales, with standard provisions for royalty offsets to the extent we need to obtain any rights from third parties to commercialize rucaparib.\nThe license agreement with Pfizer will remain in effect until the expiration of all of our royalty and sublicense revenue obligations to Pfizer, determined on a product-by-product and country-by-country basis, unless we elect to terminate the license agreement earlier. If we fail to meet our obligations under the agreement and are unable to cure such failure within specified time periods, Pfizer can terminate the agreement, resulting in a loss of our rights to rucaparib and an obligation to assign or license to Pfizer any intellectual property rights or other rights we may have in rucaparib, including our regulatory filings, regulatory approvals, patents and trademarks for rucaparib.\nIn April 2012, we entered into a license agreement with AstraZeneca UK Limited to acquire exclusive rights associated with rucaparib under a family of patents and patent applications that claim methods of treating patients with\n58\nTable of Contents\nPARP inhibitors in certain indications. The license enables the development and commercialization of rucaparib for the uses claimed by these patents. Pursuant to the terms of the license agreement, we made an upfront payment of $0.25 million upon execution of the agreement. During the second quarter of 2016, we made a milestone payment of $0.3 million to AstraZeneca upon the NDA submission for rucaparib. These payments were recognized as acquired in-process research and development expense. The FDA approval of rucaparib on December 19, 2016 resulted in a $0.35 million milestone payment to AstraZeneca as required by the license agreement. This payment was recognized as intangible assets and amortized over the estimated remaining useful life of rucaparib. AstraZeneca will also receive royalties on any net sales of rucaparib.\nLucitanib\nIn October 2008, EOS (now known as Clovis Oncology Italy S.r.l.) entered into an exclusive license agreement with Advenchen to develop and commercialize lucitanib on a global basis, excluding China. We are obligated to pay Advenchen tiered royalties at percentage rates in the mid-single digits on net sales of lucitanib, based on the volume of annual net sales achieved. In addition, after giving effect to the first and second amendments to the license agreement, we are required to pay to Advenchen 25% of any consideration, excluding royalties, we receive from sublicensees, in lieu of the milestone obligations set forth in the agreement. We are obligated under the agreement to use commercially reasonable efforts to develop and commercialize at least one product containing lucitanib, and we are also responsible for all remaining development and commercialization costs for lucitanib. In the first quarter of 2014, we recognized acquired in-process research and development expense of $3.4 million, which represents 25% of the sublicense agreement consideration of $13.6 million received from Servier upon the end of opposition and appeal of the lucitanib patent by the European Patent Office.\nThe license agreement with Advenchen will remain in effect until the expiration of all of our royalty obligations to Advenchen, determined on a product-by-product and country-by-country basis, unless we elect to terminate the agreement earlier. If we fail to meet our obligations under the agreement and are unable to cure such failure within specified time periods, Advenchen can terminate the agreement, resulting in a loss of our rights to lucitanib.\nIn September 2012, EOS entered into a collaboration and license agreement with Servier whereby EOS sublicensed to Servier exclusive rights to develop and commercialize lucitanib in all countries outside of the U.S., Japan and China. In exchange for these rights, EOS received an upfront payment of \u20ac45.0 million. We are entitled to receive additional payments upon achievement of specified development, regulatory and commercial milestones up to \u20ac100.0 million in the aggregate, \u20ac10.0 million of which was received in the first quarter of 2014. In addition, we are entitled to receive sales milestone payments if specified annual sales targets for lucitanib are met, which, in the aggregate, could total \u20ac250.0 million. We are also entitled to receive royalties on sales of lucitanib by Servier.\nWe and Servier are developing lucitanib pursuant to a development plan agreed to between the parties.\nServier is responsible for all of the global development costs for lucitanib up to \u20ac80.0 million. Cumulative global development costs in excess of \u20ac80.0 million, if any, will be shared equally between us and Servier. During the second quarter of 2016, we and Servier agreed to discontinue the development of lucitanib for breast cancer and lung cancer and are continuing to evaluate what, if any, further development of lucitanib will be pursued. Based on current estimates, we expect to complete the committed on-going development activities in 2017 and expect full reimbursement of our development costs from Servier. Reimbursements are recorded as a reduction to research and development expense on the Consolidated Statements of Operations.\nRociletinib\nIn May 2010, we entered into an exclusive worldwide license agreement with Celgene to discover, develop and commercialize a covalent inhibitor of mutant forms of the EGFR gene product. Rociletinib was identified as the lead inhibitor candidate under the license agreement. We are responsible for all non-clinical, clinical, regulatory and other activities necessary to develop and commercialize rociletinib.\nWe made an upfront payment of $2.0 million upon execution of the license agreement, a $4.0 million milestone payment in the first quarter of 2012 upon the acceptance by the FDA of our IND application for rociletinib and a $5.0 million milestone payment in the first quarter of 2014 upon the initiation of the Phase II study for rociletinib. In the third quarter of 2015, we made milestone payments totaling $12.0 million upon acceptance of the NDA and MAA for\n59\nTable of Contents\nrociletinib by the FDA and EMA, respectively. We recognized all payments prior to commercial approval as acquired in-process research and development expense.\nDuring the second quarter of 2016, we received a CRL from the FDA for the rociletinib NDA. The FDA issues a CRL to indicate that their review of an application is complete and that the application is not ready for approval. In anticipation of receiving the CRL, we terminated enrollment in all ongoing sponsored clinical studies, although we continue to provide drug to patients whose clinicians recommend continuing rociletinib therapy. In addition, we withdrew our MAA for rociletinib on file with the EMA. We are continuing analyses of rociletinib data to determine whether certain populations of patients may represent an opportunity for a partner committed to investing in further clinical development.\nWe are obligated to pay royalties at percentage rates ranging from mid-single digits to low-teens based on the volume of annual net sales achieved. We are required to pay up to an additional aggregate of $98.0 million in development and regulatory milestone payments if certain clinical study objectives and regulatory filings, acceptances and approvals are achieved. In addition, we are required to pay up to an aggregate of $120.0 million in sales milestone payments if certain annual sales targets are achieved.\nFinancial Operations Overview\nRevenue\nTo date, we have generated $13.6 million in license and milestone revenue related to our collaboration and license agreement with Servier. During December 2016, we recorded $0.1 million revenue related to sales of Rubraca, which we began to commercialize on December 19, 2016. For further discussion of our revenue recognition policy, see \u201cCritical Accounting Policies and Significant Judgments and Estimates\u201d below. Our ability to generate revenue and become profitable depends upon our ability to successfully commercialize products. Any inability on our part to successfully commercialize Rubraca in the United States and any foreign territories where it may be approved, or any significant delay in such approvals, could have a material adverse impact on our ability to execute upon our business strategy and, ultimately, to generate sufficient revenues from Rubraca to reach or maintain profitability or sustain our anticipated levels of operations.\nResearch and Development Expenses\nResearch and development expenses consist of costs incurred for the development of our product candidates and companion diagnostics, which include.\n\u00b7\nlicense fees and milestone payments related to the acquisition of in-licensed products, which are reported on our Consolidated Statements of Operations as acquired in-process research and development;\n\u00b7\nemployee-related expenses, including salaries, benefits, travel and share-based compensation expense;\n\u00b7\nexpenses incurred under agreements with contract research organizations (\u201cCROs\u201d) and investigative sites that conduct our clinical trials;\n\u00b7\nthe cost of acquiring, developing and manufacturing clinical trial materials;\n\u00b7\ncosts associated with non-clinical activities and regulatory operations;\n\u00b7\nmarket research, disease education and other commercial product planning activities, including the hiring of a U.S. sales and marketing and medical affairs organization in preparation for commercial launch of rucaparib; and\n\u00b7\nactivities associated with the development of companion diagnostics for our product candidates.\nResearch and development costs are expensed as incurred. License fees and milestone payments related to in-licensed products and technology are expensed if it is determined that they have no alternative future use. Costs for certain development activities, such as clinical trials and manufacturing of clinical supply, are recognized based on an evaluation of the progress to completion of specific tasks using data such as patient enrollment, clinical site activations or information provided to us by our vendors. As a result of the FDA approval of Rubraca and the discontinuation of enrollment in rociletinib, our research and development expenses will decrease for 2017 as we continue to commercialize Rubraca and commercialization related expenses are classified as selling, general and administrative expenses and not research and development costs.\n60\nTable of Contents\nThe following table identifies research and development and acquired in-process research and development costs on a program-specific basis for our products under development. Personnel-related costs, depreciation and share-based compensation are not allocated to specific programs, as they are deployed across multiple projects under development and, as such, are separately classified as personnel and other expenses in the table below.\nYear Ended December 31,\n2016\n2015\n2014\n(in thousands)\nRucaparib Expenses\nResearch and development\n$101,598\n\t\t\t\t\n$58,922\n\t\t\t\t\n$35,010\n\t\t\t\t\nAcquired in-process R&D\n1,300\n\t\t\t\t\n\u2014\n400\n\t\t\t\t\nRucaparib Total\n102,898\n\t\t\t\t\n58,922\n\t\t\t\t\n35,410\n\t\t\t\t\nLucitanib Expenses\nResearch and development (a)\n(1,337)\n\t\t\t\t\n1,923\n\t\t\t\t\n(491)\n\t\t\t\t\nAcquired in-process R&D\n\u2014\n\u2014\n3,406\n\t\t\t\t\nLucitanib Total\n(1,337)\n\t\t\t\t\n1,923\n\t\t\t\t\n2,915\n\t\t\t\t\nRociletinib Expenses\nResearch and development\n43,768\n\t\t\t\t\n122,912\n\t\t\t\t\n69,920\n\t\t\t\t\nAcquired in-process R&D\n\u2014\n12,000\n\t\t\t\t\n5,000\n\t\t\t\t\nRociletinib Total\n43,768\n\t\t\t\t\n134,912\n\t\t\t\t\n74,920\n\t\t\t\t\nPersonnel and other expenses\n107,100\n\t\t\t\t\n85,494\n\t\t\t\t\n33,266\n\t\t\t\t\nTotal\n$252,429\n\t\t\t\t\n$281,251\n\t\t\t\t\n$146,511\n\t\t\t\t\n(a)\nThis amount reflects actual costs incurred less amounts due from Servier for reimbursable development expenses pursuant to the collaboration and license agreement described in Note 11,\nLicense Agreements,\nto our audited consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nResearch and development expenses increased significantly from 2014 through 2015 due to the expansion of our clinical development activities for rociletinib and rucaparib. In addition, during 2015, we increased commercial product planning activities\nin anticipation of the potential regulatory approval and commercial launch in the U.S. of rociletinib. These activities included the hiring of our U.S. sales and marketing and medical affairs organizations. For 2016, research and development expenses decreased compared to 2015 primarily due to decreased development activities for the rociletinib program, partially offset by higher expenses related to the rucaparib program.\nSelling, General and Administrative Expenses\nSelling, general and administrative expenses consist principally of salaries and related costs for personnel in executive, finance, legal, investor relations, human resources and information technology functions. Other general and administrative expenses include facilities expenses, communication expenses, information technology costs, corporate insurance and professional fees for legal, consulting and accounting services. With the FDA approval of Rubraca on December 19, 2016, all sales and marketing expenses associated with Rubraca are included in selling, general and administrative expenses.\nEffective May 9, 2016, at Mr. Mahaffy\u2019s request, the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors approved his waiver of any annual base salary in excess of $1.00, plus the cost of the employee portion of any premiums to be paid pursuant to any health and welfare benefit plans maintained by us and any tax withholdings related to health and welfare benefits. Such waiver continued in effect until the earliest to occur of (i) the Company entering into a definitive agreement with respect to a transaction that if consummated would constitute a Change in Control (as defined in his Employment Agreement) or the public announcement of a proposal or transaction that if consummated would constitute a Change of Control, (ii) approval by the FDA to commercially distribute, sell or market rucaparib, and (iii) termination of his employment by the Company without Just Cause or by Mr. Mahaffy for Good Reason (each as defined in his Employment Agreement). On December 19, 2016, the FDA approved Rubraca resulting in the discontinuation of Mr. Mahaffy\u2019s waiver.\n61\nTable of Contents\nAcquired In-Process Research and Development Expenses\nAcquired in-process research and development expenses consist of upfront payments to acquire a new drug compound, as well as subsequent milestone payments. Acquired in-process research and development payments are immediately expensed provided that the drug has not achieved regulatory approval for marketing and, absent obtaining such approval, has no alternative future use. Once regulatory approval is received, payments to acquire rights, and the related milestone payments, are capitalized and the amortization of such assets recorded to product cost of sales.\nImpairment of Intangible Asset\nIn connection with the acquisition of EOS in November 2013, we recorded intangible assets to reflect the fair value of acquired in-process research and development (\u201cIPR&D\u201d) as of the acquisition date. The fair value was established based upon discounted cash flow models using assumptions related to the timing of development, probability of development and regulatory success, sales and commercialization factors and estimated product life. During the second quarter of 2016, we recorded a $104.5 million impairment charge due to our and our development partner\u2019s decision to discontinue the development of lucitanib for breast cancer. At December 31, 2016, the IPR&D intangible asset recorded on the Consolidated Balance Sheets was zero.\nPreviously, the Company recorded an $89.6 million impairment charge to the IPR&D intangible assets during the fourth quarter of 2015.\nChange in Fair Value of Contingent Purchase Consideration\nIn connection with the acquisition of EOS in November 2013, we also recorded a purchase consideration liability equal to the estimated fair value of future payments that are contingent upon the achievement of various regulatory and sales milestones. Subsequent to the acquisition date, we re-measure contingent consideration arrangements at fair value each reporting period and record changes in fair value to change in fair value of contingent purchase consideration and foreign currency gains (losses) for changes in the foreign currency translation rate on the Consolidated Statements of Operations. Changes in fair value are primarily attributed to new information about the likelihood of achieving such milestones and the passage of time. In the absence of new information, changes to fair value reflect only the passage of time as we progress towards the achievement of future milestones.\nDuring the second quarter of 2016, we recorded a $25.5 million reduction in the fair value of the contingent purchase consideration liability due to our and our development partner\u2019s decision to discontinue the development of lucitanib for breast cancer. At December 31, 2016, the contingent purchase consideration liability recorded on the Consolidated Balance Sheets remained at zero due to the uncertainty of achieving any of the lucitanib regulatory milestones, and therefore the remote likelihood of future milestone payout amounts to the former EOS shareholders.\nOther Income and Expense\nOther income and expense is primarily comprised of foreign currency gains and losses resulting from transactions with CROs, investigational sites and contract manufacturers where payments are made in currencies other than the U.S. dollar. In addition, a significant portion of the contingent purchase consideration liability will be settled in Euro-denominated payments if certain future milestones are achieved and is subject to fluctuations in foreign currency rates. Other expense also includes interest expense recognized related to our convertible senior notes.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Significant Judgments and Estimates\nOur discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based on our financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, expenses and revenue and related disclosures. On an ongoing basis, we evaluate our estimates and judgments, including those related to contingent purchase consideration, the allocation of purchase consideration, intangible asset impairment, clinical trial accruals and share-based compensation. We base our estimates on historical experience, known trends and events and various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions.\n62\nTable of Contents\nOur significant accounting policies are described in more detail in the notes to our consolidated financial statements appearing elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. We believe the following accounting policies to be most critical to the judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our financial statements.\nAccrued Research and Development Expenses\nAs part of the process of preparing our financial statements, we are required to estimate our accrued expenses. This process involves reviewing open contracts and purchase orders, communicating with our personnel to identify services that have been performed on our behalf and estimating the level of service performed and the associated cost incurred for the service when we have not yet been invoiced or otherwise notified of the actual cost. The majority of our service providers invoice us monthly in arrears for services performed or when contractual milestones are met. We make estimates of our accrued expenses as of each balance sheet date in our financial statements based on facts and circumstances known to us at that time. We periodically confirm the accuracy of our estimates with the service providers and make adjustments if necessary. Examples of estimated accrued research and development expenses include.\n\u00b7\nfees paid to CROs in connection with clinical studies;\n\u00b7\nfees paid to investigative sites in connection with clinical studies;\n\u00b7\nfees paid to vendors in connection with non-clinical development activities;\n\u00b7\nfees paid to vendors associated with the development of companion diagnostics; and\n\u00b7\nfees paid to vendors related to product manufacturing, development and distribution of clinical supplies.\nWe base our expenses related to clinical studies on our estimates of the services received and efforts expended pursuant to contracts with multiple CROs that conduct and manage clinical studies on our behalf. The financial terms of these agreements are subject to negotiation, vary from contract to contract and may result in uneven payment flows. There may be instances in which payments made to our vendors will exceed the level of services provided and result in a prepayment of the clinical expense. Payments under some of these contracts depend on factors such as the successful enrollment of patients and the completion of clinical trial milestones. In accruing service fees, we estimate the time period over which services will be performed, enrollment of patients, number of sites activated and the level of effort to be expended in each period. If the actual timing of the performance of services or the level of effort varies from our estimate, we adjust the accrual or prepaid accordingly. Although we do not expect our estimates to be materially different from amounts actually incurred, our understanding of the status and timing of services performed relative to the actual status and timing of services performed may vary and may result in us reporting amounts that are too high or too low in any particular period. Based on the amount of accrued research and development expenses as of December 31, 2016, if our estimates of our net accrued liabilities are too high or too low by 5%, this could increase or decrease our research and development expenses by approximately $1.8 million.\nShare-Based Compensation\nDetermining the amount of share-based compensation to be recorded requires us to develop estimates of the fair value of stock options as of their grant date. Compensation expense is recognized over the vesting period of the award. Calculating the fair value of share-based awards requires that we make highly subjective assumptions. We use the Black-Scholes option pricing model to value our stock option awards. Use of this valuation methodology requires that we make assumptions as to the expected dividend yield, price volatility of our common stock, the risk-free interest rate for a period that approximates the expected term of our stock options and the expected term of our stock options. We utilize a dividend yield of zero based on the fact that we have never paid cash dividends and have no current intention to pay cash dividends.\n63\nTable of Contents\nThe fair value of stock options for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014 was estimated at the grant date using the following weighted average assumptions for the respective periods.\nYear Ended December 31,\n2016\n2015\n2014\nDividend yield\n\u2014\n\u2014\n\u2014\nVolatility (a)\n93\n\t\t\t\t%\n72\n\t\t\t\t%\n70\n\t\t\t\t%\nRisk-free interest rate (b)\n1.77\n\t\t\t\t%\n1.77\n\t\t\t\t%\n1.92\n\t\t\t\t%\nExpected term (years) (c)\n5.8\n\t\t\t\t\n6.1\n\t\t\t\t\n6.2\n\t\t\t\t\n(a)\nVolatility\n:  The expected volatility was estimated using our historical data.\n(b)\nRisk-free interest rate\n:  The rate is based on the yield on the grant date of a zero-coupon U.S. Treasury bond whose maturity period approximates the option\u2019s expected term.\n(c)\nExpected term\n:  The expected term of the award was estimated using our historical data.\nWe recognized share-based compensation expense of approximately $39.8 million, $40.4 million and $21.5 million for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively. As of December 31, 2016, we had $86.8 million in total unrecognized share-based compensation expense, net of related forfeiture estimates, which is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average remaining vesting period of 3.1 years. We expect our share-based compensation to continue to grow in future periods due to the potential increases in the value of our common stock and headcount.\nWe are required to estimate the level of forfeitures expected to occur and record compensation expense only for those awards that we ultimately expect will vest.\nValuation of Contingent Consideration Resulting from a Business Combination\nContingent consideration resulting from a business combination is reported at its fair value on the acquisition date. Each subsequent reporting period, the contingent consideration obligations are revalued and changes in fair value are recorded to change in fair value of contingent purchase consideration and foreign currency gains (losses) for changes in the foreign currency translation rate on the Consolidated Statements of Operations.\nChanges to contingent consideration obligations can result from adjustments to discount rates and time periods, updates in the assumed achievement or timing of any development milestone or changes in the probability of certain clinical events and regulatory approvals. The assumptions related to determining the value of contingent consideration require significant judgment and changes to the assumptions may have a material impact on the amount of expense recorded in any given period. The acquisition of EOS resulted in the recognition of a contingent consideration liability, based on assumptions related to potential future payout amounts, estimated discount rate, probability of success for each milestone achievement and the estimated timing of the milestone payments to the former EOS shareholders.\nDuring the second quarter 2016, we recorded $25.5 million reduction in fair value of the contingent purchase consideration due to our and our development partner\u2019s decision to discontinue the development of lucitanib for breast cancer. At December 31, 2016, the contingent purchase consideration liability recorded on the Consolidated Balance Sheets remained at zero due to the uncertainty of achieving any of the lucitanib regulatory milestones, and therefore the remote likelihood of future milestone payout amounts to the former EOS shareholders.\nIntangible Assets\nDefinite-lived intangible assets related to capitalized milestones under license agreements are amortized on a straight-line basis over their remaining useful lives, which are estimated to be the remaining patent life.  If our estimate of the product\u2019s useful life is shorter than the remaining patent life, then a shorter period is used. Amortization expense is recorded as a component of cost of sales in the Consolidated Statements of Operations.\nIPR&D assets were established as part of the acquisition of EOS in November 2013 and have not been amortized, but have been assessed for impairment.\nIntangible assets are evaluated for impairment at least annually in the fourth quarter or more frequently if impairment indicators exist.\nEvents that could result in an impairment, or trigger an interim impairment assessment, include the decision to\n64\nTable of Contents\ndiscontinue the development of a drug, the receipt of additional clinical or nonclinical data regarding our drug candidate or a potentially competitive drug candidate, changes in the clinical development program for a drug candidate, or new information regarding potential sales for the drug.\nIn connection with any impairment assessment, the fair value of the intangible assets as of the date of assessment is compared to the carrying value of the intangible asset. Impairment losses are recognized if the carrying value of an intangible asset is both not recoverable and exceeds its fair value. During the second quarter of 2016, we recorded a $104.5 million impairment charge to the IPR&D intangible assets due to our and our development partner\u2019s decision to discontinue the development of lucitanib for breast cancer, thereby reducing the remaining carrying value to zero.\nRevenue Recognition\nWe are currently approved to sell Rubraca in the United States markets.  We distribute our product principally through a limited number of specialty distributor and specialty pharmacy providers, collectively, our customers.  Our customers subsequently resell our products to patients and health care providers.  Separately, we have arrangements with certain payors and other third parties that provide for government-mandated and privately-negotiated rebates, chargebacks and discounts.\nRevenues from product sales are recognized when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, delivery has occurred and title of the product and associated risk of loss has passed to the customer, the price is fixed or determinable, collection from the customer has been reasonably assured and all performance obligations have been met and returns and allowances can be reasonably estimated. Product sales are recorded net of estimated rebates, chargebacks, discounts and other deductions as well as estimated product returns. Estimating rebates, chargebacks, discounts, product returns and other deductions requires significant judgments about future events and uncertainties, and requires us to rely heavily on assumptions, as well as historical experience. We only recognize revenue on product sales once the product is resold to the patient or healthcare provider by the specialty distributor or specialty pharmacy provider, therefore reducing the significance of estimates made for product returns.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2016, we recognized $0.1 million of product revenue. Based on our policy to expense costs associated with the manufacture of our products prior to regulatory approval, certain of the costs of Rubraca units recognized as revenue during the year ended December 31, 2016 were expensed prior to the December 19, 2016 FDA approval, and therefore are not included in cost of sales during the current period. We expect cost of sales to increase in relation to product revenues as we deplete these inventories. We expect to use the remaining pre-commercialization inventory for product sales through the third quarter of 2017.\nRevenue is recognized from milestone payments when the following criteria have been met: (1) persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists; (2) delivery has occurred or services have been rendered; (3) the price is fixed or determinable; and (4) collectability is reasonably assured. We exercise judgment in determining that collectability is reasonably assured or that services have been delivered in accordance with the arrangement. We assess whether the fee is fixed or determinable based on the payment terms associated with the transaction and whether the sales price is subject to refund or adjustment. We assess collectability based primarily on the customer\u2019s payment history and creditworthiness of the customer. Payments that are contingent upon the achievement of a milestone will be recognized in the period in which the milestone is achieved.\nResults of Operations\nComparison of Years Ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014.\nLicense and Milestone Revenue.\nLicense and milestone revenue for the year ended December 31, 2014 was due to the recognition of $13.6 million of milestone revenue from Servier upon the end of opposition and appeal of the lucitanib patent by the European Patent Office in the first quarter of 2014. We did not recognize any license and milestone revenue in 2016 and 2015.\nProduct Revenue, Net.\nProduct revenue for the year ended December 31, 2016 was due to the recognition of $0.1 million of product revenue from the sale of Rubraca, which was approved for sale in the United States markets on December 19, 2016.\nCost of Sales - Product.\nCost of sales for the year ended December 31, 2016 consists of costs associated with the sale of Rubraca, mainly freight, royalties and amortization of capitalized acquired intangible license right and milestone\n65\nTable of Contents\npayments related to Rubraca. Based on our policy to expense costs associated with the manufacture of our products prior to regulatory approval, certain of the costs of Rubraca units recognized as revenue during the year ended December 31, 2016 were expensed prior to the December 19, 2016 FDA approval, and therefore are not included in costs of sales during the current period. We expect cost of sales to increase in relation to product revenues as we deplete these inventories and amortize the capitalized acquired intangible license rights and milestone payments related to Rubraca. We expect to use the remaining pre-commercialization inventory for product sales through the third quarter of 2017.\nResearch and Development Expenses.\nResearch and development expenses for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014 were as follows.\nYear Ended December 31,\n2016\n2015\n2014\n(in thousands)\nResearch and development expenses\n$251,129\n\t\t\t\t\n$269,251\n\t\t\t\t\n$137,705\n\t\t\t\t\nIncrease (decrease) from prior year\n$(18,122)\n\t\t\t\t\n$131,546\n\t\t\t\t\nn\/a% Change from prior year\n(6.7)\n\t\t\t\t%\n95.5\n\t\t\t\t%\nn\/a\nThe decrease in research and development expenses for the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to 2015 was primarily due to decreased development activities for the rociletinib program partially offset by higher expenses related to the rucaparib program.\nClinical trial costs for rucaparib were $14.0 million higher in 2016 than the prior year primarily due to higher enrollment in the ARIEL2 and ARIEL3 studies in ovarian cancer. Market research, disease education and other commercial product planning activities were $16.6 million higher than the prior year due to the preparation for the potential regulatory approval and commercial launch of rucaparib. Clinical supply and related manufacturing development costs were $9.2 million higher than the prior year, as we increased production to support the expanded clinical studies. In addition, diagnostic development costs for rucaparib were $0.9 million higher than the prior year due to the advancement of our collaboration with Foundation Medicine, Inc. to develop a novel companion diagnostic test to identify patients most likely to respond to rucaparib.\nSalaries, share-based compensation expense and other personnel-related costs were $24.0 million higher in 2016 driven by increased headcount to support our expanded development and commercial planning activities. During the third quarter of 2015, we completed the hiring of our U.S. sales and marketing and medical affairs organization in preparation for the potential regulatory approval and commercial launch of rociletinib.\nClinical trial costs for rociletinib were $41.0 million lower in 2016 than the prior year primarily due to the completion of patient enrollment in the TIGER-1, TIGER-2 and TIGER-X studies in non-small cell lung cancer. This decrease was partially offset by higher clinical trial costs for the TIGER-3 study, which began enrolling patients during the second quarter of 2015. Market research, disease education and other commercial planning activities were $19.7 million lower than the prior year. We incurred higher costs during 2015 due to the preparation for the potential regulatory approval and commercial launch of rociletinib. In addition, clinical supply and related manufacturing development costs were $17.2 million lower than the prior year driven by timing of production to support our clinical studies.\nThe increase in research and development expenses for the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to 2014 was primarily due to increased development activities for the rociletinib and rucaparib programs.\nClinical trial costs for rucaparib were $10.3 million higher in 2015 than the prior year primarily due to higher enrollment in the ARIEL2 and ARIEL3 studies in ovarian cancer, as well as the expansion of Study 010 in 2015. Development costs for rucaparib were $5.9 million higher than 2014 due to the advancement of our collaboration with Foundation Medicine, Inc. to develop a novel companion diagnostic test to identify patients most likely to respond to rucaparib.\nSalaries, share-based compensation expense and other personnel-related costs were $49.4 million higher in 2015, including a $15.8 million increase in share-based compensation expense, driven by increased headcount to support our expanded development and commercial planning activities. During 2015, we completed the hiring of our U.S. sales and marketing and medical affairs organizations in preparation for the potential commercial launch of rociletinib.\n66\nTable of Contents\nCosts associated with non-clinical and clinical development activities for rociletinib were $35.6 million higher in 2015 than 2014 driven by increased patient enrollment in the TIGER program of studies in NSCLC. In addition, market research, disease education and other commercial product planning activities for rociletinib were $18.2 million higher in 2015 due to the preparation for the potential commercial launch of rociletinib.\nClinical supply and related manufacturing development costs for both programs were $3.2 million higher than 2014, as we increased production to support the expanded clinical studies.\nSelling, General and Administrative Expenses.\nGeneral and administrative expenses for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014 were as follows.\nYear Ended December 31,\n2016\n2015\n2014\n(in thousands)\nSelling, general and administrative expenses\n$40,731\n\t\t\t\t\n$30,524\n\t\t\t\t\n$21,457\n\t\t\t\t\nIncrease from prior year\n$10,207\n\t\t\t\t\n$9,067\n\t\t\t\t\nn\/a% Change from prior year\n33.4\n\t\t\t\t%\n42.3\n\t\t\t\t%\nn\/a\nThe increase in selling, general and administrative expenses for the year ended December 31, 2016 over 2015 was primarily due to $3.1 million of selling expenses related to the commercialization of Rubraca, $5.3 million higher legal expense and, to a lesser extent, higher personnel costs. Pre-commercialization activities for Rubraca were included in research and development expenses.\nThe increase in selling, general and administrative expenses for the year ended December 31, 2015 over 2014 was primarily due to $3.0 million higher share-based compensation expense, $1.4 million higher facilities expense, $1.2 million higher personnel costs, $1.1 million higher legal expense and $1.0 million higher consulting fees.\nAcquired In-Process Research and Development Expenses.\nAcquired in-process research and development expenses for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014 were as follows.\nYear Ended December 31,\n2016\n2015\n2014\n(in thousands)\nAcquired in-process research and development\n$1,300\n\t\t\t\t\n$12,000\n\t\t\t\t\n$8,806\n\t\t\t\t\nIncrease (decrease) from prior year\n$(10,700)\n\t\t\t\t\n$3,194\n\t\t\t\t\nn\/a% Change from prior year\n(89.2)\n\t\t\t\t%\n36.3\n\t\t\t\t%\nn\/a\nAcquired in-process research and development expenses decreased for the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to 2015. During the third quarter of 2015, we made milestone payments totaling $12.0 million to Celgene upon acceptance of the NDA and MAA for rociletinib by the FDA and EMA, respectively. During the second quarter of 2016, we made a milestone payment of $0.3 million to AstraZeneca upon the NDA submission for rucaparib. During 2016, we made milestone payments totaling $1.0 million to Pfizer upon acceptance of the NDA and MAA for rucaparib by the FDA and EMA, respectively.\nThe increase in acquired in-process research and development expenses for the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to 2014 was due to higher payments made to partners related to in-licensing agreements. During the third quarter of 2015, we made milestone payments totaling $12.0 million to Celgene upon acceptance of the NDA and MAA for rociletinib by the FDA and EMA, respectively. During the first quarter of 2014, we made a $5.0 million milestone payment to Celgene upon initiation of the Phase II study for rociletinib, and we recorded a $3.4 million charge for a milestone payment to Advenchen, representing 25% of the sublicense agreement consideration of $13.6 million received from Servier upon the end of opposition and appeal of the lucitanib patent by the European Patent Office. During the second quarter of 2014, we also made a $0.4 million milestone payment to Pfizer upon initiation of a pivotal registration study for rucaparib.\nImpairment of Intangible Asset.\nDuring the second quarter of 2016, we recorded a $104.5 million impairment charge to the IPR&D intangible asset relating to our lucitanib product candidate which reduced the carrying value of the intangible assets related to the product to zero. This reduction in the estimated fair value of lucitanib was the result of our and our development partner\u2019s decision to discontinue the development of lucitanib for breast cancer. During the\n67\nTable of Contents\nfourth quarter of 2015, we recorded an $89.6 million impairment charge to the IPR&D intangible asset relating to our lucitanib product candidate. This reduction in the estimated fair value of lucitanib was the result of our and our development partner\u2019s decision to terminate the development of lucitanib for lung cancer, as well as updates to the probability-weighted discounted cash flow assumptions for the breast cancer indication. During the first quarter of 2014, we recorded a $3.4 million reduction to the intangible asset\u2019s expected future cash flows resulting from the receipt of a lucitanib milestone payment from Servier.\nChange in Fair Value of Contingent Purchase Consideration.\nChange in fair value of contingent purchase consideration was a decrease of $24.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to a decrease of $24.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 and an increase of $0.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2014. During the second quarter of 2016, we recorded a $25.5 million reduction in the fair value of the contingent purchase consideration liability due to our and our development partner\u2019s decision to discontinue the development of lucitanib for breast cancer. During the fourth quarter of 2015, we recorded a $26.9 million reduction in the fair value of the contingent purchase consideration liability due to a change in the estimated probability-weighted future milestone payments, as well as the timing of such payments, for the lucitanib program.\nOther Income (Expense), Net.\nOther income (expense), net for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014 was as follows.\nYear Ended December 31,\n2016\n2015\n2014\n(in thousands)\nOther income (expense), net\n$(8,438)\n\t\t\t\t\n$(5,216)\n\t\t\t\t\n$736\n\t\t\t\t\nFavorable (unfavorable) change from prior year\n$(3,222)\n\t\t\t\t\n$(5,952)\n\t\t\t\t\nn\/a\nFavorable (unfavorable) % Change from prior year\n(61.8)\n\t\t\t\t%\n(808.7)\n\t\t\t\t%\nn\/a\nOther expense increased for the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to 2015. During 2016, we recognized $0.6 million of foreign currency losses compared with $2.7 million of gains in 2015. The change in the foreign currency gains and losses was driven by fluctuations in the foreign currency rate utilized to translate our Euro-denominated contingent purchase consideration liability into U.S. dollars.\nOther expense increased for the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to 2014 primarily due to higher interest expense related to our convertible senior notes issued in September 2014.\nIncome Tax Benefit (Expense).\nFor the year ended December 31, 2016, we recognized a $28.4 million deferred tax benefit associated with the impairment of the IPR&D intangible assets recorded in the second quarter of 2016. In addition, during the first quarter 2016, we recognized a $3.6 million deferred tax benefit due to a reduction in the enacted corporate tax rate of a foreign jurisdiction in which we operate.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2015, we recognized a $29.1 million deferred tax benefit primarily associated with the impairment of the IPR&D intangible assets recorded in the fourth quarter of 2015.\nFor the year ended 2014, we recognized income tax expense primarily due to recording foreign tax provisions during the first quarter of 2014 related to milestone revenue recognized under the Servier license agreement, partially offset by a deferred tax benefit recognized upon the reduction of the carrying value of the IPR&D intangible assets in the first quarter of 2014.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nTo date, we have funded our operations through the public offering of our common stock and the private placement of convertible debt securities and preferred stock. In January 2017, we sold 5,750,000 shares of our common stock in a public offering at $41.00 per share. The net proceeds from the offering were $221.2 million, after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and offering expenses. As of December 31, 2016, we had cash, cash equivalents and available-for-sale securities totaling $266.2 million.\n68\nTable of Contents\nThe following table sets forth the primary sources and uses of cash for each of the periods set forth below.\nYear Ended December 31,\n2016\n2015\n2014\n(in thousands)\nNet cash used in operating activities\n$(266,680)\n\t\t\t\t\n$(253,066)\n\t\t\t\t\n$(117,051)\n\t\t\t\t\nNet cash provided by (used in) investing activities\n199,299\n\t\t\t\t\n(254,578)\n\t\t\t\t\n(2,286)\n\t\t\t\t\nNet cash provided by financing activities\n5,176\n\t\t\t\t\n304,480\n\t\t\t\t\n279,476\n\t\t\t\t\nEffect of exchange rate changes on cash and cash equivalents\n(365)\n\t\t\t\t\n(757)\n\t\t\t\t\n(690)\n\t\t\t\t\nNet (decrease) increase in cash and cash equivalents\n$(62,570)\n\t\t\t\t\n$(203,921)\n\t\t\t\t\n$159,449\n\t\t\t\t\nOperating Activities\nNet cash used in operating activities for all periods resulted primarily from our net losses adjusted for non-cash charges and changes in components of working capital. Net cash used in operating activities increased $13.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to 2015 driven by an increase in payments for other accrued expenses related to the rociletinib program of non-clinical and clinical development studies, for which enrollment was completed  in 2016.\nNet cash used in operating activities increased $136.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to 2014 driven by higher rociletinib and rucaparib research and development costs associated with the expansion of the clinical trials, as well as the preparation for the potential commercial launch of rociletinib, and higher salaries, benefits and personnel-related costs resulting from increased headcount to support the expanded development activities and commercial planning for our product candidates. During the third quarter of 2015, we made milestone payments totaling $12.0 million to Celgene upon acceptance of the NDA and MAA for rociletinib by the FDA and EMA, respectively. During the year ended December 31, 2015, we also paid $7.3 million in interest related to the convertible senior notes. The net loss for the year ended December 31, 2014 was partially offset by a $13.6 million milestone revenue payment received from Servier.\nInvesting Activities\nNet cash provided by investing activities for the year ended December 31, 2016 includes $200.0 million in sales of available-for-sale securities compared to net purchases of $251.5 million in 2015.\nNet cash used in investing activities increased $252.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to 2014 primarily due to net purchases of available-for-sale securities.\nFinancing Activities\nNet cash provided by financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2016 is due to $5.2 million received from employee stock option exercises and stock purchases under the employee stock purchase plan.\nNet cash provided by financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2015 includes $298.5 million in net proceeds received from our common stock offering in July 2015 and $6.0 million received from employee stock option exercises and stock purchases under the employee stock purchase plan.\nNet cash provided by financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2014 includes $278.3 million in net proceeds received from our convertible senior notes offering in September 2014 and $1.2 million received from employee stock option exercises and stock purchases under the employee stock purchase plan.\nOperating Capital Requirements\nOn December 19, 2016, the FDA approved Rubraca tablets as monotherapy for the treatment of patients with deleterious BRCA mutation (germline and\/or somatic) associated with advanced ovarian cancer, who have been treated with two or more chemotherapies, and selected for therapy based on FDA-approved companion diagnostic for Rubraca. We expect to incur significant losses for the foreseeable future, as we commercialize Rubraca and expand our selling, general and administrative functions to support the growth in our commercial organization. Additionally, our operating\n69\nTable of Contents\nplan for the next 12 months includes a significant investment in inventory to meet the projected commercial requirements for Rubraca. We receive the active pharmaceutical ingredient in Rubraca from one supplier and we experience long lead times associated with its production. Accordingly, we expect to experience a decrease in our liquidity at the beginning of a production cycle and an increase as the inventory produced is sold through.\nAs of December 31, 2016, we had cash, cash equivalents and available-for-sale securities totaling $266.2 million and total current liabilities of $65.6 million. In January 2017, we sold 5,750,000 shares of our common stock in a public offering at $41.00 per share. The net proceeds from the offering were $221.2 million, after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and offering expenses. We intend to use the net proceeds of the offering for general corporate purposes, including commercial planning and sales and marketing expenses associated with the launch of Rubraca in the United States and, if approved by the EMA in Europe, funding of its development programs, selling, general and administrative expenses, acquisition or licensing of additional product candidates or businesses and working capital. Based on current estimates, we believe that our existing cash, cash equivalents and available-for-sale securities will allow us to fund our operating plan through at least the next 12 months.\nBecause of the numerous risks and uncertainties associated with research, development and commercialization of pharmaceutical products, we are unable to estimate the exact amounts of our working capital requirements. Our future funding requirements will depend on many factors, including but not limited to.\n\u00b7\nthe number and characteristics of the product candidates, companion diagnostics and indications we pursue;\n\u00b7\nthe achievement of various development, regulatory and commercial milestones resulting in required payments to partners pursuant to the terms of our license agreements;\n\u00b7\nthe scope, progress, results and costs of researching and developing our product candidates and related companion diagnostics and conducting clinical and non-clinical trials;\n\u00b7\nthe timing of, and the costs involved in, obtaining regulatory approvals for our product candidates and companion diagnostics;\n\u00b7\nthe cost of commercialization activities, including marketing and distribution costs;\n\u00b7\nthe cost of manufacturing any of our product candidates we successfully commercialize;\n\u00b7\nthe costs involved in preparing, filing, prosecuting, maintaining, defending and enforcing patent claims, including litigation costs and outcome of such litigation; and\n\u00b7\nthe timing, receipt and amount of sales, if any, of our product candidates.\nContractual Obligations and Commitments\nThe following table summarizes our contractual obligations at December 31, 2016 (in thousands).\nLess\nthan\n1\nMore\nThan\n5\nYear\n1\nto\n3\nYears\n3\nto\n5\nYears\nYears\nTotal\nConvertible senior notes\n$\u2014\n$\u2014\n$287,500\n\t\t\t\t\n$\u2014\n$287,500\n\t\t\t\t\nInterest on convertible senior notes\n7,187\n\t\t\t\t\n14,375\n\t\t\t\t\n12,279\n\t\t\t\t\n\u2014\n33,841\n\t\t\t\t\nOperating lease commitments\n1,822\n\t\t\t\t\n3,620\n\t\t\t\t\n3,838\n\t\t\t\t\n600\n\t\t\t\t\n9,880\n\t\t\t\t\nMilestone payments (a)\n\u2014\n23,000\n\t\t\t\t\n\u2014\n\u2014\n23,000\n\t\t\t\t\nPurchase and other commitments (b)\n49,177\n\t\t\t\t\n51,544\n\t\t\t\t\n23,543\n\t\t\t\t\n47,086\n\t\t\t\t\n171,350\n\t\t\t\t\nTotal\n$58,186\n\t\t\t\t\n$92,539\n\t\t\t\t\n$327,160\n\t\t\t\t\n$47,686\n\t\t\t\t\n$525,571\n\t\t\t\t\n(a)\nAmount relates to a $20 million milestone payment, which we have exercised the option to defer payment by agreeing to pay $23 million within 18 months after the date of the FDA approval of Rubraca on December 19, 2016.\n(b)\nOn October 3, 2016, we entered into a Manufacturing and Services Agreement (the \u201cAgreement\u201d) with a non-exclusive third-party supplier for the production of the active ingredient for rucaparib. Under the terms of the Agreement, we will provide the third-party supplier a rolling forecast for the supply of the active ingredient in rucaparib that will be updated by us on a quarterly basis. We are obligated to order material sufficient to satisfy an initial quantity specified in any forecast. In addition, the third-party supplier will construct, in its existing facility, a production train that will be exclusively dedicated to the manufacture of the rucaparib active ingredient.  We are obligated to make scheduled capital program fee payments toward capital equipment and other costs associated with the construction of the dedicated production train. Further, once the facility is operational, we are obligated to pay a\n70\nTable of Contents\nfixed facility fee each quarter for the duration of the Agreement, which expires on December 31, 2025, unless extended by mutual consent of the parties.\nRoyalty and License Fee Commitments\nWe have certain obligations under licensing agreements with third parties contingent upon achieving various development, regulatory and commercial milestones. On August 30, 2016, we entered into a first amendment to the worldwide license agreement with Pfizer, which amends the June 2011 existing worldwide license agreement to permit us to defer payment of the milestone payments payable upon (i) FDA approval of an NDA for 1\nst\nIndication in US and (ii) EMA approval of an MAA for 1\nst\nIndication in EU, to a date that is 18 months after the date of achievement of such milestones. In the event that we defer such milestone payments, we have agreed to certain higher payments related to the achievement of such milestones.\nOn December 19, 2016, the FDA approved Rubraca tablets as monotherapy for the treatment of patients with deleterious BRCA mutation (germline and\/or somatic) associated with advanced ovarian cancer, who have been treated with two or more chemotherapies, and selected for therapy based on FDA-approved companion diagnostic for Rubraca. The FDA approval resulted in a $0.75 million milestone payment to Pfizer as required by the license agreement. The FDA approval also resulted in the obligation to pay a $20.0 million milestone payment, in which we have exercised the option to defer payment by agreeing to pay $23.0 million within 18 months after the date of the FDA approval. These payments were recognized as intangible assets and will be amortized over the estimated remaining useful life of rucaparib.\nPursuant to our license agreements for the development of rucaparib, we are required to make regulatory milestone payments up to an additional $69.75 million in aggregate if specified clinical study objectives and regulatory filings, acceptances and approvals are achieved. In addition, we are obligated to make sales milestone payments if specified annual sales targets for rucaparib are met, the majority of which relate to annual sales targets of $500.0 million and above, which, in aggregate, could amount to total milestone payments of $170.0 million,\nand tiered royalty payments at a mid-teen percentage rate on our net sales, with standard provisions for royalty offsets to the extent we need to obtain any rights from third parties to commercialize rucaparib.\nWe are obligated to pay additional consideration to the former EOS shareholders if certain future regulatory and lucitanib-related sales milestones are achieved. The estimated fair value of these payments was recorded as contingent purchase consideration on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. The potential contingent milestone payments range from a zero payment, which assumes lucitanib fails to achieve any of the regulatory milestones, to $186.0 million ($65.0 million and \u20ac115.0 million) if all regulatory and sales milestones are met, utilizing the translation rate at December 31, 2016. The estimated fair value of the liability was zero at December 31, 2016\ndue to the uncertainty of achieving any of the lucitanib regulatory milestones, and therefore the remote likelihood of future milestone payout amounts to the former EOS shareholders.\nWe are also obligated to pay to Advenchen 25% of any consideration, excluding royalties, received pursuant to any sublicense agreements for lucitanib, including the agreement with Servier.\nPursuant to our license agreement for the development and commercialization of rociletinib, we may be required to pay up to an additional aggregate of $98.0 million in regulatory milestone payments if certain clinical study objectives and regulatory filings, acceptance and approvals are achieved. Further, we may be required to pay up to an aggregate of $120.0 million in sales milestone payments if certain annual sales targets are met for rociletinib.\nFinally, pursuant to terms of each of our product license agreements, we will pay royalties to our licensors on sales, if any, of the respective products.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nWe did not have during the periods presented, and we do not currently have, any off-balance sheet arrangements, as defined under the rules promulgated by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.\nTax Loss Carryforwards\nAs of December 31, 2016, we have net operating loss (\u201cNOL\u201d) carryforwards of approximately $711.8 million to offset future federal income taxes. We also have research and development and orphan drug tax credit carryforwards of\n71\nTable of Contents\n$240.7 million to offset future federal income taxes. The federal net operating loss carryforwards and research and development and orphan drug tax credit carryforwards expire at various times through 2036.\nWe believe that a change in ownership as defined under Section 382 of the U.S. Internal Revenue Code occurred as a result of our public offering of common stock completed in April 2012. Future utilization of the federal net operating losses and tax credit carryforwards accumulated from inception to the change in ownership date will be subject to annual limitations to offset future taxable income. At this time, we do not believe this limitation will prevent the utilization of the federal NOL or credit carryforward prior to expiration. It is possible that a change in ownership will occur in the future, which will limit the NOL amounts generated since the last estimated change in ownership. At December 31, 2016, we recorded a 100% valuation allowance against our net deferred tax assets in the U.S. of approximately $588.8 million and a $3.6 million valuation allowance against tax assets in foreign jurisdictions, as we believe it is more likely than not that the tax benefits will not be fully realized. In the future, if we determine that a portion or all of the tax benefits associated with our tax carryforwards will be realized, net income would increase in the period of determination.\nRecently Adopted Accounting Standards\nIn August 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (\u201cFASB\u201d) issued ASU No. 2014-15, \u201cDisclosure of Uncertainties About an Entity\u2019s Ability to Continue as a Going Concern,\u201d which requires management to evaluate whether there are conditions or events that raise substantial doubt about an entity\u2019s ability to continue as a going concern and to provide disclosures when certain criteria are met. The guidance is effective for annual periods beginning in 2016 and interim reporting periods starting in the first quarter of 2017. Early application is permitted. We adopted this standard effective December 31, 2016. Adoption of the standard resulted in no change to our disclosures.\nRecently Issued Accounting Standards\nIn May 2014, the FASB issued ASU No. 2014-09, \u201cRevenue from Contracts with Customers\u201d and has subsequently issued several supplemental and\/or clarifying ASUs (collectively, \u201cASC 606\u201d). ASC 606 prescribes a single common revenue standard that replaces most existing U.S. GAAP revenue recognition guidance. ASC 606 is intended to provide a more consistent interpretation and application of the principles outlined in the standard across filers in multiple industries and within the same industries compared to current practices, which should improve comparability.  Adoption of ASC 606 is required for annual and interim periods beginning after December 15, 2017. Upon adoption, we must elect to adopt either retrospectively to each prior reporting period presented or use the cumulative effect transition method with the cumulative effect of initial adoption recognized at the date of initial application. We began recognizing revenue from product sales for the first time after the FDA approval of Rubraca on December 19, 2016 and have adopted a revenue recognition policy accordingly. We have not determined what adoption transition method we will use.  We are currently assessing the impact that the future adoption of ASC 606 may have on our consolidated financial statements and related disclosures by analyzing our current accounting policies and practices to identify potential differences in applying the guidance of ASC 606.\nIn July 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-11, which amends existing guidance for measurement of inventory.  Current inventory guidance requires an entity to measure inventory at the lower of cost or market.  Market could be replacement cost, net realizable value, or net realizable value less an approximately normal profit margin. An entity should measure all inventory to which the amendments apply at the lower of cost and net realizable value.  Net realizable value is the estimated selling prices in the ordinary course of business, less reasonably predictable costs of completion, disposal, and transportation. The amendments are effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2016, and interim periods within fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017.  The amendments should be applied prospectively with earlier application permitted as of the beginning of an interim or annual reporting period.  We do not expect the adoption of this guidance to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.\nIn February 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-02, \u201cLeases (Topic 842),\u201d which requires lessees to recognize assets and liabilities for the rights and obligations created by most leases on their balance sheet. The guidance is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018, including interim periods within those fiscal years. Early application is permitted. ASU 2016-02 requires modified retrospective adoption for all leases existing at, or entered into after, the date of initial application, with an option to use certain transition relief. We are currently evaluating the impact the standard may have on our consolidated financial statements and related disclosures.\n72\nTable of Contents\nIn March 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-09, \u201cCompensation \u2013 Stock Compensation (Topic 718): Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting\u201d, to simplify financial reporting of the income tax impacts of share-based compensation arrangements.  ASU No. 2016-09 is effective for us for annual and interim periods beginning after January 1, 2017. The classification guidance under ASU No. 2016-09 requires the recognition of excess tax benefits from share-based compensation arrangements as a discrete item within income tax benefit rather than additional paid-in capital and the classification guidance requiring presentation of excess tax benefits from share-based compensation arrangements as an operating activity on the statement of cash flows, rather than as an operating activity.\nThe adoption of ASU No 2016-09 is expected to have no immediate impact on our financial statements and related disclosures because we do not currently recognize a tax benefit related to share-based compensation expense as we maintain net operating loss carryforwards and have established a valuation allowance against the entire net deferred tax asset as of December 31, 2016.  Further, we have elected to continue to estimate the number of stock-based awards expected to vest, as permitted by ASU 2016-09, rather than electing to account for forfeitures as the occur.","56":"","57":"","58":"","59":"ITEM 7.\nMANAGEMENT\u0092S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nOverview\nVolition is a multi-national life sciences company developing simple, easy to use, blood-based cancer tests to accurately diagnose a range of cancers. The tests are based on the science of Nucleosomics\n\u00ae\n, which is the practice of identifying and measuring nucleosomes in the bloodstream or other bodily fluid - an indication that disease is present.\nAs cancer screening programs become more widespread, our products aim to help in diagnosing a range of cancers quickly, simply, accurately and cost effectively. Early diagnosis has the potential to not only prolong the life of patients, but also to improve their quality of life.\nWe are developing blood-based diagnostics for the most prevalent cancers, beginning with CRC. Following CRC, we anticipate focusing on lung cancer, prostate and pancreatic cancer, using our Nucleosomics\n\u00ae\nbiomarker discovery platform. Our development pipeline includes assays to be used for symptomatic patients or asymptomatic (screening) population.  The platform employs a range of simple Nu.Q\nTM\nimmunoassays on an industry standard ELISA format, which allows rapid quantification of epigenetic changes in biofluids (whole blood, plasma, serum, sputum, urine etc.) compared to other approaches such as bisulfite conversion and polymerase chain reaction, or PCR. Nu.Q\nTM\nbiomarkers can be used alone, or in combination to generate profiles related to specific conditions.\nWe have developed thirty-nine blood-based assays to date to detect specific biomarkers that can be used individually or in combination to generate a profile which forms the basis of a product for a particular cancer or disease.\nWe anticipate that because of their ease of use and cost efficiency, our tests have the potential to become the first method of choice for cancer diagnostics, allowing detection of a range of cancers at an earlier stage than typically occurs currently, and testing of individuals who, for reasons such as time, cost or aversion to current methods, are not currently tested.\nWe intend to commercialize our products in the future through various channels within the European Union, the United States and throughout the rest of the world, most likely beginning with Asia.\nManagement has identified the specific processes and resources required to achieve the near and medium term objectives of our business plan, including personnel, facilities, equipment, research and testing materials including antibodies and clinical samples, and the protection of intellectual property. To date, operations have proceeded satisfactorily in relation to the business plan. However it is possible that some resources will not readily become available in a suitable form or on a timely basis or at an acceptable cost. It is also possible that the results of some processes may not be as expected and that modifications of procedures and materials may be required. Such events could result in delays to the achievement of the near and medium term objectives of the business plan, in particular the progression of clinical validation studies and regulatory approval processes for the purpose of bringing products to the IVD market.\nWe do not anticipate earning significant revenues until such time as we are able to fully market our intended products on the IVD market. For this reason, our auditors stated in their report on our most recent audited financial statements that our losses and negative cash flow from operations raise substantial doubt that we will be able to continue as a going concern without further financing. Our ability to continue as a going concern is dependent upon our ability to successfully accomplish our plan of operations described herein, obtain financing and eventually attain profitable operations.\nOur first product \u0096 the Nu.Q\nTM\nColorectal Cancer Screening Triage Test achieved the CE Mark in December 2016. We now plan to conduct pathway design studies (where appropriate) as we roll out to EU and other markets. We do not anticipate significant revenues in 2017.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nAs of December 31, 2016, we had cash and cash equivalents of $21,678,734 and prepayments and other current assets of $332,814. As of December 31, 2016, we had current liabilities of $2,033,496. This represents a working capital surplus of $19,978,052.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2016, we used $9,055,693 in net cash from operating activities, compared to $8,546,274 for the year ended December 31, 2015. The increase in cash used year over year was primarily due to an increase in research and development expenditure and legal costs associated with multiple public offerings and other corporate matters. Please see\n\u0093Results of Operations,\u0094\nbelow for more detail.\n32\nNet cash used in investing activities increased year over year by $282,896 to $415,091 for the year ended December 31, 2016, mainly as a result of the purchase of a new building and land in Belgium. For further details, see Note 11(c) of the Consolidated Financial Statements.\nNet cash provided by financing activities amounted to $25,379,356 for the year ended December 31, 2016, compared to $12,442,505 for the year ended December 31, 2015. In March 2016 we raised approximately $13.1 million in net cash proceeds when approximately 4.3 million shares of common stock were issued in a public offering. In October 2016 we raised approximately $11.8 million in net cash proceeds when approximately 2.5 million shares of common stock were issued in a public offering.  We also raised approximately $0.4 million from exercises of warrants and stock options for the year ended December 31, 2016. Repayments on a capital lease for a new building in Belgium resulted in approximately $0.6 million of cash outflow over this period. This was offset by cash proceeds of $0.5 million from debt financing on the aforementioned building in Belgium. This resulted in an increase of cash and cash equivalents of $15,762,728 for the year ended December 31, 2016, compared to an increase of $3,777,042 for the year ended December 31, 2015.\nWe currently lease three Tecan machines (automated liquid handling robots) under a lease classified as a capital lease. The total cost of this leased laboratory equipment is $578,830 (\n\u20ac\n550,454). The capital lease is repayable over a five year period, ending in 2020.\nOn October 4, 2016, we entered into a capital lease agreement for the property located in the Cre\u0301alys zoning at 5032 Isnes-Spy, Rue Phocas Lejeune 22, Gembloux cadastre, 8\nth\ndivision, Section B, n 55, Belgium.  The lease agreement provided that we made the first lease payment of $462,682 (\n\u20ac\n440,000), followed by quarterly lease payments of approximately $14,143 (\n\u20ac\n13,450), based on a fixed rate of 2.62% for the term of the lease. The present value of the minimum lease payments on both capital leases is $1,008,826 (\n\u20ac\n959,371).\nWe intend to use our cash reserves to predominantly fund further research and development activities. We do not currently have any substantial source of revenues and expect to rely on additional future financing, through the sale of additional equity securities, but there is no assurance that we will be successful in raising further funds.\nIn the event that additional financing is delayed, we will prioritize the maintenance of its research and development personnel and facilities, primarily in Belgium, and the maintenance of its patent rights. However the completion of clinical validation studies and regulatory approval processes for the purpose of bringing products to the IVD market would be delayed. In the event of an ongoing lack of financing, it may be necessary to discontinue operations, which will adversely affect the value of our common stock.\n33\nResults of Operations\nComparison of the Years Ended December 31, 2016 and December 31, 2015\nThe following table sets forth our results of operations for the year ended on December 31, 2016 and the comparative period for the year ended December 31, 2015.\nYear\nYear\nEnded\nEnded\nPercentage\nDecember 31,\nDecember 31,\nIncrease\/\nIncrease\/\n2016\n2015\nDecrease\nDecrease\n($)\n($)\n($)\n(%)\nRevenues\n-\n-\n-\n-\nGeneral and administrative\n(741,655)\n(669,016)\n72,639\n10.9%\nProfessional fees\n(2,366,057)\n(1,606,259)\n759,798\n47.3%\nSalaries & office administration fees\n(2,321,376)\n(1,628,726)\n692,650\n42.5%\nResearch and development\n(6,837,515)\n(6,101,718)\n735,797\n12.1%\nTotal Operating Expenses\n(12,266,603)\n(10,005,719)\n2,260,884\n22.6%\nNet Other Income\n361,325\n470,873\n(109,548)\n(23.3%)\nIncome Taxes\n-\n4,604\n(4,604)\n(100.0%)\nNet Loss\n(11,905,278)\n(9,530,242)\n2,375,036\n24.9%\nBasic and Diluted Loss Per Common Share\n(0.52)\n(0.54)\n0.02\n(4.3%)\nWeighted Average Basic and Diluted Common Shares Outstanding\n23,049,089\n17,731,809\n5,317,280\n30.0%\nRevenues\nOur operations are still predominantly in the development stage.\nOperating Expenses\nOur total operating expenses increased by $2,260,884, or 22.6%, in 2016 compared to 2015. Total expenses are comprised of general and administrative expenses, professional fees, salaries and administrative fees and research and development expenses.\nGeneral and administrative expenses\nOur general and administrative expenses increased $72,639, or 10.9%, in 2016 compared to 2015. A large proportion of this increase is due to increased investor relations related travel and conference attendance expenses of $27,320, alongside an increase in insurance costs of $57,244.\nProfessional fees\nOur professional fees increased $759,798, or 47.3%, in 2016 compared to 2015. During both years we incurred significant costs in relation to the multiple public offerings and other corporate matters. During 2016, there was (i) a decrease in legal and stock market listing fees of $56,459, as the initial up-listing to NYSE MKT in 2015 was relatively more costly, (ii) an increase of marketing & branding services of $369,824, to raise our profile, (iii) an increase of $323,556 in accounting costs & consulting fees and (iv) an increase of $71,029 for investor relations fees.\n34\nSalaries and office administration fees\nOur salaries and office administration fees increased $692,650, or 42.5%, in 2016 compared to 2015. This is mainly explained by an increase in equity plan option and warrants amortization of $184,312, alongside an increase in salaries and fees of $395,713. There was additional compensation for our senior executives and the appointment of an additional director and additional senior officers in 2016.\nResearch and development\nOur research and development costs increased $735,797, or 12.1%, in 2016 compared to 2015. The Hvidovre Hospital study has incurred additional costs of $503,726, as a new CRC related study was initiated in 2016. Additional studies and research contracts increased costs by $309,995. Antibody and sample costs decreased by $209,384, due to the development and usage of antibodies varying year on year. An increase in equity plan option amortization costs and salaries for research and development resources of $173,465 also contributed to the change.\nNet other income\nWe recognized net other income of $361,325 in 2016, a decrease of 23.3%, compared to net other income of $470,873 in 2015. In 2016, net other income consisted of $361,325 in grant funds received from public bodies in respect of approved expenditures, where there is no obligation to repay. In 2015, net other income mainly consisted of $146,812 in grant funds and a gain of $339,744 on the re-measurement of a derivative liability.\nNet Loss\nOur net loss increased $2,375,036, or 24.9%, in 2016 compared to 2015. The change is a result of the factors described above.\nGoing Concern\nWe have not attained profitable operations and are dependent upon obtaining financing to pursue any extensive activities. For these reasons, the auditors stated in their report on the audited financial statements that they have substantial doubt that we will be able to continue as a going concern without further financing.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nWe have no significant off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources that are material to stockholders.\nCritical Accounting Policies\nOur financial statements and accompanying notes have been prepared in accordance with United States generally accepted accounting principles applied on a consistent basis. The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods.\nWe regularly evaluate the accounting policies and estimates that we use to prepare our financial statements. A complete summary of these policies is included in the notes to our financial statements. In general, management\u0092s estimates are based on historical experience, on information from third party professionals, and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the facts and circumstances. Actual results could differ from those estimates made by management.\nContractual Obligations\nNot applicable.\n35\nRecently Issued Accounting Pronouncements\nThe Company has implemented all new accounting pronouncements that are in effect. The Company does not believe that there are any other new accounting pronouncements that have been issued that might have a material impact on its financial position or results of operations.","60":"","61":"ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT\u2019S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nYou should read the following discussion and analysis of our results of operations and financial condition for the years ended\nDecember 31, 2016\nand\nDecember 31, 2015\n, successor period from October 25, 2014 through December 31, 2014 and the predecessor period from January 1, 2014 through October 24, 2014 with the audited consolidated financial statements and related notes included elsewhere herein. The following discussion and analysis contains forward-looking statements that reflect our plans, estimates and beliefs, and which involve numerous risks and uncertainties, including, but not limited to, the risks and uncertainties described in Item 1A, \u201cRisk Factors.\u201d Actual results may differ materially from those contained in any forward-looking statements. See \u201cForward-Looking and Cautionary Statements.\u201d\nOverview and Outlook\nMPM Holdings Inc. (\u201cMomentive\u201d) and\nMomentive Performance Materials Inc. (\u201cMPM\u201d), both Delaware corporations, together with their subsidiaries (collectively referred to herein as \u201cwe,\u201d \u201cus,\u201d \u201cour,\u201d or the \u201cCompany\u201d), are one of the world\u2019s largest producers of silicones, silicone derivatives and organofunctional silanes and a global leader in the development and manufacture of products derived from quartz and specialty ceramics. Silicones are a multi-functional family of materials used in a wide variety of products and serve as a critical ingredient in many construction, transportation, healthcare, personal care, electronic, consumer and agricultural uses. Silicones and silanes are generally used as additives to a wide variety of end products in order to provide or enhance certain of their attributes, such as resistance (heat, ultraviolet light and chemical), lubrication, adhesion or viscosity. Some of the most well-known end-use product applications include bath and shower caulk, pressure-sensitive adhesive labels, polyurethane foam products, cosmetics and tires. Due to the versatility and high-performance characteristics of silicones and silanes, they are increasingly being used as a substitute for other materials. Our Quartz business manufactures quartz, specialty ceramics and crystal products for use in a number of high-technology industries, which typically require products made to precise specifications. The cost of our products typically represents a small percentage of the overall cost of our customers\u2019 products.\nWe serve more than 4,000 customers between our Silicones and Quartz businesses in over 100 countries. Our customers include leading companies in their respective industries.\nChapter 11 Bankruptcy and Emergence\nOn April 13, 2014, the Debtors filed voluntary petitions for reorganization under Chapter 11 of the Bankruptcy Code in the Court. The Chapter 11 proceedings were jointly administered under the caption\nIn re MPM Silicones, LLC, et al., Case No. 14-22503\n. During the bankruptcy proceedings, we continued to operate our business as \u201cdebtors-in-possession\u201d under the jurisdiction of the Court and in accordance with the applicable provisions of the Bankruptcy Code and orders of the Court until MPM\u2019s emergence from the Chapter 11 proceedings on October 24, 2014 (the \u201cEffective Date\u201d).\nOn September 11, 2014, the Court confirmed the Plan, and on the Effective Date the Plan became effective and MPM emerged from the Chapter 11 proceedings. Upon emergence, we reduced our total aggregate debt obligations from approximately $3.2 billion at December 31, 2013 to approximately $1.2 billion at December 31, 2014, and reduced our annual cash interest payments from nearly $300 to approximately $58. As of\nDecember 31, 2016\n, we had\n$2,606\nof total assets,\n$2,122\nof total liabilities, and\n$484\nof total equity.\nReportable Segments\nOur business segments are based on the products that we offer and the markets that we serve. At\nDecember 31, 2016\n, we had two reportable segments: Silicones and Quartz.\nThe Company's organizational structure continues to evolve. We are also continuing to refine our business and operating structure to better align our services to our customers and improve our cost position, while continuing to invest in global growth opportunities.\n2016\nOverview\n\u2022\nNet Sales\u2014\nNet sales in\n2016\nwere\n$2,233\n, a decrease of\n2%\ncompared with\n$2,289\nin\n2015\n. This decrease was primarily due to volume decrease of $42 in line with our intentional efforts to reduce under-performing siloxane derivative products, as well as negative price and mix shift of $16, caused by declines in oil and gas markets. In addition, there were favorable exchange rate fluctuations of $2 due to the weakening of the U.S. dollar against other currencies.\n\u2022\nNet Loss\u2014\nNet loss in\n2016\nwas\n$163\nand\n$161\nfor Momentive and MPM, respectively, an increase of\n$80\nand\n$79\n, respectively, compared to\n$83\nand\n$82\n, respectively in\n2015\n. This was due to lower sales, higher selling, general and administrative expense, higher restructuring and other costs, and higher other operating expense offset by lower cost of sales.\n\u2022\nSegment EBITDA\u2014\nSegment EBITDA in\n2016\nwas\n$238\nand\n$240\nfor Momentive and MPM, respectively, an increase of\n$44\nand\n$45\n, respectively, compared to\n$194\nand\n$195\n, respectively in\n2015\n. This increase was primarily due to improved demand in automotive and electronics market, production efficiencies, and raw material deflation.\n\u2022\nRecently completed initiatives include.\n\u25aa\nThe expansion of our Leverkusen, Germany facility serving liquid silicone rubber customers throughout Europe in the automotive, aerospace, energy, healthcare and consumer products industries.\n31\nTable of Contents\n\u2022\nFuture growth initiatives include.\n\u25aa\nThe expansion of our capability to manufacture\nNXT*\nsilane, which is an innovative product used in the production of tires, and can offer tire manufacturers the ability to reduce rolling resistance without loss of wet traction, as well as deliver benefits in the tire manufacturing process. This expansion will double our current\nNXT*\nsilane manufacturing capacity and is expected to be completed in 2017.\n2017\nOutlook\nAs we look into\n2017\n, we expect continued growth in demand in our specialty silicones businesses, particularly as we continue our investment in developing new products to support future growth.  We anticipate that our first quarter volumes and revenues will be similar to rates we experienced in the second half of 2016 and we anticipate growth in subsequent quarters due to improving global economic conditions.  We are well positioned to leverage our leadership positions, optimize our portfolio and invest in and drive new growth programs.  Additionally we expect 2017 sales results to reflect our intentional efforts to reduce under-performing siloxane derivative products and grow higher margin specialty portions of our portfolio.\nOur business is impacted by general economic and industrial conditions, including general industrial production, automotive builds, housing starts, construction activity, consumer spending and semiconductor capital equipment investment and these factors could have negative effects to our profitability and liquidity.  Our business has both geographic and end market diversity which often reduces the impact of any one of these factors on our overall performance.\nWe are continuing to invest in growth opportunities in our higher-growth product lines and geographical regions, and will leverage the combination of our proprietary technologies, strategic investments in key assets and leading presence in high-growth end markets to benefit as the global economy recovers and for long-term success.  We are also focused on gaining productivity efficiencies to reduce material costs and improve margins through investments in reliable and stable operations.  We continue to evaluate additional actions, as well as productivity measures, that could lead to further saving and such actions could result in more significant restructuring, exit and disposal costs and asset impairments in the future.\nPursuant to our earlier announcements during the fourth quarter of 2015 and as expanded in March and May of 2016, approximately $35\nin annual structural cost reduction initiatives through our global restructuring program have been implemented and have begun delivering savings, of which approximately $29\nwere delivered in\n2016\n.  At the same time, we initiated strategic actions to address our global siloxane manufacturing capacity including transformation of our Leverkusen, Germany facility by rationalizing siloxane capacity and making further investments in specialty assets through the\nNXT*\nsilanes expansion, which is on track.  In the fourth quarter of 2016, we completed the siloxane rationalization at our Leverkusen, Germany facility and it will reduce operating costs by approximately $10 per year.\n*\nNXT is a trademark of Momentive Performance Materials Inc.\nShared Services Agreement\nIn October 2010, we entered into a shared services agreement with Hexion (the \u201cShared Services Agreement\u201d), pursuant to which we provide to Hexion, and Hexion provides to us, certain services, including, but not limited to, executive and senior management, administrative support, human resources, information technology support, accounting, finance, legal and procurement services. The Shared Services Agreement was renewed for one year starting in October\n2016\nand is subject to termination by either us or Hexion, without cause, on not less than 30 days\u2019 written notice, and expires in October\n2017\n(subject to one-year renewals every year thereafter; absent contrary notice from either party). The Shared Services Agreement establishes certain criteria upon which the costs of such services are allocated between us and Hexion and requires that the Steering Committee formed under the agreement meet no less than annually to evaluate and determine an equitable allocation percentage. The allocation percentage is reviewed by the Steering Committee pursuant to the terms of the Shared Services Agreement.\nThe Shared Services Agreement has resulted in significant synergies for us, including shared services and logistics optimization, procurement savings, regional site rationalization and administrative and overhead savings. Despite the Bankruptcy Filing, the Shared Services Agreement has continued in effect along with the majority of the savings from these synergies. In conjunction with our emergence from Chapter 11 bankruptcy, on October 24, 2014, the Shared Services Agreement was amended to, among other things, (i) exclude the services of certain executive officers, (ii) provide for a transition assistance period at the election of the recipient following termination of the Shared Services Agreement of up to 12 months, subject to one successive renewal period of an additional 60 days and (iii) provide for the use of an independent third-party audit firm to assist the Steering Committee with its annual review of billings and allocations.\nMatters Impacting Comparability of Results\nFresh Start Accounting\nMomentive became the indirect parent company of MPM in accordance with the Plan upon MPM\u2019s emergence from Chapter 11 on October 24, 2014 (the \u201cEffective Date\u201d). As a result of the application of fresh start accounting, at the Effective Date, our assets and liabilities were recorded at their estimated fair values which, in some cases, are significantly different than amounts included in our financial statements prior to the Effective Date. Accordingly, our financial condition and results of operations on and after the Effective Date are not comparable to our financial condition and results of operations prior to the Effective Date.\n32\nTable of Contents\nDuring the application of fresh start accounting, we re-evaluated our accounting policy with respect to which overhead costs were production-related, as well as the extent to which functional costs supported production-related activities. As a result, certain costs were recorded in cost of sales rather than selling, general and administrative expense in the successor period.\nOther Comprehensive Income\nOur other comprehensive income is significantly impacted by foreign currency translation. The impact of foreign currency translation is driven by the translation of assets and liabilities of our foreign subsidiaries which are denominated in functional currencies other than the U.S. dollar. The primary assets and liabilities driving the adjustments are cash and cash equivalents; accounts receivable; inventory; property, plant and equipment; goodwill and other intangible assets; accounts payable and pension and other postretirement benefit obligations. The primary currencies in which these assets and liabilities are denominated are the euro and Japanese yen. Prior to October 24, 2014, other comprehensive income included the impact of defined benefit pension and postretirement benefit adjustments. Upon the application of fresh start accounting, beginning on and after October 24, 2014, actuarial gains and losses resulting from pension and postretirement liability re-measurements are recognized immediately in the unaudited Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations, compared to our prior policy of deferring such gains and losses in accumulated other comprehensive income and amortizing them over future periods. The impact of defined benefit pension and postretirement benefit adjustments prior to October 24, 2014 were primarily driven by unrecognized actuarial gains and losses related to our defined benefit and other postretirement benefit plans, as well as the subsequent amortization of gains and losses from accumulated other comprehensive income in periods following the initial recording of such items. These actuarial gains and losses were determined using various assumptions, the most significant of which were (i) the weighted average rate used for discounting the liability, (ii) the weighted average expected long-term rate of return on pension plan assets, (iii) the weighted average rate of future salary increases and (iv) the anticipated mortality rate tables.\nRaw Materials\nIn\n2016\n, we purchased approximately $846 of raw materials. The largest raw material used in our Silicones business is silicon metal. The cost of silicon metal comprised approximately 21% of our total raw material costs in our Silicones' manufacturing processes in\n2016\n. Raw materials continue to trend favorably for us and for silicon metal industry and we have continually worked to review our existing global supply agreements to seek more favorable terms and we expect to significantly benefit year on year from improved raw material pricing in\n2017.\nThe largest raw material used in our Quartz business is a specific type of sand, which is currently available from a limited number of suppliers. Because Unimin controls a significant amount of the quartz sand market, it exercises significant control over quartz sand prices, which have been steadily increasing. In April 2015, we entered into a purchase agreement with Unimin, which expired on December 31, 2016. We are currently negotiating the terms of a new long term supply agreement with Unimin, and expect to enter into an agreement within the first half of 2017. Since the expiration of our agreement with Unimin, purchases from Unimin have been handled through purchase orders without disruption of supply to our Quartz business and we expect that process to continue if we are unable to enter into a new agreement\nWe expect long-term raw material cost fluctuations to continue because of price movements of key feedstocks. To help mitigate the fluctuations in raw material pricing, we have purchase and sale contracts and commercial arrangements with many of our vendors and customers that contain periodic price adjustment mechanisms. Due to differences in the timing of pricing mechanism trigger points between our sales and purchase contracts, there is often a \u201clead-lag\u201d impact. In many cases this \u201clead-lag\u201d impact can negatively impact our margins in the short term in periods of rising raw material prices and positively impact them in the short term in periods of falling raw material prices.\n33\nTable of Contents\nResults of Operations\nCONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF OPERATIONS\nMPM HOLDINGS INC.\nSuccessor\nPredecessor\nYear Ended December 31, 2016\nYear Ended December 31, 2015\nPeriod from October 25, 2014 through December 31, 2014\nPeriod from January 1, 2014 through October 24, 2014\n(\nIn millions\n)\nNet sales\n$2,233\n$2,289\n$465\n$2,011\nCost of sales\n1,845\n1,894\n402\nGross profit\n388\n395\n63\nCost of sales, excluding depreciation and amortization\n1,439\nSelling, general and administrative expense\n347\n285\n80\n434\nDepreciation and amortization expense\n147\nResearch and development expense\n64\n65\n13\n63\nRestructuring and other costs\n42\n32\n5\n20\nOther operating loss (income), net\n19\n2\n(1\n)\n\u2014\nOperating (loss) income\n(84\n)\n11\n(34\n)\n(92\n)\nOperating (loss) income as a percentage of net sales\n(4\n)%\n\u2014%\n(7\n)%\n(5\n)%\nInterest expense, net\n76\n79\n15\n162\nOther non-operating expense, net\n(7\n)\n3\n8\n\u2014\nGain on extinguishment of debt\n(9\n)\n(7\n)\n\u2014\n\u2014\nReorganization items, net\n2\n8\n3\n(1,972\n)\nTotal non-operating expense (income)\n62\n83\n26\n(1,810\n)\n(Loss) income before income taxes and earnings from unconsolidated entities\n(146\n)\n(72\n)\n(60\n)\n1,718\nIncome tax expense\n18\n13\n\u2014\n36\n(Loss) income before earnings from unconsolidated entities\n(164\n)\n(85\n)\n(60\n)\n1,682\nEarnings from unconsolidated entities, net of taxes\n1\n2\n\u2014\n3\nNet (loss) income\n$(163\n)\n$(83\n)\n$(60\n)\n$1,685\nOther comprehensive income (loss)\n$16\n$(64\n)\n$(28\n)\n$(202\n)\n34\nTable of Contents\nMOMENTIVE PERFORMANCE MATERIALS INC.\nSuccessor\nPredecessor\n(\nIn millions\n)\nYear Ended December 31, 2016\nYear Ended December 31, 2015\nPeriod from October 25, 2014 through December 31, 2014\nPeriod from January 1, 2014 through October 24, 2014\nNet sales\n$2,233\n$2,289\n$465\n$2,011\nCost of sales\n1,845\n1,894\n402\nGross profit\n388\n395\n63\nCost of sales, excluding depreciation and amortization\n1,439\nSelling, general and administrative expense\n345\n284\n80\n434\nDepreciation and amortization expense\n147\nResearch and development expense\n64\n65\n13\n63\nRestructuring and other costs\n42\n32\n5\n20\nOther operating loss (income), net\n19\n2\n(1\n)\n\u2014\nOperating (loss) income\n(82\n)\n12\n(34\n)\n(92\n)\nOperating (loss) income as a percentage of net sales\n(4\n)%\n1%\n(7\n)%\n(5\n)%\nInterest expense, net\n76\n79\n15\n162\nOther non-operating expense, net\n(7\n)\n3\n8\n\u2014\nGain on extinguishment of debt\n(9\n)\n(7\n)\n\u2014\n\u2014\nReorganization items, net\n2\n8\n3\n(1,972\n)\nTotal non-operating expense (income)\n62\n83\n26\n(1,810\n)\n(Loss) income before income taxes and earnings from unconsolidated entities\n(144\n)\n(71\n)\n(60\n)\n1,718\nIncome tax expense\n18\n13\n\u2014\n36\n(Loss) income before earnings from unconsolidated entities\n(162\n)\n(84\n)\n(60\n)\n1,682\nEarnings from unconsolidated entities, net of taxes\n1\n2\n\u2014\n3\nNet (loss) income\n$(161\n)\n$(82\n)\n$(60\n)\n$1,685\nOther comprehensive income (loss)\n$16\n$(64\n)\n$(28\n)\n$(202\n)\nNet Sales\nIn\n2016\n, net sales decreased by\n$56\n, or\n2%\n, compared to\n2015\n. This decrease was primarily due to volume decrease of $42 in line with our intentional efforts to reduce under-performing siloxane derivative products,  as well as negative price and mix shift of $16, caused by declines in oil and gas markets. In addition, there were favorable exchange rate fluctuations of $2 due to the weakening of the U.S. dollar against other currencies.\nIn 2015, net sales decreased by $187, or 8%, compared to 2014. This decrease was primarily due to unfavorable exchange rate fluctuations of $156 due to the strengthening of the U.S. dollar against the euro and Japanese yen during 2015 as compared to 2014, as well as negative price and mix shift, which negatively impacted net sales by $46 caused by economic downturns in China, slowness in Asian high end automotive markets and a downturn in the oil and gas market. These decreases were partially offset by volume increases of $17.\n35\nTable of Contents\nOperating (Loss) Income\n2016\nvs\n2015\nOperating Results\nIn\n2016\n, operating income decreased by\n$95\nand $94\nfor Momentive and MPM, respectively, from an operating income of\n$11\nand $12\n, respectively to an operating loss of $84\nand $82\n, respectively. Cost of sales decreased by\n$49\ncompared to\n2015\nprimarily due to a decrease in net processing costs of\n$80\n, partially offset by\n$35\nin accelerated depreciation primarily related to certain long-lived assets mainly triggered by siloxane capacity transformation programs in Germany.\nSelling, general and administrative expense increased by $62\nand $61\nfor Momentive and MPM, respectively, compared to\n2015\nprimarily due to $49 in re-measurement of our pension and other postretirement liabilities. The incremental increase was driven by increased merit and incentive compensation, partially offset by various cost reduction actions. Research and development expense for\n2016\ndecreased by $1 compared to\n2015\nprimarily related to the timing of new projects.\nRestructuring and other costs for\n2016\nincreased by\n$10\ncompared to\n2015\nmainly due to costs arising from a fire at our Leverkusen, Germany facility and $13 for one-time costs triggered by the siloxane capacity transformation programs. These were partially offset by $11 in reduced severance costs compared to\n2015.\nOther operating expense increased by\n$17\n, primarily due to an increase of $11 in impairments and disposals of certain assets and equipment. In addition, in\n2015\nthere was a settlement gain of $6 related to the resolution of a customer dispute.\n2015 vs 2014 Operating Results\nIn 2015, operating income increased $137 and $138, for Momentive and MPM, respectively, from an operating loss of $126 to an operating income of $11 and $12, respectively, for Momentive and MPM, respectively. Cost of sales (excluding depreciation and amortization of $105 and $14 in the successor year ended December 31, 2015 and successor period from October 25, 2014 through December 31, 2014, respectively, due to the change in presentation of depreciation and amortization, as described in Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements) decreased by $38 compared to 2014. In conjunction with the application of fresh start accounting, we re-evaluated our accounting policy with respect to which overhead costs were production-related, as well as the extent to which functional costs supported production-related activities. As a result, in the Successor period, certain costs were recorded in cost of sales rather than in selling, general and administrative expense. In addition, in 2014, $35 of non cash one-time costs related to fresh start accounting were recorded in cost of sales. Cost of sales was positively impacted by favorable exchange rate fluctuations of $115 driven by the strengthening of the U.S. dollar against the euro and Japanese yen and production mix of $13. This reduction in cost of sales was partially offset by higher net processing costs of $15.\nSelling, general and administrative expense (excluding depreciation and amortization of $48 and $8 in the successor year ended December 31, 2015 and period from October 25, 2014 through December 31, 2014, respectively, due to the presentation change discussed above) decreased by $269 and $270 for Momentive and MPM, respectively, compared to 2014. As discussed above, in 2015, certain costs which previously had been recorded in selling, general and administrative expense are being recorded in cost of sales. Additionally, selling, general and administrative expense benefited from favorable exchange rate fluctuations of $25 as discussed above and $31 related to the re-measurement of our pension and other postretirement liabilities. Selling, general and administrative expense in 2014 included foreign currency losses of approximately $94 related to certain intercompany arrangements for which we were unable to assert permanent reinvestment during the Predecessor period due to the substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern under our prior capital structure.\nDepreciation and amortization expense during 2015 was $153 compared to $169 in 2014. Depreciation and amortization expense in 2014 included $12 of accelerated depreciation related to certain long-lived assets that were disposed of before the end of their estimated useful lives. Research and development expense for 2015 decreased by $11compared to 2014 primarily related to the timing of new projects. Restructuring and other costs for 2015 increased by $7 compared to 2014 which was primarily due to severance benefits related to the global restructuring announced in November 2015.\nNon-Operating Expense (Gain)\nIn\n2016\n, total non-operating expense decreased by\n$21\n, from an expense of $83\nto an expense of $62\n, compared to\n2015\n. The decrease was primarily due to a gain of $9 related to recovery of a tax claim from GE, $6 due to lower reorganization expense in 2016 and $3 in lower interest expense.\nIn 2015, total non-operating expense increased by $1,867, from an income of $1,784 to an expense of $83, compared to 2014. The increase was primarily driven by reorganization income items, net of $1,969 in 2014 (see Note 4 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of Part II of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for more information). This increase was offset by a decrease in interest expense of $98, which was primarily due to a reduction in total debt outstanding as a result of restructuring our capital structure in conjunction with the implementation of the Plan.\nIncome Tax Expense\nIn 2016, income tax expense increased by\n$5\ncompared to 2015. The effective income tax rate was (13%) for 2016 compared to (18%) for 2015. The change in the effective tax rate was primarily attributable to the amount and distribution of income and loss among the various jurisdictions in which we operate. The effective tax rate was also impacted by the movement in the valuation allowance. The valuation allowance, which relates principally to U.S. and certain non-U.S. deferred tax assets, was established and maintained based on our assessment that a portion\n36\nTable of Contents\nof the deferred tax assets will likely not be realized. Due to fluctuations in pre-tax income or loss between jurisdictions with and without a valuation allowance established, our historical effective tax rates are likely not indicative of our future effective tax rates.\nIn 2015, income tax expense decreased by $23 compared to 2014. The effective income tax rate was (18%) for 2015 compared to 2% for 2014. The change in the effective tax rate was primarily attributable to the amount and distribution of income and loss among the various jurisdictions in which we operate. The effective tax rate was also impacted by the tax impact of the reorganization and fresh start accounting net of the movement in valuation allowance. The valuation allowance, which relates principally to U.S. and certain non-U.S. deferred tax assets, was established and maintained based on our assessment that a portion of the deferred tax assets will likely not be realized.\nFor 2016, profits and losses incurred in foreign jurisdictions with statutory tax rates less than 35% (primarily China, Germany and Thailand) comprised the largest portion of the foreign rate differential. For 2015, China comprised the largest portion of the foreign rate differential. For 2014, Germany comprised the largest portion of the foreign rate differential.\nWe are recognizing the earnings of non-U.S. operations currently in our U.S. consolidated income tax return as of December 31, 2016 and are expecting that, with the exception of Germany and Japan, all earnings will be repatriated to the United States. We have accrued the incremental tax expense expected to be incurred upon the repatriation of these earnings. In addition, we have certain intercompany arrangements that, if settled, may trigger taxable gains or losses based on foreign currency exchange rates in place at the time of settlement. As a result, we are asserting permanent reinvestment with respect to certain intercompany arrangements considered indefinite.\nOther Comprehensive (Loss) Income\nFor the year ended December 31,\n2016\n, pension and postretirement benefit adjustments positively impacted other comprehensive income by\n$17\n, primarily due to the recognition of net prior service credit related to the effect of plan redesign triggered by certain changes to company sponsored post-retiree medical, dental, vision and life insurance benefit plans.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2015, foreign currency translation negatively impacted other comprehensive loss by $65, primarily due to the impact of the strengthening of the U.S. dollar against the euro. In 2015, pension and postretirement benefit negative impact on other comprehensive loss was $1 compared to $69 in 2014 due to the recognition of prior service costs in 2014 following provision changes to our U.S. pension plan.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2014, foreign currency translation negatively impacted other comprehensive income by $2, primarily due to the impact of the strengthening of the U.S. dollar against the euro and Japanese yen. For the year ended December 31, 2014, pension and postretirement benefit adjustments negatively impacted other comprehensive income by $70, primarily due to net unrecognized actuarial losses driven by a decrease in the discount rate at October 24, 2014, partially offset by favorable asset experience. In connection with the application of fresh start accounting, on October 24, 2014, total accumulated unrecognized net gains of $162 were eliminated from accumulated other comprehensive income (see Note 3 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of Part II of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for more information).\n37\nTable of Contents\nResults of Operations by Segment\nFollowing are net sales and Segment EBITDA by reportable segment. Segment EBITDA is defined as EBITDA (earnings before interest, income taxes, depreciation and amortization) adjusted for certain non-cash items and certain other income and expenses. Segment EBITDA is the primary performance measure used by our senior management, the chief operating decision-maker and the Board of Directors to evaluate operating results and allocate capital resources among segments. Segment EBITDA is also a principle profitability measure used to set management and executive incentive compensation goals. Segment EBITDA should not be considered a substitute for net income (loss) or other results reported in accordance with U.S. GAAP. Segment EBITDA may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies.\nIn 2015, we redefined our internal reporting structure and now allocate additional administrative functional costs to the operating segments. The current presentation of Segment EBITDA includes a Corporate component rather than the Other component previously disclosed. Corporate is primarily corporate, general and administrative expenses that are not allocated to the segments, such as certain shared service and administrative functions. Segment EBITDA for all periods presented was retrospectively revised to conform with the current presentation.\nMPM HOLDINGS INC.\nSuccessor\nPredecessor\nYear Ended December 31, 2016\nYear Ended December 31, 2015\nPeriod from October 25, 2014 through December 31, 2014\nPeriod from January 1, 2014 through October 24, 2014\nNet Sales\n(1)\n.\nSilicones\n$2,061\n$2,112\n$431\n$1,866\nQuartz\n172\n177\n34\n145\nTotal\n$2,233\n$2,289\n$465\n$2,011\nSegment EBITDA.\nSilicones\n(2)\n$257\n$201\n$44\n$213\nQuartz\n20\n27\n6\n17\nCorporate\n(39\n)\n(34\n)\n(4\n)\n(38\n)\nTotal\n$238\n$194\n$46\n$192\nMOMENTIVE PERFORMANCE MATERIALS INC.\nSuccessor\nPredecessor\nYear Ended December 31, 2016\nYear Ended December 31, 2015\nPeriod from October 25, 2014 through December 31, 2014\nPeriod from January 1, 2014 through October 24, 2014\nNet Sales\n(1)\n.\nSilicones\n$2,061\n$2,112\n$431\n$1,866\nQuartz\n172\n177\n34\n145\nTotal\n$2,233\n$2,289\n$465\n$2,011\nSegment EBITDA.\nSilicones\n(2)\n$257\n$201\n$44\n$213\nQuartz\n20\n27\n6\n17\nCorporate\n(37\n)\n(33\n)\n(4\n)\n(38\n)\nTotal\n$240\n$195\n$46\n$192\n(1)\nInter-segment sales are not significant and, as such, are eliminated within the selling segment.\n38\nTable of Contents\n2016\nvs.\n2015\nSegment Results\nFollowing is an analysis of the percentage change in sales by segment from\n2015\nto\n2016\n.\nVolume\nPrice\/Mix\nCurrency\nTranslation\nTotal\nSilicones\n(1\n)%\n(1\n)%\n\u2014%\n(2\n)%\nQuartz\n(4\n)%\n\u2014%\n1%\n(3\n)%\nSilicones\nNet sales in\n2016\ndecreased\n$51\n, or\n2%\n, compared to\n2015\n.

For the years ended December 31, 2016 and December 31, 2015, the successor period from October 25, 2014 through December 31, 2014 and the predecessor period from January 1, 2014 through October 24, 2014, these charges primarily represented net realized and unrealized foreign currency transaction losses and losses on the disposal and impairment of certain assets. For the years ended December 31, 2016 and December 31, 2015, these charges also include stock based compensation expenses.\nUnrealized gains (losses) on pension and postretirement benefits represented non-cash actuarial losses recognized upon the re-measurement of our pension and postretirement benefit obligations, which after the Effective Date, are recognized in the Consolidated Statements of Operations, and were driven by a decrease in discount rates, other demographic assumptions and asset performance. Restructuring and other costs for all periods primarily included expenses from our restructuring and cost optimization programs. For the year ended December 31, 2016, these amounts also included costs arising from the union strikes inclusive of unfavorable manufacturing variances at our Waterford, NY and Willoughby, OH facilities, costs due to a fire at our Leverkusen, Germany facility, and recovery of Italian tax claims from GE. For the predecessor period from January 1, 2014 through October 24, 2014, these amounts also included costs associated with restructuring the Company\u2019s capital structure incurred prior to the Bankruptcy Filing, and were partially offset by a gain related to a claim settlement. Reorganization items, net represented incremental costs incurred directly as a result of the Bankruptcy Filing. For the successor years ended December 31, 2016 and December 31, 2015, successor period from October 25, 2014 through December 31 2014, these amounts were primarily related to certain professional fees. For the predecessor period from January 1, 2014 through October 24, 2014, these amounts included certain professional fees, the BCA Commitment Premium and financing fees related to our DIP Facilities, as well as the impact of the Reorganization Adjustments and the Fresh Start Adjustments (see Note 3).\n41\nTable of Contents\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nOur primary sources of liquidity are cash on hand, cash flows from operations and funds available under the ABL Facility. Our primary continuing liquidity needs are to finance our working capital, debt service and capital expenditures.\nAt\nDecember 31, 2016\n, we had\n$1,203\nof indebtedness. In addition, at\nDecember 31, 2016\n, we had\n$439\nin liquidity consisting of the following.\n\u2022\n$224\nof unrestricted cash and cash equivalents (of which $184 is maintained in foreign jurisdictions); and\n\u2022\n$215\nof availability under the ABL Facility ($270 borrowing base, less\n$55\nof outstanding letters of credit and subject to a fixed charge coverage ratio of 1.0 to 1.0 that will only apply if our availability is less than the greater of (a) 12.5% of the lesser of the borrowing base and the total ABL Facility commitments at such time and (b) $27).\nAs part of the Bankruptcy Filing, we and certain of our subsidiaries obtained the DIP Facilities.  The DIP Facilities were used in part to repay in full the outstanding obligations under our existing ABL facility (the \u201cOld ABL Facility\u201d). The DIP Facilities were comprised of a $270 asset-based revolving loan (the \u201cDIP ABL Facility\u201d) and a $300 term loan (the \u201cDIP Term Loan Facility\u201d). In conjunction with our emergence from Chapter 11 bankruptcy, on October 24, 2014, the DIP Term Loan Facility was paid in full and terminated, and the DIP ABL Facility was converted into the ABL Facility.\nIn addition, in the fourth quarter of 2015 and first quarter of 2016, we initiated a debt buyback program and repurchased $48 in aggregate principal amount of our Second Lien Notes for approximately $26, resulting in a net gain of $16. All repurchased notes were canceled at the time of repurchase, reducing the aggregate principal amount of these notes outstanding from $250 at the end of third quarter of 2015 to $202 as of December 31, 2016.\nOur net working capital (defined as accounts receivable and inventories less accounts payable) at\nDecember 31, 2016\nand\n2015\nwas\n$432\nand\n$450\n, respectively. A summary of the components of our net working capital as of\nDecember 31, 2016\nand\n2015\nis as follows.\nDecember 31, 2016% of LTM Net Sales\nDecember 31, 2015% of LTM Net Sales\nAccounts receivable\n$280\n13%\n$292\n13%\nInventories\n390\n17%\n381\n17%\nAccounts payable\n(238\n)\n(11\n)%\n(223\n)\n(10\n)%\nNet working capital\n$432\n19%\n$450\n20%\nThe decrease in net working capital of\n$18\nfrom\nDecember 31, 2015\nwas due to various market driven factors: a decrease in accounts receivable due to lower sales, a higher mix of vendors with longer than average payment terms and the results of working capital optimization triggering a reduction in inventory costs. The decrease was offset by: strategic investment in profitable products, a safety stock increase to support our Leverkusen, Germany site transformation and due to the strike at our Waterford, NY site, and a higher mix of customers with longer than average payment terms.\nWe remain focused on driving positive free cash flow in\n2017\nthrough our global cost control initiatives and aggressively managing net working capital. To minimize the impact of net working capital on cash flows, we continue to review inventory safety stock levels where possible. We also continue to focus on receivable collections by accelerating receipts through the sale of receivables at a discount.\nWe have the ability to borrow from the ABL Facility to support our short-term liquidity requirements. During 2015 and 2016, we did not draw from our ABL Facility. As of\nDecember 31, 2016\n, we had no outstanding borrowings under the ABL Facility.\n2017\nOutlook\nFollowing, and as a result of, our emergence from the Chapter 11 proceedings, we believe we are favorably positioned to fund our ongoing liquidity requirements. We believe that due to our businesses operating cash flows as well as our\n$439\nof liquidity in the form of cash and our ABL facility, our long-term debt maturities in 2021 and 2022, and our annual debt service costs of approximately $54, our business has adequate capital resources to meet material commitments coming due during the next 12-month period. The additional liquidity provided by the rights offerings in connection with the Chapter 11 process (the \u201cRights Offerings\u201d) and the impact of the Plan on our capital structure, resulting in reduced annual debt service obligations of approximately $240, increased our future operational and financial flexibility and left us well positioned to make strategic capital investments, leverage our leadership positions with both our customers and suppliers, optimize our portfolio and drive new growth programs. Our business is impacted by general economic and industrial conditions, including general industrial production, automotive builds, housing starts, construction activity, consumer spending and semiconductor capital equipment investment, and these factors could have negative effects to our liquidity. Our business has both geographic and end market diversity, which often reduces the impact of any one of these factors on our overall performance.\nCapital spending in\n2017\nis expected to be approximately between $125 and $130, approximately $50 of which relates to certain growth and productivity projects. We continue to focus on optimizing our working capital and expect it to be a source of cash in\n2017.\n42\nTable of Contents\nWe expect to have adequate liquidity to fund our operations for the foreseeable future from cash on our balance sheet, cash flows provided by operating activities and amounts available for borrowings under the ABL Facility.\nDebt Repurchases and Other Transactions\nFrom time to time, depending upon market, pricing and other conditions, as well as on our cash balances and liquidity, we or our affiliates may seek to acquire (and have acquired) our outstanding equity and\/or debt securities or other indebtedness of the Company through open market purchases, privately negotiated transactions, tender offers, redemption or otherwise, upon such terms and at such prices as we or our affiliates may determine (or as may be provided for in the indentures governing our notes if applicable), for cash or other consideration. For example, in the fourth quarter of 2015 and first quarter of 2016, we repurchased $48 in aggregate principal amount of our Second Lien Notes for approximately $26, resulting in a net gain of $16. All repurchased notes were canceled at the time of repurchase, reducing the aggregate principal amount of these notes outstanding from $250 at the end of third quarter of 2015 to $202 as of December 31, 2016. In addition, we have considered and will continue to evaluate potential transactions to reduce net debt, such as debt for debt exchanges and other transactions. There can be no assurance as to which, if any, of these alternatives or combinations thereof we or our affiliates may choose to pursue in the future as the pursuit of any alternative will depend upon numerous factors such as market conditions, our financial performance and the limitations applicable to such transactions under our financing documents.\nSources and Uses of Cash\nFollowing are highlights from our Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows.\nMPM HOLDINGS INC.\nSuccessor\nPredecessor\nYear Ended December 31, 2016\nYear Ended December 31, 2015\nPeriod from October 25, 2014 through December 31, 2014\nPeriod from January 1, 2014 through October 24, 2014\nSources (uses) of cash.\nOperating activities\n$142\n$128\n$(3\n)\n$(207\n)\nInvesting activities\n(117\n)\n(116\n)\n(17\n)\n(18\n)\nFinancing activities\n(16\n)\n(10\n)\n(1\n)\n390\nEffect of exchange rates on cash flow\n(2\n)\n(8\n)\n(4\n)\n(6\n)\nNet (decrease) increase in cash and cash equivalents\n$7\n$(6\n)\n$(25\n)\n$159\nMOMENTIVE PERFORMANCE MATERIALS INC.\nSuccessor\nPredecessor\nYear Ended December 31, 2016\nYear Ended December 31, 2015\nPeriod from October 25, 2014 through December 31, 2014\nPeriod from January 1, 2014 through October 24, 2014\nSources (uses) of cash.\nOperating activities\n$144\n$129\n$(3\n)\n$(207\n)\nInvesting activities\n(118\n)\n(116\n)\n(17\n)\n(18\n)\nFinancing activities\n(17\n)\n(11\n)\n(1\n)\n390\nEffect of exchange rates on cash flow\n(2\n)\n(8\n)\n(4\n)\n(6\n)\nNet (decrease) increase in cash and cash equivalents\n$7\n$(6\n)\n$(25\n)\n$159\nOperating Activities\nIn\n2016\n, operations generated\n$142\nand $144\nof cash for Momentive and MPM, respectively.

Net income of $83 and $82 for Momentive and MPM, respectively, included $147 of net non-cash items, of which mainly $153 was for depreciation and amortization and $22 was for amortization of debt discount costs, offset primarily by $10 of unrealized foreign currency gains, $16 of unrealized gains related to the re-measurement and curtailment related to our pension liabilities and $7 related to gain on the extinguishment of debt. Net working capital generated $30 of cash driven by customer mix and timing of collections as well as a decrease in accounts payable due to longer payment terms with vendors following our emergence from Chapter 11. Changes in other assets and liabilities, due to\/from affiliates and income taxes payable are driven by the timing of when items were expensed versus paid, which primarily included interest expense, pension plan contributions and taxes.\nIn 2014, operations used $210 of cash. Net income of $1,625 included $1,755 of net non-cash income items, of which $2,078 was for non-cash reorganization items, which were partially offset by other various non-cash expenses. These other non-cash expenses included $169 for depreciation and amortization, a $19 reclassification of DIP Facility financing fees to \u201cFinancing Activities\u201d, a $15 non-cash charge for unrealized losses related to the re-measurement of our pension liabilities, $101 of unrealized foreign currency losses, $10 of deferred tax expense and $4 for the amortization of debt discount. Net working capital used $80 of cash primarily driven by increases in sales volumes and the related impact on accounts receivable and inventory, as well as a decrease in accounts payable of $14. Changes in other assets and liabilities, due to\/from affiliates and income taxes payable remained flat. These changes are driven by the timing of when items were expensed versus paid, which primarily included interest expense, pension plan contributions and taxes.\nInvesting Activities\nIn\n2016\n, investing activities used\n$117\nand $118\nof cash for Momentive and MPM, respectively. We spent $117 for ongoing capital expenditures related to growth, environmental, health and safety compliance and maintenance projects (represented by $125 in current year asset additions, reduced by the capital expenditure financed through accounts payable).\nIn 2015, investing activities used\n$116\nof cash. We spent $114 for ongoing capital expenditures (including capitalized interest) related to environmental, health and safety compliance and maintenance projects (of which $111 represented current year asset additions, with the remainder being the change in the accounts payable related to capital spending).\nIn 2014, investing activities used $88 of cash. We spent $96 for ongoing capital expenditures (including capitalized interest) related to environmental, health and safety compliance and maintenance projects (of which $87 represented current year asset additions, with the remainder being the change in the accounts payable related to capital spending). We also spent $2 on the acquisition of intangible assets. These expenditures were partially offset by the consolidation of Superholdco Finance Corp. (\u201cFinco\u201d), which provided a $50 increase in cash, as well as $12 in proceeds received from the sale of a subsidiary to Hexion.\nFinancing Activities\nIn\n2016\n, financing activities used\n$16\nand $17\nof cash for Momentive and MPM, respectively, mainly due to the buyback of $29 in aggregate principal amount of our Second Lien Notes for\n$16.\nIn 2015, financing activities used $10 and $11 of cash for Momentive and MPM, respectively, mainly due to the buyback of $19 in aggregate principal amount of our Second Lien Notes for $10.\nIn 2014, financing activities provided $389 of cash. Proceeds from the Rights Offerings provided cash of $600. Net long-term debt repayments were $135, which primarily consisted of net repayments under the Old ABL Facility and a $75 revolving credit facility (the \u201cCash Flow Facility\u201d), and net short-term debt repayments were $7. Additionally, the repayment of an affiliated loan in conjunction with various transactions with Finco used cash of $50. We also paid $19 in financing fees related to our DIP Facilities.\nAt\nDecember 31, 2016\n, there were\n$55\nin outstanding letters of credit and no borrowings outstanding under our $270 ABL Facility, leaving unused borrowing capacity of\n$215.\nThe credit agreement governing the ABL Facility contains various restrictive covenants that prohibit us and\/or restrict our ability to prepay indebtedness, including our First Lien Notes and Second Lien Notes (collectively, the \u201cnotes\u201d). In addition, the credit agreement governing the ABL Facility and the indentures governing our notes, among other things, restrict our ability to incur indebtedness or liens, make investments or declare or pay any dividends. However, all of these restrictions are subject to exceptions.\nThere are certain restrictions on the ability of certain of our subsidiaries to transfer funds to the parent of such subsidiaries in the form of cash dividends, loans or otherwise, which primarily arise as a result of certain foreign government regulations or as a result of restrictions within certain subsidiaries\u2019 financing agreements that limit such transfers to the amounts of available earnings and profits or otherwise limit the amount of dividends that can be distributed. In either case, we have alternative methods to obtain cash from these subsidiaries in the form of intercompany loans and\/or returns of capital in such instances where payment of dividends is limited to the extent of earnings and profits.\nWe are recognizing the earnings of non-U.S. operations currently in our U.S. consolidated income tax return as of December 31,\n2016\nand are expecting that, with the exception of Germany and Japan, all earnings will be repatriated to the United States. We have accrued the incremental tax expense expected to be incurred upon the repatriation of these earnings. In addition, we have certain intercompany arrangements that, if settled, may trigger taxable gains or losses based on foreign currency exchange rates in place at the time of settlement. As a result, are asserting permanent reinvestment with respect to certain intercompany arrangements considered indefinite.\n44\nTable of Contents\nCovenants Under the ABL Facility and the Notes\nThe instruments that govern our indebtedness contain, among other provisions, restrictive covenants (and incurrence tests in certain cases) regarding indebtedness, dividends and distributions, mergers and acquisitions, asset sales, affiliate transactions, capital expenditures and, under certain circumstances, the maintenance of a fixed charge coverage ratio, as further described below. Payment of borrowings under the ABL Facility and our notes may be accelerated if there is an event of default as determined under the governing debt instrument. Events of default under the credit agreement governing the ABL Facility include the failure to pay principal and interest when due, a material breach of a representation or warranty, events of bankruptcy, a change of control and most covenant defaults. Events of default under the indentures governing our notes include the failure to pay principal and interest, a failure to comply with covenants, subject to a 30-day grace period in certain instances, and certain events of bankruptcy.\nThe ABL Facility does not have any financial maintenance covenant other than a minimum fixed charge coverage ratio of 1.0 to 1.0 that would only apply if our availability under the ABL Facility at any time was less than the greater of (a) 12.5% of the lesser of the borrowing base and the total ABL Facility commitments at such time and (b) $27. The fixed charge coverage ratio is generally defined as the ratio of (a) Adjusted EBITDA minus non-financed capital expenditures and cash taxes to (b) debt service plus cash interest expense plus certain restricted payments, each measured on a last twelve months, or LTM, basis and calculated as of the last day of the applicable fiscal quarter.\nIn addition to the financial maintenance covenant described above, we are also subject to certain incurrence tests under the indentures governing our notes that restrict our ability to take certain actions if we are unable to meet specified ratios. For instance, the indentures governing our notes contain an incurrence test that restricts our ability to incur indebtedness or make investments, among other actions, if we do not maintain an Adjusted EBITDA to Fixed Charges ratio (measured on a LTM basis) of at least 2.0 to 1.0. The Adjusted EBITDA to Fixed Charges ratio under the indentures is generally defined as the ratio of (a) Adjusted EBITDA to (b) net interest expense excluding the amortization or write-off of deferred financing costs, each measured on a LTM basis. The restrictions on our ability to incur indebtedness or make investments under the indentures that apply as a result, however, are subject to exceptions, including exceptions that permit indebtedness under the ABL Facility.\nAt\nDecember 31, 2016\n, we were in compliance with all covenants under the credit agreement governing the ABL Facility and under the indentures governing the notes.\nAdjusted EBITDA is defined as EBITDA adjusted for certain non-cash and certain non-recurring items and other adjustments calculated on a pro-forma basis, including the expected future cost savings from business optimization or other programs and the expected future impact of acquisitions, in each case as determined under the governing debt instrument. As we are highly leveraged, we believe that including the supplemental adjustments that are made to calculate Adjusted EBITDA provides additional information to investors about our ability to comply with our financial covenants and to obtain additional debt in the future. Adjusted EBITDA is not a defined term under U.S. GAAP. Adjusted EBITDA is not a measure of financial condition, liquidity or profitability, and should not be considered as an alternative to net income (loss) determined in accordance with U.S. GAAP or operating cash flows determined in accordance with U.S. GAAP. Additionally, EBITDA is not intended to be a measure of free cash flow for management\u2019s discretionary use, as it does not take into account certain items such as interest and principal payments on our indebtedness, depreciation and amortization expense (because we use capital assets, depreciation and amortization expense is a necessary element of our costs and ability to generate revenue), working capital needs, tax payments (because the payment of taxes is part of our operations, it is a necessary element of our costs and ability to operate), non-recurring expenses and capital expenditures. Fixed Charges under the indentures should not be considered as an alternative to interest expense.\n45\nTable of Contents\nThe following table reconciles Net loss to EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA, and calculates the ratio of Adjusted EBITDA to Fixed Charges as calculated under our indentures for the period presented.\nYear Ended\nDecember 31, 2016\nNet loss\n$(161\n)\nInterest expense, net\n76\nGain on the extinguishment of debt\n(9\n)\nIncome tax expense\n18\nDepreciation and amortization\n185\nEBITDA\n109\nAdjustments to EBITDA.\nRestructuring and other costs\n(a)\n70\nReorganization items, net\n(b)\n2\nNon-cash compensation and related expenses\n(c)\n36\nPro forma cost savings from other initiatives\n(d)\n16\nOther non-cash charges and other income and expense\n(e)\n23\nExclusion of Unrestricted Subsidiary results\n(f)\n(33\n)\nAdjusted EBITDA\n$223\nPro forma fixed charges\n(g)\n$54\nRatio of Adjusted EBITDA to Fixed Charges\n(h)\n4.13\n(a)\nPrimarily includes one-time expenses related to our global restructuring program, siloxane production transformation, union strike and certain other non-operating income and expenses.\n(b)\nRepresents professional fees related to our reorganization.\n(c)\nRepresents non-cash actuarial losses resulting from pension and postretirement liability curtailment and re-measurements, and stock-based compensation expense.\n(d)\nRepresents estimated cost savings, on a pro forma basis, from initiatives implemented or being implemented by management, including headcount reductions and indirect cost savings.\n(e)\nNon-cash charges primarily include the effects of foreign exchange gains and losses and impacts of asset impairments and disposals.\n(f)\nReflects the exclusion of the EBITDA of our subsidiaries that are designated as Unrestricted Subsidiaries under the ABL Facility and the indentures that govern our notes.\n(g)\nReflects pro forma interest expense based on outstanding indebtedness and interest rates at\nDecember 31, 2016.\n(h)\nMPM\u2019s ability to incur additional indebtedness, among other actions, is restricted under the indentures governing our notes, unless MPM has an Adjusted EBITDA to Fixed Charges ratio of 2.0 to 1.0. As of\nDecember 31, 2016\n, we were able to satisfy this test and incur additional indebtedness under these indentures.\n46\nTable of Contents\nContractual Obligations\nThe following table presents our contractual cash obligations\nat\nDecember 31, 2016\n. Our contractual cash obligations consist of legal commitments at\nDecember 31, 2016\nthat require us to make fixed or determinable cash payments, regardless of the contractual requirements of the specific vendor to provide us with future goods or services. This table does not include information about most of our recurring purchases of materials used in our production; our raw material purchase contracts do not meet this definition since they generally do not require fixed or minimum quantities. Contracts with cancellation clauses are not included, unless a cancellation would result in a major disruption to our business. These contractual obligations are grouped in the same manner as they are classified in the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows in order to provide a better understanding of the nature of the obligations.\nPayments Due By Year\nContractual Obligations\n2017\n2018\n2019\n2020\n2021\n2022 and beyond\nTotal\nOperating activities.\nPurchase obligations\n(1)\n$127\n$111\n$97\n$91\n$72\n$352\n$850\nInterest on fixed rate debt obligations\n53\n52\n52\n52\n44\n3\n256\nOperating lease obligations\n15\n11\n9\n7\n6\n15\n63\nFunding of pension and other postretirement obligations\n(2)\n33\n29\n30\n31\n33\n156\nFinancing activities.\nLong-term debt, including current maturities\n(3)\n36\n\u2014\n\u2014\n\u2014\n1,100\n202\n1,338\nTotal\n$264\n$203\n$188\n$181\n$1,255\n$572\n$2,663\n(1)\nPurchase obligations are comprised of the fixed or minimum amounts of goods and\/or services under long-term contracts and assumes that certain contracts are terminated in accordance with their terms after giving the requisite notice which is generally two to three years for most of these contracts; however, under certain circumstances, some of these minimum commitment term periods could be further reduced which would significantly decrease these contractual obligations.\n(2)\nPension and other postretirement contributions have been included in the above table for the next five years. These amounts include estimated benefit payments to be made for unfunded foreign defined benefit pension plans as well as estimated contributions to our funded defined benefit plans. The assumptions used by our actuaries in calculating these projections includes a weighted average annual return on pension assets of approximately 6% for the years 2017 \u2013 2021 and the continuation of current law and plan provisions. These estimated payments may vary based on the actual return on our plan assets or changes in current law or plan provisions. See Note 15 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of Part II of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for more information on our pension and postretirement obligations.\n(3)\nLong-term debt amounts above represent gross repayments, and are exclusive of any unamortized debt discounts.\nThe table above excludes payments for income taxes and environmental obligations since, at this time, we cannot determine either the timing or the amounts of all payments beyond\n2016\nAt December 31,\n2016\n, we recorded unrecognized tax benefits and related interest and penalties of $45. We estimate that we will pay approximately $25\nin\n2017\nfor local, state and international income taxes. We expect non-capital environmental expenditures for\n2017\nthrough\n2021\ntotaling $25. See Notes 13 and 14 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of Part II of this Annual Report on 10-K for more information on these obligations.\n47\nTable of Contents\nCritical Accounting Estimates\nIn preparing our financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States, we have to make estimates and assumptions about future events that affect the amounts of reported assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, as well as the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities in the financial statements and accompanying notes. Some of these accounting policies require the application of significant judgment by management to select the appropriate assumptions to determine these estimates. By their nature, these judgments are subject to an inherent degree of uncertainty; therefore, actual results may differ significantly from estimated results. We base these judgments on our historical experience, advice from experienced consultants, forecasts and other available information, as appropriate. Our significant accounting policies are more fully described in Note 5 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of Part II of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nIncome Taxes\nIncome taxes are accounted for under the asset and liability method. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases and operating loss and tax credit carry forwards. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment dates. Deferred tax assets are subject to valuation allowances based upon management's estimates of realizability.\nAt December 31, 2016 and 2015, we had valuation allowances of $484 and $419, respectively, against our deferred income tax assets. At December 31, 2016, we had a $297 valuation allowance against a portion of our net U.S. federal and state deferred tax assets, as well as a valuation allowance of $187 against a portion of our net foreign deferred income tax assets, primarily in Germany and Japan. At December 31, 2015, we had a $243 valuation allowance against all of our net U.S. federal and state deferred tax assets, as well as a valuation allowance of $176 against a portion of our net foreign deferred income tax assets, primarily in Germany and Japan. The valuation allowances require an assessment of both negative and positive evidence, such as operating results during the most recent three-year period. This evidence is given more weight than our expectations of future profitability, which are inherently uncertain.\nWe considered all available evidence, both positive and negative, in assessing the need for a valuation allowance for deferred tax assets. The Company evaluated four possible sources of taxable income when assessing the realization of deferred tax assets.\n\u2022\nTaxable income in prior carryback years;\n\u2022\nFuture reversal of existing taxable temporary differences;\n\u2022\nTax planning strategies; and\n\u2022\nFuture taxable income exclusive of reversing temporary differences and carryforwards.\nThe accounting guidance for uncertainty in income taxes is recognized in the financial statements. The guidance prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of tax positions taken or expected to be taken in its tax return. We also apply the guidance relating to de-recognition, classification, interest and penalties, accounting in interim periods, disclosure and transition.\nThe calculation of our income tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex domestic and foreign income tax regulations. Unrecognized tax benefits are generated when there are differences between tax positions taken in a tax return and amounts recognized in the Consolidated Financial Statements.  Tax benefits are recognized in the Consolidated Financial Statements when it is more likely than not that a tax position will be sustained upon examination. Tax benefits are measured as the largest amount of benefit that is greater than 50% likely to be realized upon settlement. To the extent we prevail in matters for which liabilities have been established, or are required to pay amounts in excess of our liabilities, our effective income tax rate in a given period could be materially impacted. An unfavorable income tax settlement would require the use of cash and result in an increase in our effective income tax rate in the year it is resolved. A favorable income tax settlement would be recognized as a reduction in the effective income tax rate in the year of resolution. At December 31, 2016 and 2015, we recorded unrecognized tax benefits and related interest and penalties of $45 and $40, respectively.\nPensions\nThe amounts that we recognize in our financial statements for pension benefit obligations are determined by actuarial valuations. Inherent in these valuations are certain assumptions, the more significant of which are.\n\u2022\nThe weighted average rate used for discounting the liability;\n\u2022\nThe weighted average expected long-term rate of return on pension plan assets;\n\u2022\nThe method used to determine market-related value of pension plan assets;\n\u2022\nThe weighted average rate of future salary increases; and\n\u2022\nThe anticipated mortality rate tables.\nThe discount rate reflects the rate at which pensions could be effectively settled. When selecting a discount rate, our actuaries provide us with a cash flow model that uses the yields of high-grade corporate bonds with maturities consistent with our anticipated cash flow projections.\n48\nTable of Contents\nThe expected long-term rate of return on plan assets is determined based on the various plans\u2019 current and projected asset mix. To determine the expected overall long-term rate of return on assets, we take into account the rates on long-term debt investments that are held in the portfolio, as well as expected trends in the equity markets, for plans including equity securities.\nThe rate of increase in future compensation levels is determined based on salary and wage trends in the chemical and other similar industries, as well as our specific compensation targets.\nThe mortality tables that are used represent the best estimated mortality projections for each particular country and reflect projected mortality improvements.\nWe believe the current assumptions used to estimate plan obligations and pension expense are appropriate in the current economic environment. However, as economic conditions change, we may change some of our assumptions, which could have a material impact on our financial condition and results of operations.\nThe following table presents the sensitivity of our projected pension benefit obligation (\u201cPBO\u201d), accumulated benefit obligation (\u201cABO\u201d), equity (\u201cEquity\u201d) and\n2017\npension expense to the following changes in key assumptions.\nIncrease \/ (Decrease) at\nIncrease \/\n(Decrease)\nDecember 31, 2016\nPBO\nABO\nEquity\n2016 Expense\nAssumption.\nIncrease in discount rate of 0.5%\n$(37\n)\n$(35\n)\n$37\n$(1\n)\nDecrease in discount rate of 0.5%\n43\n40\n(43\n)\n1\nIncrease in estimated return on assets of 1.0%\n(2\n)\nDecrease in estimated return on assets of 1.0%\n$2\nImpairment of Long-Lived Assets, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets\nAs events warrant, we evaluate the recoverability of long-lived assets, other than goodwill and other indefinite-lived intangibles, by assessing whether the carrying value can be recovered over their remaining useful lives through the expected future undiscounted operating cash flows of the underlying asset groups. Impairment indicators include, but are not limited to, a significant decrease in the market price of a long-lived asset; a significant adverse change in the manner in which the asset is being used or in its physical condition; a significant adverse change in legal factors or the business climate that could affect the value of a long-lived asset; an accumulation of costs significantly in excess of the amount originally expected for the acquisition or construction of a long-lived asset; current period operating or cash flow losses combined with a history of operating or cash flow losses associated with the use of the asset; or a current expectation that it is more likely than not that a long-lived asset will be sold or otherwise disposed of significantly before the end of its previously estimated useful life. As a result, future decisions to change our manufacturing process, exit certain businesses, reduce excess capacity, temporarily idle facilities and close facilities could result in material impairment charges. Long-lived assets are grouped together at the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows are largely independent of cash flows of other groups of long-lived assets. Any impairment loss that may be required is determined by comparing the carrying value of the assets to their estimated fair value.\nWe perform an annual assessment of qualitative factors to determine whether the existence of any events or circumstances leads to a determination that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than the carrying amount of the reporting unit\u2019s net assets. If, after assessing all events and circumstances, we determine it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than the carrying amount of the reporting unit\u2019s net assets, we use a probability weighted market and income approach to estimate the fair value of the reporting unit. Our market approach is a comparable analysis technique commonly used in the investment banking and private equity industries based on the EBITDA multiple technique. Under this technique, estimated fair value is the result of a market based EBITDA multiple that is applied to an appropriate historical EBITDA amount, adjusted for the additional fair value that would be assigned by a market participant obtaining control over the reporting unit. Our income approach is a discounted cash flow model. The discounted cash flow model requires management to project revenues, operating expenses, working capital investment, capital spending and cash flows over a multiyear period, as well as determine the weighted average cost of capital to be used as a discount rate. Applying this discount rate to the multiyear projections provides an estimate of fair value for the reporting unit. The discounted cash flow model does not include cash flows related to interest payments and debt service, as the related debt has not been pushed down to the reporting unit level. Our reporting units are the same as our operating segments: Silicones and Quartz.\nAt October 1,\n2016\n, the fair value of the reporting units exceeded the respective carrying values by 9% to 46% (\"headroom\"). It is possible that the conclusions regarding the impairment or recoverability of goodwill at either reporting unit could change in future periods if, for example, the reporting unit does not perform as projected, the results of strategic plans and certain cost saving initiatives are not fully achieved, or the overall economic or business conditions are worse than current assumptions (including inputs to the discount rate or market based EBITDA multiples).  If our assumptions and related estimates change in the future, or if we change our reporting structure or other events and circumstances change, we may be required to record impairment charges in future periods. Any impairment charges that we may take in the future could be material to our results of operations and financial condition.\n49\nTable of Contents\nThe Quartz reporting unit, which had headroom of 9%, was the only reporting unit with fair value in excess of carrying value of less than 20%. As of December 31, 2016, the carrying value of goodwill assigned to the Quartz reporting unit was $18. Management will continue to monitor this reporting unit for changes in the business environment that could impact recoverability.\nFresh Start Accounting\nThe application of fresh start accounting requires that the assets and liabilities of the successor entity be recorded at the date of the emergence at their respective fair values. Fair value is defined as the exchange price that would be received for an asset or paid to transfer a liability (an exit price) in the principal or most advantageous market for the asset or liability in an orderly transaction between market participants on the measurement date. Accordingly, we may be required to value assets at fair value measures that do not reflect our intended use of those assets. The fair value of in-process research and development, identifiable intangible assets and certain tangible assets requires the use of significant estimates and assumptions, including, but not limited to, estimating future cash flows and developing appropriate discount rates. Accordingly, for significant items, we typically obtain assistance from third party valuation specialists. Fair value measurements can be highly subjective and the reasonable application may result in a range of alternative estimates using the same facts and circumstances. Any excess of the enterprise value over the estimated fair values of the net assets is recorded as goodwill. As a result, we adjusted the carrying value of goodwill to $224\nwhich represents the reorganizational value of assets in excess of amounts allocated to identified tangible and intangible assets.\nRecently Issued Accounting Standards\nThe nature and impact of recent accounting pronouncements is discussed in Note 5 to our consolidated financial statements in this Form 10-K, which is incorporated herein by reference.\n50\nTable of Contents","62":"ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT\u0092S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL\nCONDITIONS AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nOverview\nThe Company is a specialty metals and alloys company focusing\non scandium and other specialty metals.\nThe Company was incorporated under the laws of the Province of\nBritish Columbia, Canada in 2006. The Company currently trades on the Toronto\nStock Exchange under the symbol \u0093SCY\u0094.\nThe Company\u0092s focus is on the exploration and evaluation of its\nspecialty metals assets, specifically the Nyngan scandium deposit located in New\nSouth Wales, Australia and the T\u00f8rdal scandium\/rare earth minerals deposit in\nNorway. In June 2014, the Company made the final installment payment to acquire\nthe Nyngan property. The Company is an exploration stage company and anticipates\nincurring significant additional expenditures prior to production at any and all\nof its properties.\n38\nIn fiscal 2015, the Company exchanged a $2,500,000 loan for a\n20% interest in its Australian subsidiary which holds the Nyngan Scandium\nProject and Honeybugle Scandium property. Accordingly, the Company holds an 80%\ninterest in its Australian subsidiary as at period end. The full $2,500,000 has\nbeen reflected in additional paid in capital.\nThese condensed consolidated financial statements have been\nprepared on a going concern basis that contemplates the realization of assets\nand discharge of liabilities at their carrying values in the normal course of\nbusiness for the foreseeable future. These financial statements do not reflect\nany adjustments that may be necessary if the Company is unable to continue as a\ngoing concern.\nThe Company currently earns no operating revenues and will\nrequire additional capital to advance both the Nyngan Scandium Project and the\nHoneybugle property. The Company\u0092s ability to continue as a going concern is\nuncertain and is dependent upon the generation of profits from mineral\nproperties, obtaining additional financing and maintaining continued support\nfrom its shareholders and creditors. These are material uncertainties that raise\nsubstantial doubt about the Company\u0092s ability to continue as a going concern. If\nadditional financial support is not received or operating profits are not\ngenerated, the carrying values of the Company\u0092s assets may be adversely\naffected.\nRESULTS FOR THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2016\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nAt December 31, 2016, we had working capital of $625,108\nincluding cash of $615,234 and current liabilities of $41,353 as compared to\nworking capital of $2,149,874 including cash of $2,249,676 at December 31, 2015.\nThe decrease in working capital is due to costs incurred in completing the\nNyngan Scandium Project definitive feasibility study and ongoing operating\ncosts.\nAt December 31, 2016, we had a total of 21,820,000 (2015 \u0096\n17,610,000) stock options exercisable between C$0.07 and C$0.20 (2015 \u0096 between\nC$0.07 and C$0.315) which has the potential upon exercise to generate a total of\nC$2,465,660 (2015 \u0096 C$2,033,050) in cash over the next four and a half years.\nThere is no assurance that these securities will be exercised.\nOur continued development is contingent upon our ability to\nraise sufficient financing both in the short and long term. There are no\nguarantees that additional sources of funding will be available to us; however,\nmanagement is committed to pursuing all possible sources of financing to execute\nour business plan.\nOur major capital requirement in the next 12 months relates to\nthe start of construction on the Nyngan Scandium Project.\nThe Company will need additional funding to develop the Nyngan\nproject into a mine in the first half of 2017, and will seek to raise additional\nequity financing at that time.\nResults of Operations\nQuarter ended December 31, 2016\nThe net loss for the quarter decreased by $965,539 to $198,183\nfrom a loss of $1,163,722 in the prior year, mainly as a result of a research\nand development refund received for the Nyngan project.

No warrants are outstanding at March 13, 2017.\nCritical Accounting Estimates\nThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with\ngenerally accepted accounting policies requires our management to make estimates\nand assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at\nthe date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and\nexpenses during the reporting period. These estimates are based on past\nexperience, industry trends and known commitments and events. By their nature,\nthese estimates are subject to measurement uncertainty and the effects on the\nfinancial statements of changes in such estimates in future periods could be\nsignificant. Actual results will likely differ from those estimates.\nStock-based compensation\nWe use the Black-Scholes option pricing model to calculate the\nfair value of stock options and compensatory warrants granted. This model is\nsubject to various assumptions. The assumptions we make will likely change from\ntime to time. At the time the fair value is determined, the methodology that we\nuse is based on historical information, as well as anticipated future events.\nThe assumptions with the greatest impact on fair value are those for estimated\nstock volatility and for the expected life of the instrument.\nDeferred income taxes\nWe account for tax consequences of the differences in the\ncarrying amounts of assets and liabilities and our tax bases using tax rates\nexpected to apply when these temporary differences are expected to be settled.\nWhen the deferred realization of income tax assets does not meet the test of\nbeing more likely than not to occur, a valuation allowance in the amount of the\npotential future benefit is taken and no future income tax asset is recognized.\nWe have taken a valuation allowance against all such potential tax assets.\nMineral properties and exploration and development costs\nWe capitalise the costs of acquiring mineral rights at the date\nof acquisition. After acquisition, various factors can affect the recoverability\nof the capitalized costs. Our recoverability evaluation of our mineral\nproperties and equipment is based on market conditions for minerals, underlying\nmineral resources associated with the assets and future costs that may be\nrequired for ultimate realization through mining operations or by sale. We are\nin an industry that is exposed to a number of risks and uncertainties, including\nexploration risk, development risk, commodity price risk, operating risk,\nownership and political risk, funding and currency risk, as well as\nenvironmental risk. Bearing these risks in mind, we have assumed recent world\ncommodity prices will be achievable. We have considered the mineral resource\nreports by independent engineers on the Nyngan project in considering the\nrecoverability of the carrying costs of the mineral properties. All of these\nassumptions are potentially subject to change, out of our control, however such\nchanges are not determinable. Accordingly, there is always the potential for a\nmaterial adjustment to the value assigned to mineral properties and equipment.\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\nAccounting Standards Update 2016-09 \u0096 Compensation\u0097Stock\nCompensation (Topic 718) Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment\nAccounting.

This discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the audited financial statements and the accompanying notes relating to the Trust and the Underlying Properties included in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report and\nThe Underlying Properties and the Royalty Interests\nand\nDiscussion and Analysis of Results from the Underlying Properties\nincluded in Part I, Item 1 of this Annual Report.\nOverview\nThe Trust is a statutory trust formed in June 2011 under the Delaware Statutory Trust Act. The business and affairs of the Trust are managed by the Trustee and, as necessary, the Delaware Trustee. The Trust does not conduct any operations or activities other than owning the Royalty Interests and activities related to such ownership. The Trust\u2019s purpose is generally to own the Royalty Interests, to distribute to the Trust unitholders cash that the Trust receives in\n39\nrespect of the Royalty Interests and the derivative contracts (described in Note 3 to the financial statements contained in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report) and to perform certain administrative functions in respect of the Royalty Interests and the Trust units. The Trust derives all or substantially all of its income and cash flow from the Royalty Interests and, through March 31, 2016, net gains on settlements of the derivative contracts. The Trust is treated as a partnership for federal income tax purposes.\nConcurrent with the Trust's initial public offering in November 2011, Chesapeake conveyed the Royalty Interests to the Trust effective July 1, 2011, which included interests in (a) 69 Producing Wells in the Colony Granite Wash play and (b) 118 Development Wells that have since been drilled in the Colony Granite Wash play on properties within the AMI. Chesapeake was obligated to drill, cause to be drilled or participate as a non-operator in the drilling of the Development Wells from drill sites in the AMI on or prior to June 30, 2016. Additionally, based on Chesapeake\u2019s assessment of the ability of a Development Well to produce in paying quantities, Chesapeake was obligated to either complete and tie into production or plug and abandon each Development Well. As of and June 30, 2016, Chesapeake had fulfilled its drilling obligation under the development agreement.\nThe Trust was not responsible for any costs related to the drilling of the Development Wells and is not responsible for any other operating or capital costs of the Underlying Properties, and Chesapeake was not permitted to drill and complete any well in the Colony Granite Wash formation on acreage included within the AMI for its own account until it satisfied its drilling obligation to the Trust.\nThe Royalty Interests entitle the Trust to receive 90% of the proceeds (after deducting certain post-production expenses and any applicable taxes) from the sales of production of oil, natural gas and NGL attributable to Chesapeake\u2019s net revenue interest in the Producing Wells and 50% of the proceeds (after deducting certain post-production expenses and any applicable taxes) from the sales of oil, natural gas and NGL production attributable to Chesapeake\u2019s net revenue interest in the Development Wells. Post-production expenses generally consist of costs incurred to gather, store, compress, transport, process, treat, dehydrate and market the oil, natural gas and NGL produced. However, the Trust is not responsible for costs of marketing services provided by Chesapeake or its affiliates.\nOn November 16, 2011, Chesapeake novated to the Trust, and the Trust became party to, derivative contracts covering a portion of the production attributable to the Royalty Interests from October 1, 2011 through September 30, 2015. The Trust\u2019s distributable income included net settlements under these derivative contracts. The fair value of the derivative contracts as of December 31, 2015 was a net asset of $2.1 million.\nThe Trust is required to make quarterly cash distributions of substantially all of its cash receipts, after deducting the Trust\u2019s administrative expenses, on or about 60 days following the completion of each calendar quarter through (and including) the quarter ending June 30, 2031. During the year ended\nDecember 31, 2016\n, four distributions were paid. See\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nbelow and Note 6 to the financial statements contained in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report for more information regarding the distributions.\nThe amount of Trust revenues and cash distributions to Trust unitholders fluctuates from quarter to quarter depending on several factors, including.\n\u2022\ntiming of initial production and sales from the Development Wells;\n\u2022\noil, natural gas and NGL prices received;\n\u2022\nvolumes of oil, natural gas and NGL produced and sold;\n\u2022\ncertain post-production expenses and any applicable taxes; and\n\u2022\nthe Trust\u2019s expenses.\n40\nResults of Trust Operations\nThe quarterly payments to the Trust with respect to the Royalty Interests are based on the amount of proceeds actually received by Chesapeake during the preceding calendar quarter. Proceeds from production are typically received by Chesapeake one month after production. Due to the timing of the payment of production proceeds, quarterly distributions made by Chesapeake to the Trust generally include royalties attributable to sales of oil, natural gas and NGL for three months, comprised of the first two months of the quarter just ended and the last month of the quarter prior to that one. Chesapeake is required to make the Royalty Interest payments to the Trust within 35 days of the end of each calendar quarter. During the year ended\nDecember 31, 2016\n, the Trust received payments on the Royalty Interests representing royalties attributable to proceeds from sales of oil, natural gas and NGL for\nSeptember 1, 2015\nthrough\nAugust 31, 2016\n. During the year ended\nDecember 31, 2015\n, the payments received by the Trust represented royalties attributable to proceeds from sales of oil, natural gas and NGL for September 1, 2014 through August 31, 2015. During the year ended December 31, 2014, the payments received by the Trust represented royalties attributable to proceeds from sales of oil, natural gas and NGL for September 1, 2013 through August 31, 2014.\nThe Trust\u2019s income available for distribution throughout 2015 and 2016 has been adversely affected by several factors. Oil and natural gas prices declined significantly in 2015 and 2016 and remain low through February 28, 2017. The Trust's revenues and distributable income available to unitholders have been and will continue to be adversely affected if commodity prices remain at current levels or decline further. For each of the quarterly production periods from September 1, 2015 to November 30, 2015, December 1, 2015 to February 29, 2016, March 1, 2016 to May 31, 2016, and June 1, 2016 to August 31, 2016, the Trust paid a common unit distribution below the applicable subordination threshold and no subordinated distribution was paid.\nLow levels of future production and depressed commodity prices will continue to reduce the Trust\u2019s revenues and distributable income available to unitholders and will likely result in continued distributions to common unitholders below the subordination threshold, which will no longer be applicable following the distribution for the second quarter of 2017. When a quarterly cash distribution in respect of the common units is lower than the applicable subordination threshold, the common units are not entitled to receive any additional distributions, nor are the common units or the subordinated units entitled to arrearages in any future quarter. Upon conversion of the subordinated units, it is anticipated that the quarterly cash distribution in respect of the common units will be lower due to the increased number of common units outstanding. In addition, if oil prices remain at current levels, we anticipate that there may be a further substantial decline in cash distributions resulting from lower realized oil prices, as oil production is no longer hedged. During the year ended December 31, 2016, approximately\n$2.1 million\n, or 17%, of the distributable income available to common unitholders was attributable to derivative settlement gains, or hedging activities.\nDuring the year ended\nDecember 31, 2016\n, the Trust recognized an aggregate of\n$22.6 million\nin impairments of the Royalty Interests primarily due to a decrease in commodity prices used to calculate the proved reserves attributable to the Trust's interest in the Underlying Properties. During the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, the Trust recognized approximately\n$154.2 million\nand\n$35.4 million\n, respectively, in impairments of the Royalty Interests primarily due to a decrease in commodity prices used to calculate the proved reserves attributable to the Trust's interest in the Underlying Properties and lower proved reserve quantities attributable to higher-than-expected pressure depletion within certain areas of the AMI. See Note 2 to the financial statements contained in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report for further discussion of the impairments.\nDistributable Income.\nThe Trust's distributable income was\n$12.5 million\nfor the year ended\nDecember 31, 2016\n, compared to\n$53.3 million\nfor the year ended\nDecember 31, 2015\n. The $40.8 million decrease from 2015 to 2016 was primarily due to a decrease in the average realized prices received from sales of oil, natural gas and NGL, a decrease in production volumes in the production period from\nSeptember 1, 2015\nto\nAugust 31, 2016\n(\"\n2016 production period\n\") as compared to the production period from September 1, 2014 to August 31, 2015 (\"\n2015 production period\n\") and a decrease in derivative settlement gains. Distributable income paid to the Trust unitholders during the year ended December 31, 2014 and attributable to production from September 1, 2013 to August 31, 2014 (\"\n2014 production period\n\") was\n$84.0 million\n. The $30.7 million decrease in the Trust's distributable income for the 2015 production period as compared to the 2014 production period was the result of a decrease in the average realized prices received from sales of oil, natural gas and NGL and a decrease in production volumes in the 2015 production period as compared to the 2014 production period. See\nRoyalty Income\nbelow for information regarding average prices received and sales volumes.\n41\nOn a per unit basis, cash distributions during the year ended\nDecember 31, 2016\nand attributable to the\n2016 production period\nwere\n$0.3561\nper common unit and no subordinated unit distributions were paid as compared to\n$1.5206\nper common unit and no subordinated unit distributions were paid for the year ended\nDecember 31, 2015\nand attributable to the\n2015 production period\n. Cash distributions were\n$2.3953\nper common unit and no subordinated unit distributions were paid for the year ended\nDecember 31, 2014\nand attributable to the\n2014 production period\n.

As a result, no distribution was paid for the subordinated units in each year.\nRoyalty Income.\nRoyalty income to the Trust for the year ended\nDecember 31, 2016\n, and attributable to the\n2016 production period\n, totaled\n$12.4 million\nbased upon sales of production attributable to the Royalty Interests of 172 mbbls of oil, 4,306 mmcf of natural gas and 370 mbbls of NGL. Total production attributable to the Royalty Interests for the\n2016 production period\nwas 1,260 mboe. Average prices received for oil, natural gas and NGL production, including the impact of certain post-production expenses and excluding production taxes, during the\n2016 production period\nwere $34.28 per bbl of oil, $0.22 per mcf of natural gas and $15.08 per bbl of NGL, respectively.\nRoyalty income to the Trust for the year ended\nDecember 31, 2015\n, and attributable to the\n2015 production period\n, totaled\n$36.4 million\nbased upon sales of production attributable to the Royalty Interests of 269 mbbls of oil,  6,447 mmcf of natural gas and 575 mbbls of NGL. Total production attributable to the Royalty Interests for the\n2015 production period\nwas 1,920 mboe. Average prices received for oil, natural gas and NGL production, including the impact of certain post-production expenses and excluding production taxes, during the\n2015 production period\nwere $55.74 per bbl of oil, $1.65 per mcf of natural gas and $18.60 per bbl of NGL, respectively.\nRoyalty income to the Trust for the year ended\nDecember 31, 2014\n, and attributable to the\n2014 production period\n, totaled\n$96.0 million\nbased upon sales of production attributable to the Royalty Interests of 415 mbbls of oil, 8,837 mmcf of natural gas and 930 mbbls of NGL. Total production attributable to the Royalty Interests for the\n2014 production period\nwas 2,817 mboe. Average prices received for oil, natural gas and NGL production, including the impact of certain post-production expenses and excluding production taxes, during the\n2014 production period\nwere $95.74 per bbl of oil, $2.83 per mcf of natural gas and $33.62 per bbl of NGL, respectively.\n42\nThe decrease in the price received per boe in the 2016 production period compared to the 2015 production period resulted in an $11.5 million decrease in royalty income. Decreased sales volumes resulted in a $12.5 million decrease in royalty income, for a net decrease in royalty income of $24.0 million.\nThe decrease in the price received per boe in the 2015 production period compared to the 2014 production period resulted in a $29.0 million decrease in royalty income. Decreased sales volumes resulted in a $30.6 million decrease in royalty income, for a net decrease in royalty income of $59.6 million.\nProduction Taxes\n.  Production taxes are calculated as a percentage of oil, natural gas and NGL revenues, net of any applicable tax credits. Production taxes for the year ended\nDecember 31, 2016\n, and attributable to the 2016 production period, totaled\n$0.4 million\n, or $0.36 per boe, or approximately 3.6% of royalty income, as compared to production taxes of\n$0.7 million\n, or $0.35 per boe, or approximately 1.9% of royalty income for the year ended December 31, 2015, and attributable to the 2015 production period, and $1.9 million, or $0.68 per boe, or approximately 2.0% of royalty income, for the year ended December 31, 2014, and attributable to the 2014 production period. The decrease in production taxes per boe from 2014 to 2015 was primarily due to a decrease in oil, natural gas and NGL prices.\nTrust Administrative Expenses.\nTrust administrative expenses, including additional cash reserves, for the year ended\nDecember 31, 2016\ntotaled\n$1.6 million\n. Trust administrative expenses, including cash reserves, for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014 totaled\n$1.5 million\nand $1.4 million, respectively. Trust administrative expenses primarily consist of the administrative fees paid to the Trustees and Chesapeake and costs for accounting and legal services.\nCash Settlements on Derivatives.\nThe Trust recorded gains or losses from the derivative contracts when proceeds were received or payments were made, respectively. Swaps covering the 2015 production period were settled, during the year ended\nDecember 31, 2016\n, and proceeds received were included in the Trust's distributable income for the 2016 production period. Total gains on settlements of the derivative contracts during the year ended\nDecember 31, 2016\nwere\n$2.1 million\n. During the year ended December 31, 2015, swaps covering the\n2015 production period\nwere settled and proceeds received from the swaps were included in the Trust's distributable income for the\n2015 production period\n. Total gains on settlements of the derivative contracts during the year ended\nDecember 31, 2015\nwere\n$19.1 million\n. During the year ended December 31, 2014, swaps covering the\n2014 production period\nwere settled with proceeds from royalty income for the\n2014 production period\n. Total losses during the year ended\nDecember 31, 2014\nwere\n$8.7 million.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nThe Trust\u2019s principal sources of liquidity and capital are cash flows generated from the Royalty Interests, the loan commitment as described below and, prior to the expiration of the derivative contracts on September 30, 2015, cash settlements on derivative contracts during periods in which oil prices fall below the fixed price received on derivative contracts. The Trust\u2019s primary uses of cash are distributions to Trust unitholders, including, if applicable, incentive distributions to Chesapeake, payments of production taxes, payments of Trust administrative expenses, including any reserves established by the Trustee for future liabilities and repayment of loans and payments of expense reimbursements to Chesapeake for out-of-pocket expenses incurred on behalf of the Trust. Administrative expenses include payments to the Trustee and the Delaware Trustee as well as a quarterly fee of $50,000 to Chesapeake pursuant to an administrative services agreement. Each quarter, the Trustee determines the amount of funds available for distribution. Available funds are the excess cash, if any, received by the Trust from the sales of oil, natural gas and NGL production attributable to the Royalty Interests during the quarter, over the Trust\u2019s expenses for the quarter and any cash reserve for the payment of liabilities of the Trust, subject in all cases to the subordination and incentive provisions described previously.\nThe Trust is required to make quarterly cash distributions of substantially all of its cash receipts, after deducting the Trust\u2019s administrative expenses, on or about 60 days following the completion of each calendar quarter through (and including) the quarter ending June 30, 2031. During the year ended\nDecember 31, 2016\n, four distributions were paid. The 2016 first quarter distribution of $0.2195 per common unit to common unitholders other than Chesapeake, consisting of proceeds attributable to production from September 1, 2015 through November 30, 2015, was made on\nMarch 1, 2016\nto record unitholders as of February 19, 2016. Chesapeake received $0.0369 per common unit and waived its right to receive the higher distribution on its units with respect to the 2016 first quarter distribution. The Trust's distributable income was $0.1567 per common unit. The 2016 second quarter distribution of\n$0.0403\nper common unit, consisting of proceeds attributable to production from December 1, 2015 through February 29, 2016, was made on\n43\nMay 31, 2016\nto record unitholders as of May 20, 2016. The 2016 third quarter distribution of\n$0.0734\nper common unit, consisting of proceeds attributable to production from March 1, 2016 through May 31, 2016, was made on\nAugust 29, 2016\nto record unitholders as of August 19, 2016. The 2016 fourth quarter distribution of\n$0.0857\nper common unit, consisting of proceeds attributable to production from June 1, 2016 through August 31, 2016, was made on\nDecember 1, 2016\nto record unitholders as of November 21, 2016. Because each of these distributions was below the applicable subordination threshold, no subordinated distributions were paid during the periods described above.\nThe following is a summary of distributable income, distributable income per common unit and distributable income per subordinated unit by quarter for the years ended\nDecember 31, 2016\n, 2015 and 2014 (in thousands except per unit amounts).\n2016\nQ1\nQ2\nQ3\nQ4\nTotal\nDistributable income\n$5,493\n$1,412\n$2,574\n$3,006\n$12,485\nDistributable income per common unit\n$0.1567\n$0.0403\n$0.0734\n$0.0857\n$0.3561\nDistributable income per subordinated unit\n$\u2014\n$\u2014\n$\u2014\n$\u2014\n$\u2014\n2015\nQ1\nQ2\nQ3\nQ4\nTotal\nDistributable income\n$15,763\n$13,673\n$12,548\n$11,331\n$53,315\nDistributable income per common unit\n$0.4496\n$0.3899\n$0.3579\n$0.3232\n$1.5206\nDistributable income per subordinated unit\n$\u2014\n$\u2014\n$\u2014\n$\u2014\n$\u2014\n2014\nQ1\nQ2\nQ3\nQ4\nTotal\nDistributable income\n$23,227\n$22,628\n$20,321\n$17,808\n$83,984\nDistributable income per common unit\n$0.6624\n$0.6454\n$0.5796\n$0.5079\n$2.3953\nDistributable income per subordinated unit\n$\u2014\n$\u2014\n$\u2014\n$\u2014\n$\u2014\nOn\nFebruary 6, 2017\n, the Trust announced that a cash distribution of $0.0912 per common unit consisting of proceeds attributable to production from September 1, 2016 to November 30, 2016, to common unitholders of record, as of\nFebruary 20, 2017\nwould be paid on March 2, 2017. The Trust's quarterly calculated income available for distribution was $0.0684 per unit, which was $0.3416 below the subordination threshold. See Note 7 to the financial statements contained in Item 8 of this Annual Report for additional information regarding the distribution paid on\nMarch 2, 2017\nto record unitholders as of\nFebruary 20, 2017.\nThe subordination period will end at the end of the 2017 second quarter, at which time the common units will no longer have the protection of the subordination threshold and the subordinated units will convert on a one-to-one basis into common units. After such time, the Trust unitholders will share on a pro rata basis in the Trust\u2019s distributions, and we expect the common units distribution will decrease due to the increased number of common units outstanding.\nThe Trustee can authorize the Trust to borrow money to pay Trust expenses that exceed cash held by the Trust. The Trustee may authorize the Trust to borrow from the Trustee as a lender provided the terms of the loan are fair to the Trust unitholders. The Trustee may also deposit funds awaiting distribution in an account with itself, if the interest paid to the Trust at least equals amounts paid by the Trustee on similar deposits, and make other short-term investments with the funds distributed to the Trust. The Trustee may also hold funds awaiting distribution in a non-interest bearing account.\nPursuant to the Trust Agreement, if at any time the Trust\u2019s cash on hand (including cash reserves) is not sufficient to pay the Trust\u2019s ordinary course expenses as they become due, Chesapeake will loan funds to the Trust necessary to pay such expenses. Any funds loaned by Chesapeake pursuant to this commitment will be limited to the payment of current accounts payable or other obligations to trade creditors in connection with obtaining goods or services or the payment of other current liabilities arising in the ordinary course of the Trust\u2019s business, and may not be used to satisfy Trust indebtedness for borrowed money of the Trust. If Chesapeake loans funds pursuant to this commitment, unless Chesapeake agrees otherwise, no further distributions will be made to unitholders (except in respect of any previously determined quarterly cash distribution amount) until such loan is repaid. As of December 31, 2016, there were no loans outstanding. As of December 31, 2015, a $175,000 loan was outstanding with Chesapeake, and the\n44\nloan was repaid in March 2016. Chesapeake agreed to permit the Trust to continue making distributions while the loan was outstanding.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nThe Trust has no off-balance sheet arrangements. The Trust has not guaranteed the debt of any other party, nor does the Trust have any other arrangements or relationships with other entities that could potentially result in unconsolidated debt, losses or contingent obligations.\nContractual Obligations\nAs of\nDecember 31, 2016\n, the Trust had no obligations or commitments to make future contractual payments other than the Trustee administrative fee, administrative services fee and the Delaware Trustee administrative fee payable to the Trustee, Chesapeake and the Delaware Trustee, respectively. The table below summarizes the Trust's contractual obligations as of December 31, 2016.\nTotal\nLess than 1 Year\n1-3 Years\n3-5 Years\nMore than 5 Years\n($ in thousands)\nContractual Obligations.\nTrustee administrative fee\n$2,538\n$175\n$350\n$350\n$1,663\nChesapeake administrative services fee\n2,900\n200\n400\n400\n1,900\nDelaware Trustee administrative fee\n29\n2\n4\n4\n19\nTotal contractual obligations\n$5,467\n$377\n$754\n$754\n$3,582\nThe Trust is obligated to make quarterly cash distributions of substantially all of its cash receipts, after deducting the Trust's expenses, approximately 60 days following the completion of each calendar quarter through, and including, the quarter ending June 30, 2031.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nBasis of Accounting\n.  Financial statements of the Trust differ from financial statements prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (GAAP) as the Trust records revenues when received and expenses when paid and may also establish certain cash reserves for contingencies that would not be accrued in financial statements prepared in accordance with GAAP. This non-GAAP, comprehensive basis of accounting corresponds to the accounting principles permitted for royalty trusts by the SEC as specified by Staff Accounting Bulletin Topic 12:E,\nFinancial Statements of Royalty Trusts.\nThe Trust's financial statements for all periods presented have been prepared by the Trust in accordance with the accounting policies noted below.\nInvestment in Royalty Interests\n.  The conveyance of the Royalty Interests to the Trust was accounted for as a transfer of properties between entities under common control and recorded at the historical cost of Chesapeake (\u201cInvestment in Royalty Interests\u201d), which was based on an allocation of the historical net book value of Chesapeake's full cost pool according to the fair value of the Royalty Interests relative to the fair value of Chesapeake's proved reserves. The carrying value of the Trust's Investment in Royalty Interests will not necessarily be indicative of the fair value of such Royalty Interests.\nThis investment is amortized as a single cost center on a units-of-production basis over total proved reserves. Such amortization does not reduce distributable income, rather it is charged directly to Trust corpus. Revisions to estimated future units-of-production are treated on a prospective basis beginning on the date significant revisions are known.\nOn a quarterly basis, the Trust evaluates the carrying value of the Investment in Royalty Interests under the full cost accounting method prescribed by the SEC. This quarterly review is referred to as a ceiling test. Under the ceiling test, the carrying value of the Investment in Royalty Interests may not exceed an amount equal to the PV-10 for the Trust's proved reserves. Any write-downs resulting from the ceiling test will be non-cash charges to Trust corpus and will not affect distributable income.\n45\nUse of Estimates.\nThe preparation of financial statements requires the Trust to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities and Trust corpus during the reporting period. Significant estimates that impact the Trust's financial statements include estimates of proved oil, natural gas and NGL reserves, which are used to compute the Trust's amortization of Investment in Royalty Interests and, as necessary, to evaluate potential impairment of Investment in Royalty Interests and determine the fair value of outstanding derivatives. Actual results could differ from those estimates.\nDerivatives.\nTo mitigate a portion of the exposure to adverse market changes of oil prices, the Trust had derivative contracts covering a portion of oil production through September 30, 2015. See Note 3 to the financial statements contained in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report for further discussion of the derivative contracts.\nThe Trust recorded gains or losses from the derivative contracts when proceeds were received or payments were made, respectively. Additionally, changes in the fair value of the derivative contracts were accounted for as an adjustment to Trust corpus and the fair value carried on the Statements of Assets, Liabilities and Trust Corpus. Cash distributions to unitholders were increased or decreased by settlements of the Trust's derivative contracts. The Trust continued to settle derivative contracts through February 2016.\nRevenues and Expenses.\nRevenues received by the Trust are net of existing royalties and overriding royalties associated with Chesapeake's interests and are reduced by certain post-production expenses, production taxes and other allowable expenses, such as the Trust's administrative expenses, in order to determine distributable income. The Royalty Interests are not burdened by field and lease operating expenses.","65":"","66":"","67":"ITEM 7.\nMANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION\nAND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nThis Management Discussion and Analysis should be read in conjunction with the accompanying consolidated financial statements and related notes contained elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nThis Management Discussion and Analysis contains forward\u2010looking statements that involve risks, uncertainties, and assumptions as described under the heading \"Cautionary Note Regarding Forward\u2010Looking Statements,\" in Part I of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Our actual results could differ materially from those anticipated by these forward\u2010looking statements as a result of many factors, including those discussed under \"Item 1A. Risk Factors\" and elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nOverview\nWe are the only producer of potash in the United States and are one of two producers of langbeinite, which we market and sell as Trio\n\u00ae\n. Our revenues are generated exclusively from the sale of potash and Trio\n\u00ae\n. We also produce salt, magnesium chloride and brine from our potash and langbeinite mining processes, the sales of which are accounted for as by-product credits to our cost of sales. These by-product credits represented approximately 2% to 5% of total cost of goods sold in each of the last three years.\nWe produce potash at three solar evaporation solution mining facilities and, until the second quarter of 2016, we also produced potash from two conventional mining facilities. Our solution mining production comes from our HB solar solution mine in Carlsbad, New Mexico, a solution mine in Moab, Utah, and a brine recovery mine in Wendover, Utah. Our conventional production came from our underground West and East mines in Carlsbad, New Mexico. We also operate the North compaction facility in Carlsbad, New Mexico, which services the HB mine. We produce Trio\n\u00ae\nfrom our conventional underground East mine. In April 2016, we converted our East facility from a mixed-ore facility that produced both potash and Trio\n\u00ae\nto a Trio\n\u00ae\n-only facility. We no longer produce potash from our conventional underground East mine.\nIn early July 2016, we idled mining operations at our West facility and transitioned it into a care-and-maintenance mode due to the decline in potash prices. Accordingly, beginning in July 2016, all of our potash is produced from our three solution mining facilities.\nSignificant Business Trends and Activities\nOur financial results have been impacted by several significant trends, which are described below. We expect that these trends will continue to impact our results of operations, cash flows, and financial position.\n\u2022\nPotash prices and demand.\nPotash prices are a significant driver of profitability for our business. Our average net realized sales price per ton for potash decreased to $195 per ton in the year ended December 31, 2016, from $339 per ton in the year ended December 31, 2015. Potash prices declined for the first nine months of 2016, before increasing slightly in the fourth quarter of 2016 in advance of the 2017 spring application season. The significant price decline that began in the second half of 2015 and continued through the third quarter of 2016 was primarily due to oversupply and the impact of a strong U.S. dollar on global producers importing tonnage into the North American potash market. Although production curtailments from us and other producers in 2015 and 2016 reduced potash supply in North America, global capacity is expected to continue to exceed demand. Domestic pricing of our potash is influenced principally by the price established by our competitors. The interaction of global potash supply and demand, credit, ocean, land and barge freight rates, and currency fluctuations also influence pricing. We expect potash prices will remain firm through the first half of 2017.\nWe sold\n681,000\ntons of potash in the year ended December 31, 2016, an increase of 94,000 tons compared to potash sales volumes in the year ended December 31, 2015. This increase resulted primarily from soft demand during the second half of 2015 compared to more normal demand in 2016. In addition, after experiencing weaker demand in our industrial markets over the last couple of years due to less oil and gas drilling activity in the U.S., starting in mid-2016 drilling activity has increased in geographies near our mining locations as oil prices have begun to recover.\nOur ability to supply tons to our customers on a timely basis continues to be a fundamental element of our sales strategy. We utilize our geographic location, which is an advantage relative to other producers, as well as our strong distribution system, to effectively position product closer to our customers.\nThe specific timing of when farmers apply potash remains highly weather dependent and varies across the numerous growing regions within the U.S. The timing of potash sales is significantly influenced by the marketing programs of potash producers, as well as storage volumes closer to the farm gate. The combination of these items results in variability in potash sales and shipments, thereby increasing volatility of sales volumes from quarter to quarter and season to season.\n35\nTable of Contents\nOur potash production volume, and therefore our potash sales volumes, will be less in 2017 as compared to 2016 due to the transition of our East facility to Trio\n\u00ae\n-only in April 2016 and the transition of our West facility into care-and-maintenance mode in July 2016.\n\u2022\nTrio\n\u00ae\nprices and demand.\nWe sold\n146,000\ntons of Trio\n\u00ae\nin the year ended December 31, 2016, a decrease of 17,000 tons compared to Trio\n\u00ae\nsales volumes in the year ended December 31, 2015. Trio\n\u00ae\ndemand was negatively impacted by the overall softness in the fertilizer market for the same reasons discussed above with respect to potash demand. Further, some of our domestic Trio\n\u00ae\ncustomers delayed purchases and moved to more of a just-in-time purchasing model as these customers gained increased confidence in our ability to supply the product closer to the domestic traditional spring application season.\nOur average net realized sales price per ton for Trio\n\u00ae\nwas $287 per ton in the year ended December 31, 2016, as compared to $364 per ton in the year ended December, 31 2015. Although we experienced price decreases for Trio\n\u00ae\ninto the fourth quarter of 2016, domestic Trio\n\u00ae\npricing stabilized in the fourth quarter and into the first part of 2017.\nOver the long term, we believe the demand for Trio\n\u00ae\nwill exceed supply, providing an opportunity to increase our gross margin. In light of this opportunity, in mid-2016, we transitioned our East facility to a Trio\n\u00ae\n-only facility, which significantly increased our production rate and our effective production capacity for Trio\n\u00ae\n. We will continue our efforts to expand our sales and marketing efforts for Trio\n\u00ae\n, particularly internationally. However, we have experienced a longer-than-expected ramp-up for international sales and in some international locations our Trio\n\u00ae\naverage net realized sales prices are significantly lower than domestic pricing. As a result, we may incur lower-of-cost-or-market adjustments for Trio\n\u00ae\ntons that are positioned for sale into these markets. We operate our East facility at production levels that approximate demand and expect to continue to do so for the foreseeable future.\n\u2022\nDecrease in Production\n. Due to decreased potash prices, in July 2016 we idled mining operations at our West facility and transitioned it to care-and-maintenance mode. In addition, in April 2016, we transitioned our East facility from a mixed-ore processing facility that processed both potash and Trio\n\u00ae\nto a Trio\n\u00ae\n-only facility. As discussed above, due to the longer-than-expected ramp-up for international Trio\n\u00ae\nsales in the fourth quarter of 2016, we began operating our East facility at production levels that approximate demand and expect to continue to do so for the foreseeable future. As a result of these activities, we incurred restructuring charges of approximately\n$2.7 million\nin the year ended December 31, 2016, primarily related to severance payments made to impacted employees.\n\u2022\nEvaluation of strategic alternatives\n. Under the terms of our senior notes, in December 2016 we engaged Cantor Fitzgerald & Co., a nationally-recognized investment bank, to assess, evaluate, and assist in pursuing potential strategic alternatives available to us, as we determine to be appropriate. These potential strategic alternatives could include, but are not limited to, continuing our current operating plan, equity offerings or balance sheet restructurings, merger and acquisition opportunities, partnership or joint venture opportunities, entering into new or complementary businesses, or a sale of Intrepid or some or all of our assets. This evaluation is ongoing.\n\u2022\nWeather impact.\nEvaporation rates at our potash solution mines during the 2015 evaporation season were below average, resulting in lower production levels in 2016. During the 2016 evaporation season, we experienced average to above-average evaporation rates. As a result, we expect our potash production to increase in 2017 compared to 2016.\n\u2022\nRevised Debt Terms.\nIn October 2016, we entered into an amended agreement governing our senior notes. As a result, we expensed\n$3.1 million\nof debt restructuring costs paid to third parties. Under the revised terms of the agreement our interest rates increased by 4.5% above the stated rates under the terms of the original agreement.

Our total cost of goods sold decreased in 2016 as compared to 2015 primarily from less depreciation on our assets in 2016 due to the impairment of long-lived assets in 2015, and from selling fewer potash tons from our East facility, previously our highest cost facility, which transitioned to Trio\n\u00ae\n-only production in the second quarter of 2016. During the years ended December 31, 2016, and 2015,\n98%\nand\n97%\nof our total sales were in the United States, with the remaining sales primarily into Canada, Asia, and Latin America.\nIn total, our cost of goods sold decreased\n$46.9 million\n, or\n22%\n, from\n$217.8 million\nin\n2015\nto\n$170.9 million\nin\n2016\n. Due to the idling of our West facility, and the transition of our East facility to a Trio\n\u00ae\n-only facility, we sold fewer tons of potash from these facilities, which previously represented our highest cost facilities. Further, due to the impairment of long\u2010lived assets recorded in the fourth quarter of 2015, we recorded less depreciation expense in\n2016\n. As a percentage of sales, cost of goods sold increased during\n2016\nas our net average sales price for both potash and Trio\n\u00ae\ndecreased over 2015 levels.\nNet loss for\n2016\nwas\n$66.6 million\n, compared to a net loss for 2015 of $524.8 million, which primarily related to long-lived asset impairment charges of\n$323.8 million\nand an increase in our valuation allowance of\n$300.3 million\non our deferred tax assets.\nSelling and Administrative Expense\nSelling and administrative expenses decreased to\n$20.0 million\nin\n2016\ncompared to\n$27.5 million\nin\n2015\nas a result of lower administrative headcount, aircraft-related costs, corporate facility rent expense and professional fees.\nDebt Restructuring Expense\nIn the fourth quarter of 2016, after we completed our debt restructuring, we expensed\n$3.1 million\nof professional fees paid to third parties.\n37\nTable of Contents\nRestructuring Expense\nIn January 2016, we undertook a number of cost-saving actions in response to continued downward pressure on potash prices. These actions included the elimination of a portion of our workforce and reductions in compensation and benefits (including elimination of annual bonuses for 2015 and 2016 for most employees). Additionally, in connection with the transition of our East facility to Trio\n\u00ae\n-only production in April 2016, the transition of our West facility to care-and-maintenance mode in July 2016, and the implementation of a reduced operating schedule at our East facility in December 2016, our overall headcount was approximately 48% less as of December 31, 2016, as compared to December 31, 2015. In connection with these events, we recorded restructuring expenses of approximately\n$2.7 million\n, primarily for severance related activities, the majority of which was paid in 2016.\nImpairment of Long-Lived Assets\nDuring 2015, in connection with our periodic evaluation of the recoverability of our assets, due to the significant decrease in potash prices during the second half of 2015, we recognized an impairment charge of $323.8 million related to our East and West conventional mining facilities, and our North facility in New Mexico due to the continued decline in potash prices noted during this period.\nOther Operating (Income) Expense\nIn December 2015, a snowstorm caused damage to a portion of one of our warehouses in New Mexico and product stored in the warehouse. These damages, as well as alternative handling and storage costs were covered by our insurance policies at replacement value, less a $1 million deductible. During the fourth quarter of 2015, we recognized $2.5 million of losses related to this snowstorm, and those losses are reflected in \"Other operating (income) expense\" in the accompanying consolidated statement of operations. In the second quarter of 2016, we received $1.2 million in insurance proceeds related to this event, and recognized that amount in \"Other operating (income) expense\" at that time.\nIn late 2014, we initiated legal action to protest property tax valuations in New Mexico. In the second quarter of 2015, we reached an agreement with the State of New Mexico that resulted in a net $2.0 million reduction in previously paid property taxes. Accordingly, as the inventory produced during 2014 has since been sold, we recorded the settlement in \"Other operating (income) expense\" during the second quarter of 2015.\nInterest Expense\nInterest expense increased to $11.6 million in 2016, as compared to $6.4 million in 2015. This increase was the result of the higher interest rates on our senior notes as discussed further below, acceleration of the maturity date of our previous unsecured revolving credit facility during 2016 which necessitated the expensing of deferred financing costs related to that facility and the expensing of a modified make-whole payment related to the $15 million principal payment on our senior notes.\nConsolidated Results for the Years Ended December 31, 2015, and 2014\nTotal sales in 2015 decreased as compared to 2014 due to lower sales volumes for potash and Trio\n\u00ae\n. Our total cost of goods sold decreased in 2015 as compared to 2014 primarily due to lower sales volumes of both potash and Trio\n\u00ae\n. In total, our cost of goods sold decreased $86.1 million or 28%, from\n$303.9 million\nin 2014 to\n$217.8 million\nin\n2015\n, primarily as a result of fewer tons of potash sold in 2015 than in 2014. During both of the years ended December 31, 2015, and 2014, approximately\n97%\nour total sales were in the United States, with the remaining sales primarily into Canada, Asia, and Latin America.\nOur net loss for 2015 was $524.8 million, as compared to net income for 2014 of\n$9.8 million\n. Our net loss for 2015 included long-lived asset impairment charges of\n$323.8 million\nin the fourth quarter of 2015 and an increase in our valuation allowance of\n$300.3 million\non our deferred tax assets.\nSelling and Administrative Expense\nSelling and administrative expenses were essentially flat in the year ended December 31, 2015 as compared to 2014.\nRestructuring Expense\nIn January 2014, in response to lower potash prices and the substantial completion of our major capital projects, we undertook a number of cost saving actions that were intended to better align our cost structure with the current business environment. These initiatives included the elimination of approximately 7% of the workforce, including employees supporting our major capital projects, reduction in the use of outside professionals, and cutbacks in other general and administrative areas.\nOther Operating (Income) Expense\nIn December 2015, a snowstorm caused damage to a portion of one of our warehouses in New Mexico and product stored in the warehouse. These damages, as well as alternative handling and storage costs were covered by our insurance\n38\nTable of Contents\npolicies at replacement value, less a $1 million deductible. We submitted an insurance claim of $2.2 million. During the fourth quarter of 2015, we recognized $2.5 million of losses related to this snowstorm, and those losses are reflected in \"Other operating (income) expense\" in the accompanying consolidated statement of operations. In the second quarter of 2016, after considering our deductible, we received $1.2 million in insurance proceeds related to this event, and recognized that amount in \"Other operating (income) expense\" at that time.\nIn late 2014, we initiated legal action to protest property tax valuations in New Mexico. In the second quarter of 2015, we reached an agreement with the State of New Mexico that resulted in a net $2.0 million reduction in previously paid property taxes. Accordingly, as the inventory produced during 2014 has since been sold, we recorded the settlement in \"Other operating (income) expense\" during the second quarter of 2015.\nDuring 2013, our application for certain New Mexico employment-related credits was denied, and we recorded an additional allowance of $2.8 million related to the denied tax credits. In 2014, we received notice that the State of New Mexico had approved claims that had been previously denied. Accordingly, we reduced our estimate of the allowance related to the realizability of our claims by $4.1 million. The credits were for periods prior to 2014 and the inventory produced during that time has been sold; therefore, we recorded the decrease in the allowance as \"Other operating (income) expense\" in the accompanying consolidated statement of operations in 2014.\nPotash Segment Results\nYear Ended December 31,\n(in thousands)\n2016\n2015\n2014\nSales\n$159,494\n$217,467\n$334,323\nLess: Freight costs\n26,661\n18,262\n30,615\nWarehousing and handling costs\n8,439\n11,213\n10,742\nCost of goods sold\n4\n134,017\n172,355\n254,753\nLower-of-cost-or-market inventory adjustments\n18,380\n31,772\n8,186\nCosts associated with abnormal production and other\n649\n10,405\n\u2014\nGross (Deficit) Margin\n$(28,652\n)\n$(26,540\n)\n$30,027\nDepreciation, depletion and amortization incurred\n2, 3\n$37,936\n$68,562\n$67,712\nSales Volumes (tons in thousands)\n681\n587\n915\nProduction Volumes (tons in thousands)\n493\n768\n859\nAverage Net Realized Sales Price per Ton\n1\n$195\n$339\n$332\n1\nAverage net realized sales price per ton is a non-GAAP measure that we calculate as sales less freight costs then divided by sales tons.

In late 2015, there was significant uncertainty surrounding declining potash prices resulting from global and domestic potash supplies exceeding demand. As a result, customers limited their exposure to inventory price risk and deferred purchases. In 2016, we saw increased purchases based on farmer demand; however, customers have moved to more of a just-in-time purchasing model.\nSales of potash decreased by\n$58.0 million\n, or\n27%\n, to\n$159.5 million\nfor the year ended\nDecember 31, 2016\n, from\n$217.5 million\nfor the year ended\nDecember 31, 2015\n. This decrease was primarily the result of a\n42%\ndecrease in average net realized sales price per ton for potash partially offset by a\n16%\nincrease in sales volume.\nOur potash freight costs increased to\n$26.7 million\nin 2016 from\n$18.3 million\nin 2015 as we sold more tons in 2016 than in 2015. Our freight costs are impacted by the proportion of customers paying for their own freight, the geographic distribution of our products and the freight rates of our carriers.\n39\nTable of Contents\nTotal cost of goods sold of potash, which includes royalties and depreciation, depletion and amortization, decreased in 2016 compared to 2015 as we recorded less depreciation in 2016 due to the impairment of long-lived assets recorded in the fourth quarter of 2015. Further, our potash cost of goods sold also benefited from the direct expensing of lower-of-cost-or-market adjustments and abnormal production costs related to reduced production at our East facility. We recorded lower-of-cost-or-market inventory adjustments, and costs associated with abnormal production and other costs, during 2016 of\n$18.4 million\nand\n$0.6 million\nrespectively, which are excluded from our cost of goods sold.\nOur production volume of potash in\n2016\ndecreased to\n493,000\ntons, compared with\n768,000\ntons produced in\n2015\n. Our potash production was lower as we stopped producing potash at our East facility in April 2016 and idled potash production at our West facility in July 2016.\nWe routinely evaluate our production levels and costs to determine if any costs are associated with abnormal production, as described under generally accepted accounting principles. The assessment of normal production levels is judgmental and unique to each period. During 2015, we received an order issued by MSHA related to maintenance issues and salt build-up in the ore hoisting shaft at our West mine. Upon issuance of the order, we suspended production at the West mine for 15 days while we took corrective actions to resolve the issues. As a result, potash production from our West mine was abnormally low during this period. Further, during 2015 and in the first quarter of 2016, we temporarily suspended potash production periodically at our East facility as we performed testing related to developing our plans to convert the East facility to a Trio\n\u00ae\n-only facility in April 2016. As a result of these temporary suspensions of production, during 2015, we determined that approximately\n$10.4 million\nof costs would have been allocated to additional potash tons produced, assuming we had been operating at normal production rates. Accordingly, these costs were excluded from our inventory values and instead directly expensed in 2015 as production costs. As a result of the same analysis,\n$0.6 million\nof abnormal production costs were determined to have been incurred in 2016.\nPotash Segment Results for the Years Ended December 31, 2015, and 2014\nOur sales volumes in 2015 decreased by 36% as compared to 2014 primarily due to lower demand and the decreased purchasing of potash as the North American supply of potash pressured sales prices, particularly in the second half of 2015. Our potash average net realized sales price per ton remained relatively flat in 2015 and 2014.\nSales of potash decreased\n$116.9 million\n, or 35%, to\n$217.5 million\nfor the year ended December 31, 2015, from\n$334.3 million\nfor the year ended December 31, 2014. This decrease was the result of a 36% decrease in sales volumes of potash, as our customers lacked confidence in potash pricing in the second half of 2015 as mentioned above.\nOur potash freight costs decreased to\n$18.3 million\nin 2015 from\n$30.6 million\nin 2014 as we sold 36% fewer tons in 2015 than in 2014. Our freight costs are impacted by the proportion of customers paying for their own freight, the geographic distribution of our products and the freight rates of our carriers.\nTotal cost of goods sold of potash, which includes royalties and depreciation, depletion and amortization, decreased as we sold fewer tons in 2015 than in 2014. In addition, our lower-of-cost-or-market inventory adjustments during 2015 were\n$31.8 million\n, which are excluded from cost of goods sold. Further, as noted above, during 2015, we incurred\n$10.4 million\nof abnormal production costs, which were directly expensed rather than absorbed into inventory costs.\nOur potash production volume in 2015 was\n768,000\ntons as compared to 859,000 tons in 2014. The production decrease was due to reduced production at our West facility due to the temporary suspensions of production noted above, as well as lower production at our solar solution facilities due to less favorable evaporative conditions in 2014. These decreases were partially offset by increased production from our HB mine as it continued to ramp up production.\nPotash Segment - Additional Information\nThe table below shows our potash sales mix for\n2016\n,\n2015\n, and 2014.\nYear Ended December 31,\n2016\n2015\n2014\nAgricultural\n89%\n75%\n76%\nIndustrial\n5%\n17%\n19%\nFeed\n6%\n8%\n5%\nOur industrial sales are significantly influenced by oil and gas drilling activity. We believe our sales volumes to our industrial customers will increase in 2017, and potentially benefit our net realized sales price, as oil and gas drilling activity has increased in areas near our production facilities.\n40\nTable of Contents\nOur average net realized sales price per ton of potash steadily declined from the beginning of 2015 until the fourth quarter of 2016 due to concerns that global productive capacity exceeds demand. We saw a slight increase in the price in the fourth quarter of 2016 due in part to curtailments by potash producers, including us, that have resulted in lower potash supply.\nTrio\n\u00ae\nSegment Results\nYear Ended December 31,\n(in thousands)\n2016\n2015\n2014\nSales\n$51,454\n$69,716\n$76,066\nLess: Freight costs\n9,595\n10,461\n12,608\nWarehousing and handling costs\n2,567\n2,726\n2,320\nCost of goods sold\n36,835\n45,466\n49,161\nLower-of-cost-or-market inventory adjustments\n1,994\n\u2014\n\u2014\nCosts associated with abnormal production and other\n1,058\n\u2014\n\u2014\nGross (Deficit) Margin\n$(595\n)\n$11,063\n$11,977\nDepreciation, depletion and amortization incurred\n2, 3\n$3,836\n$16,993\n$11,433\nSales Volumes (tons in thousands)\n146\n163\n182\nProduction Volumes (tons in thousands)\n279\n162\n160\nAverage Net Realized Sales Price per Ton\n1\n$287\n$364\n$349\n1\nAverage net realized sales price per ton is a non-GAAP measure that we calculate as sales less freight costs then divided by sales tons.

Further, our Trio\n\u00ae\ncost of goods sold decreased in 2016 as compared to 2015 as depreciation and depletion expense for Trio\n\u00ae\nwas lower than in 2015 resulting from the impairment of long-lived assets at our East facility recorded in the fourth quarter of 2015. We also incurred lower production costs attributable to the conversion of our East facility to a Trio\n\u00ae\n-only facility in April 2016.\nOur Trio\n\u00ae\nproduction increased 72% in\n2016\ncompared to\n2015\n, as we transitioned our East facility to Trio\n\u00ae\n-only in April 2016.\nIn 2016, we recorded\n$2.0 million\nof lower-of-cost-or-market adjustments related to the decreases in Trio\n\u00ae\npricing as compared to our carrying cost of Trio\n\u00ae\ninventory.\nFurther, in 2016, we recorded\n$1.1 million\nof abnormal production costs for the period which we transitioned our East facility from a mixed-ore processing facility that produced potash and Trio\n\u00ae\nto Trio\n\u00ae\n-only production in April 2016.\nTrio\n\u00ae\nSegment Results for the Years Ended December 31, 2015, and 2014\nTotal sales of Trio\n\u00ae\ndecreased to\n$69.7 million\nfor the year ended December 31, 2015, from\n$76.1 million\nfor the year ended December 31, 2014, due to a 10% decrease in the volume of sales partially offset by a 4% increase in the average net realized sales price per ton of Trio\n\u00ae.\nTotal cost of goods sold of Trio\n\u00ae\ndecreased as our sales volumes in 2015 were 10% lower than in 2014.\n41\nTable of Contents\nTrio\n\u00ae\nSegment - Additional Information\nAs a result of our increased production levels of Trio, we are expanding our marketing efforts outside the United States. Our export sales of Trio\n\u00ae\ntend to have more variability as to the timing of these sales particularly as it relates to our quarterly results. During 2016, approximately\n6%\nof our total Trio\n\u00ae\nsales were sold internationally as shown in the table below.\nTrio\n\u00ae\nonly\nUnited States\nExport\nFor the year ended December 31, 2016\n94%\n6%\nFor the year ended December 31, 2015\n91%\n9%\nFor the year ended December 31, 2014\n91%\n9%\nSpecific Factors Affecting Our Results\nSales\nOur gross sales are derived from the sales of potash and Trio\n\u00ae\nand are determined by the quantities of product we sell and the sales prices we realize. We quote prices to customers both on a delivered basis and on the basis of pick-up at our plants and warehouses. Freight costs are incurred on only a portion of our sales as many of our customers arrange and pay for their own freight directly. When we arrange and pay for freight, our quotes and billings are based on expected freight costs to the points of delivery. When we calculate our average net realized sales price per ton, we deduct freight costs from gross sales before dividing by the number of tons sold. We believe the deduction of freight costs provides a more representative measure of our performance in the market due to variations caused by ongoing changes in the proportion of customers paying for their own freight, the geographic distribution of our products, and freight rates. Rail freight rates have been steadily increasing, thereby negatively influencing our average net realized sales price per ton. We manage our sales and marketing operations centrally and we work to achieve the highest average net realized sales price per ton we can by evaluating the product needs of our customers and associated logistics and then determining which of our production facilities can best satisfy these needs.\nThe volume of product we sell is determined by demand for our products and by our production capabilities. We operate our facilities at production levels that approximate demand and expect to continue to do so for the foreseeable future.\nCost of Goods Sold\nOur cost of goods sold reflects the costs to produce our potash and Trio\n\u00ae\nproducts, less credits generated from the sale of our by-products. Many of our production costs are largely fixed and, consequently, our costs of sales per ton on a facility-by-facility basis tend to move inversely with the number of tons we produce, within the context of normal production levels. Historically we experienced variability in our cost of goods sold due to fluctuations in the relative mix of product that we produce through conventional and solar solution mining. Our cost of goods sold per ton for our solar solution facilities is less than our cost of goods sold per ton for our conventional facilities. Since July 2016, all of our potash production comes from solar solution mining. However, our solar solution production is impacted by weather variability. Our principal production costs include labor and employee benefits, maintenance materials, contract labor, and materials for operating or maintenance projects, natural gas, electricity, operating supplies, chemicals, depreciation and depletion, royalties, and leasing costs. There are elements of our cost structure associated with contract labor, consumable operating supplies, reagents, and royalties that are variable, which make up a smaller component of our cost base. Our periodic production costs and costs of goods sold will not necessarily match one another from period-to-period based on the fluctuation of inventory, sales, and production levels at our facilities.\nOur production costs per ton are also impacted when our production levels change, due to factors such as changes in the grade of ore delivered to the plant, levels of mine development, plant operating performance, downtime, and annual maintenance turnarounds. We expect that our labor and contract labor costs in Carlsbad, New Mexico, will continue to be influenced most directly by the demand for labor in the local Carlsbad, New Mexico, region where we compete for labor with another fertilizer company, companies in the oil and gas industry, and a nuclear waste processing and storage facility. Prior to converting our East facility to a Trio\n\u00ae\n-only facility, we mined in a complex, mixed ore body comprised of both sylvite and langbeinite. This complex ore was processed through a singular product flow at the surface facility. As a result of this complex ore body and the related complexities of processing the mixed ore at the surface, our cost structure at our East facility was our highest cost facility. Subsequent to the transition to mining in langbeinite areas and the conversion of our East facility to Trio\n\u00ae\n\u2010only, our cost structure was reduced as the process flow was simplified.\nWe pay royalties to federal, state, and private lessors under our mineral leases. These payments typically equal a percentage of sales (less freight) of minerals extracted and sold under the applicable lease. In some cases, federal royalties for\n42\nTable of Contents\npotash are paid on a sliding scale that varies with the grade of ore extracted. Our average royalty rate was 4.2%, 4.1%, and 3.8% in\n2016\n,\n2015\nand\n2014\n, respectively.\nIncome Taxes\nWe are a subchapter C corporation and, therefore, are subject to federal and state income taxes on our taxable income. Our effective tax rate for the years ended December 31,\n2016\n,\n2015\n, and\n2014\nwas\n2.0%\n,\n(40.0)%\n, and\n9.7%\n, respectively. Our effective income tax rates are impacted primarily by changes in the underlying tax rates in jurisdictions in which we are subject to income tax and permanent differences between book and tax income for the period, including the benefit associated with the estimated effect of the depletion deduction and research and development credits. During the year ended December 31, 2016, our effective tax rate was impacted by the recording of an addition to our valuation allowance of\n$25.5 million\nrelating to deferred tax assets, including\n$34.6 million\nfor federal and state net operating losses offset by reductions in the valuation allowance relating to deferred tax assets, including\n$6.7 million\nfor property, plant, equipment and mineral properties, and\n$5.6 million\nfor inventory. We also recorded a receivable of\n$1.4 million\nrelated to the monetization of a portion of our alternative minimum tax carryforwards based on an election made available to taxpayers for 2016. During the year ended December 31, 2015, our effective tax rate was impacted as a result of recording an additional valuation allowance of\n$300.3 million\nrelated to existing deferred tax assets, including\n$218.8 million\nfor property, plant, equipment and mineral properties,\n$39.3 million\nfor federal and state net operating losses, and\n$4.2 million\nfor federal and state alternative minimum tax credits. The additional valuation allowance was recorded due to the uncertainty around our ability to generate sufficient taxable income to realize the deferred tax assets.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2014, our effective tax rate benefited from a discrete adjustment for the reversal of a $1.7 million valuation allowance related to our New Mexico net operating loss carry forwards based on legislation passed by the State of New Mexico during the first quarter of 2014. Further, we benefited from a discrete adjustment related to the calculation of the benefit of the net operating loss carry back generated in 2013. The impact on our effective tax rate during 2014 of these discrete adjustments is more pronounced given the current level of income before income taxes.\nOur federal and state income tax returns are subject to examination by federal and state tax authorities.\nDuring the year ended December 31,\n2016\n, we recognized a tax benefit of\n$1.4 million\n. During the years ended December 31,\n2015\n, and\n2014\n, we recognized income tax expense of\n$150.0 million\n, and\n$1.1 million\n, respectively. In 2016, 2015, and 2014, we incurred net operating losses for income tax purposes, which have been carried forward as a deferred tax asset.\nTotal tax (benefit) expense for the year ended December 31,\n2016\n, was comprised of\n$1.4 million\nof current income tax benefit and no deferred income tax expense. Total tax expense for the year ended December 31,\n2015\n, was comprised of $0.1 million of current income tax benefit and\n$150.1 million\nof deferred income tax expense. Total tax expense for the year ended December 31,\n2014\n, was comprised of\n$1 million\nof current income tax benefit and\n$2.1 million\nof deferred income tax expense. Our current tax expense for each of these periods was less than our total tax expense in large part due to the impact of accelerated tax bonus depreciation and the utilization of percentage depletion.\nWe evaluate our deferred tax assets and liabilities each reporting period using the enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the periods in which the deferred tax liability or asset is expected to be settled or realized. The estimated statutory income tax rates that are applied to our current and deferred income tax calculations are impacted most significantly by the states in which we do business. Changing business conditions for normal business transactions and operations as well as changes to state tax rate and apportionment laws potentially alter our apportionment of income among the states for income tax purposes. These changes in apportionment laws result in changes in the calculation of our current and deferred income taxes, including the valuation of our deferred tax assets and liabilities. The effects of any such changes are recorded in the period of the adjustment. These adjustments can increase or decrease the net deferred tax asset on the balance sheet and impact the corresponding deferred tax benefit or deferred tax expense on the income statement.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nAs of\nDecember 31, 2016\n, we had cash and cash equivalents of\n$4.5 million\n, consisting primarily of cash.\nOur operations have been and are expected to be primarily funded from cash on hand and cash generated by operations. We also have the ability to borrow under our credit facility, to the extent available and subject to the limitations described below under the heading \"Credit Facility.\" We may use our credit facility as a source of liquidity for operating activities and to give us additional flexibility to finance, among other things, capital investments. We will continue to monitor our future sources and uses of cash and anticipate that we will make adjustments to our capital allocation strategies when, and if, determined by our Board of Directors. We expect that cash generated from operations combined with availability under our credit facility, will be sufficient to fund our operations in 2017.\n43\nTable of Contents\nWe expect to continue to look for opportunities to improve our capital structure by reducing or restructuring debt and its related interest expense. We may, at any time we deem conditions favorable, also attempt to improve our liquidity position by accessing equity markets in accordance with our existing debt agreements. We cannot provide any assurance that we will pursue any of these transactions or that we will be successful in completing them on acceptable terms or at all. In addition, under the terms of our senior notes, in December 2016, we engaged Cantor Fitzgerald & Co., a nationally-recognized investment bank, to assess, evaluate, and assist in pursuing potential strategic alternatives available to us, as we determine to be appropriate. These potential strategic alternatives could include, but are not limited to, continuing our current operating plan, equity offerings or balance sheet restructurings, merger and acquisition opportunities, partnership or joint venture opportunities, entering into new or complementary businesses, or a sale of Intrepid or some or all of our assets. This evaluation is ongoing.\nThe following summarizes our cash flow activity for the years ended December 31,\n2016\n,\n2015\n, and\n2014\n.\nYear ended December 31,\n2016\n2015\n2014\n(In thousands)\nCash flows (used in) provided by operating activities\n$(18,270\n)\n$22,690\n$127,486\nCash flows provided by (used in) investing activities\n$32,510\n$(79,577\n)\n$(59,624\n)\nCash flows used in financing activities\n$(19,083\n)\n$(1,395\n)\n$(667\n)\nOur debt agreements contain restrictions on our ability to declare and pay dividends. In general, the terms of our senior notes prohibit us from declaring and paying a dividend unless our leverage ratio is less than 3.5 to 1, our fixed charge coverage ratio after giving effect to the dividend would be greater than 1.3 to 1, and our cash on hand and availability under our credit facility after giving effect to the dividend, would not be less than $15 million. In addition, the terms of our credit facility prohibit us from declaring and paying a dividend unless availability under the credit facility after giving effect to the dividend and during a specified period before the dividend is more than $10 million. More information about how the financial ratios are calculated under our debt agreements is provided below under the heading \"Senior Notes.\"\nOperating Activities\nTotal cash used in operating activities for the year ended December 31,\n2016\n, was\n$18.3 million\n, a decrease of\n$41.0 million\ncompared with the year ended December 31,\n2015\n. The primary driver of this decrease was lower prices for potash and Trio\n\u00ae\n, as discussed above, which resulted in a net loss.\nTotal cash provided by operating activities decreased by\n$104.8 million\nin\n2015\ncompared to\n2014\n. The primary driver of this increase was higher sales volumes at a lower average net realized sales price per ton for potash which, together, resulted in lower net income.\nInvesting Activities\nTotal cash provided by investing activities increased\n$112.1 million\nin\n2016\ncompared to\n2015\nprimarily as a result of the increase in proceeds from the sale of investments to fund our operations in\n2016\nas compared to\n2015\n. Total cash used in investing activities increased\n$20.0 million\nin\n2015\ncompared to\n2014\nprimarily as a result of the increase in purchases of investments partially offset by decreased capital investment in 2014.\nFinancing Activities\nTotal cash flows used in financing activities increased $17.7 million in\n2016\nas compared to\n2015\nprimarily due to the repayment of $15 million of our senior notes (the \"Notes\") and $3.9 million of debt issuance costs in October 2016.\nSenior Notes\nAs of December 31, 2016, after the repayment of $15 million of the Notes in October 2016, the Notes consist of the following series.\n\u2022\n$54 million of Senior Notes, Series A, due April 16, 2020\n\u2022\n$40.5 million of Senior Notes, Series B, due April 14, 2023\n\u2022\n$40.5 million of Senior Notes, Series C, due April 16, 2025\nWe originally issued $150 million aggregate principal amount of the Notes in April 2013 pursuant to a note purchase agreement entered into in August 2012. On October 3, 2016, we repaid $15 million of the Notes as part of negotiations relating to our previous noncompliance with financial covenants under the Notes. On October 31, 2016, we entered into a revised note purchase agreement governing the Notes. In the first quarter of 2017, we repaid an additional $5.5 million of the Notes in connection with the sale of an asset.\n44\nTable of Contents\nUnder the original note purchase agreement, we were subject to financial covenants consisting of a maximum leverage ratio and a minimum fixed charge coverage ratio as specified in the note purchase agreement. We were not in compliance with these financial covenants as of March 31, 2016, June 30, 2016, or September 30, 2016. Under a series of waivers entered into during the first nine months of 2016 and the revised note purchase agreement, the holders of the Notes permanently waived the requirement that we comply with these financial covenants for the quarters ended March 31, 2016, June 30, 2016, and September 30, 2016 (and agreed that any noncompliance with these covenants for the quarters ended March 31, 2016, June 30, 2016, and September 30, 2016, would not constitute a default or event of default under the agreement). As part of these waivers, our interest rates on the Notes increased several times during\n2016.\nUnder the revised note purchase agreement, we granted to the collateral agent for the Noteholders a first lien on substantially all of our non-current assets and a second lien on substantially all of our current assets.\nThe revised note purchase agreement provides for the following changes to the Notes, among others.\n\u2022\nThe agreement includes a minimum adjusted EBITDA covenant, which adjusts over time and is measured quarterly through March 2018, ranging from negative $20 million in the quarter ended September 30, 2016, to negative $7.5 million in the quarter ending March 31, 2018. Adjusted EBITDA is a non-GAAP measure that is calculated as adjusted earnings before interest, income taxes, depreciation, amortization, and certain other expenses for the prior four quarters, as defined under the agreement.\n\u2022\nThe agreement requires us to maintain a minimum fixed charge coverage amount of negative $15 million and negative $10 million for the quarters ending June 30, 2018, and September 30, 2018, respectively. The agreement includes requirements relating to a leverage ratio and a fixed charge coverage ratio to be tested on a quarterly basis commencing with the quarter ending June 30, 2018, with respect to the leverage ratio, and December 31, 2018, with respect to the fixed charge coverage ratio. The maximum leverage ratio will be 11.5 to 1.0 for the quarter ending June 30, 2018, and decreases to 3.5 to 1.0 for the quarter ending September 30, 2019, and each quarter thereafter. The minimum fixed charge coverage ratio will be 0.25 to 1.0 for the quarter ending December 31, 2018, and increases to 1.3 to 1.0 for the quarter ending September 30, 2019, and each quarter thereafter. In general, our minimum fixed charge coverage is calculated as adjusted EBITDA for the prior four quarters, minus maintenance capital expenditures, cash paid for income taxes and interest expense, plus scheduled principal amortization of long-term funded indebtedness; our leverage ratio is calculated as the ratio of funded indebtedness to adjusted EBITDA for the prior four quarters, and our fixed charge coverage ratio is calculated as the ratio of adjusted EBITDA for the prior four quarters, minus maintenance capital expenditures and cash paid for income taxes, to interest expense plus scheduled principal amortization of long-term funded indebtedness.\n\u2022\nThe interest rates for the Notes increased by 4.5% above the previous rates such that, as of December 31, 2016, the Series A Senior Notes bear interest at 7.73%, the Series B Senior Notes bear interest at 8.63%, and the Series C Senior Notes bear interest at 8.78%, which reflect the highest rates in a pricing grid. These interest rates are based on a pricing grid set forth in the revised agreement and will be adjusted quarterly based upon our financial performance and certain financial covenant levels. In addition, additional interest of 2%, which may be paid in kind, will begin to accrue on April 1, 2018, unless we satisfy certain financial covenant tests.\n\u2022\nWe are required to make certain offers to prepay the Notes with the proceeds of dispositions of certain specified property and with the proceeds of certain equity issuances, as set forth in the agreement.\nOur outstanding long-term debt, net, as of December 31, 2016 and 2015 (in thousands) is as follows.\nDecember 31,\n2016\n2015\nSenior Notes\n$135,000\n$150,000\nLess deferred financing costs\n(1,566\n)\n(515\n)\nLong-term debt, net\n$133,434\n$149,485\nWe were in compliance with our financial covenants as of December 31, 2016. The obligations under the Notes are unconditionally guaranteed by several of our subsidiaries.\nCredit Facility\nOn October 31, 2016, we entered into a credit agreement with Bank of Montreal that provides an asset-based revolving credit facility of up to $35 million in aggregate principal amount. The amount available is subject to monthly borrowing base limits based upon our inventory and receivables. If our total remaining availability under the credit facility falls below $6 million, we would be subject to a minimum fixed charge coverage ratio of 1 to 1. Any borrowings on the credit facility will\n45\nTable of Contents\nbear interest at 1.75% to 2.25% above LIBOR (London Interbank Offered Rate), based on average availability under the credit facility. We have granted to Bank of Montreal a first lien on substantially all of our current assets and a second lien on substantially all of our non-current assets. The credit facility expires on October 31, 2018. As of December 31, 2016, there were no amounts outstanding under the facility, other than a $0.5 million letter of credit. We may occasionally borrow and repay amounts under the facility for near-term working capital needs.\nPrevious Credit Facility\nDuring the third quarter of 2016, we maintained an unsecured credit facility. Under a series of amendments during 2016, the maximum amount available to us was reduced from $250 million to $1 million, which amount could be used only for letters of credit. Further, the maturity date on this facility was accelerated to September 30, 2016. The credit facility matured according to its terms on September 30, 2016, and therefore is no longer outstanding. As of December 31, 2016, we had a $0.5 million letter of credit outstanding secured by a restricted cash account.\nCapital Investments\nWe expect our level of capital investment to be approximately $13 million to $18 million for 2017, the majority of which we expect to be sustaining capital. We anticipate our 2017 operating plans and capital programs will be funded out of operating cash flows and existing cash. We may also use our revolving credit facility, to the extent available, to fund capital investments.\nDuring 2016, we paid cash of\n$17.9 million\nfor capital projects, the majority of which was sustaining capital and amounts to transition our East facility to a Trio\n\u00ae\n-only facility.\nContractual Obligations\nAs of December 31,\n2016\n, we had contractual obligations totaling\n$290.0 million\non an undiscounted basis, as indicated below. Contractual commitments shown are for the full calendar year indicated unless otherwise indicated.\nPayments Due By Period\nTotal\n2017\n2018\n2019\n2020\n2021\nMore Than 5 Years\n(In thousands)\nLong-term debt\n$135,000\n$\u2014\n$\u2014\n$\u2014\n$54,000\n$\u2014\n$81,000\nVariable rate interest obligations on long-term debt\n1\n67,553\n11,225\n11,225\n11,225\n9,138\n7,051\n17,689\nOperating lease obligations\n2\n8,236\n3,175\n2,598\n809\n548\n230\n876\nPurchase commitments\n3\n4,065\n4,065\n\u2014\n\u2014\n\u2014\n\u2014\n\u2014\nAsset retirement obligation\n4\n59,323\n35\n1,622\n\u2014\n1,000\n1,325\n55,341\nMinimum royalty payments\n5\n15,867\n635\n635\n635\n635\n635\n12,692\nTotal\n$290,044\n$19,135\n$16,080\n$12,669\n$65,321\n$9,241\n$167,598\n1\nSee \"Senior Notes\" section above for more detail on the variable rate interest associated with our long-term debt. Amounts in the table above represent interest calculated at rates in effect as of December 31, 2016.\n2\nAmounts include all operating lease payments, inclusive of sales tax, for leases for office space, an airplane, railcars, and other equipment.\n3\nPurchase contractual commitments include the approximate amount due to vendors for non-cancelable purchase commitments for materials and services.\n4\nWe are obligated to reclaim and remediate lands that our operations have disturbed, but, because of the long-term nature of our reserves and facilities, we estimate that the majority of those expenditures will not be required until after 2021. Although our reclamation obligation activities are not required to begin until after we cease operations, we anticipate certain activities to occur prior to then related to reclamation of facilities that have been replaced with newly constructed assets, as well as certain shaft closure activities for shafts that are no longer in use. Commitments shown are in today's dollars and are undiscounted.\n5\nEstimated annual minimum royalties due under mineral leases, assuming approximately a 25-year life, consistent with estimated useful lives of plant assets.\n46\nTable of Contents\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nAs of December 31,\n2016\n, we had no off-balance sheet arrangements aside from the operating leases described above under\n\"Contractual Obligations\"\nand bonding obligations described in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nOur discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with GAAP. The preparation of the consolidated financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in our financial statements. Actual results could differ from our estimates and assumptions, and these differences could result in material changes to our financial statements. The following discussion presents information about our most critical accounting policies and estimates. Our significant accounting policies are further described in Note 2 to our consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31,\n2016\n, included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nRevenue Recognition\nRevenue is recognized when evidence of an arrangement exists, risks and rewards of ownership have been transferred to customers, which is generally when title passes, the selling price is fixed and determinable, and collection is reasonably assured. Title passes at the designated shipping point for the majority of sales, but, in a few cases, title passes at the delivery destination. The shipping point may be the plant, a distribution warehouse, a customer warehouse, or a port. Title passes for some international shipments upon payment by the purchaser; however, revenue is not recognized for these transactions until shipment because the risks and rewards of ownership have not transferred pursuant to a contractual arrangement. Prices are generally set at the time of, or prior to, shipment. In cases where the final price is determined after shipment and agreed to with our customer, revenue is recognized when the final sales price is fixed and determinable and the other revenue recognition criteria have been met.\nSales are reported on a gross basis. We quote prices to customers both on a delivered basis and on the basis of pick\u2010up at our plants and warehouses. When a sale occurs on a delivered basis, we incur and, in turn, bill the customer and record as gross revenue the product sales value, freight, packaging, and certain other distribution costs. Many customers, however, arrange and pay for these costs directly and, in these situations, only the product sales are included in gross revenues.\nApplication of this policy requires that we make estimates regarding creditworthiness of the customer, which impacts the timing of revenue recognition and, ultimately, the determination of allowance for doubtful accounts. We make those estimates based on the most recent information available and historical experience, but they may be affected by subsequent changes in market conditions.\nProperty, Plant, and Equipment\nProperty, plant, and equipment are stated at historical cost. Expenditures for property, plant, and equipment relating to new assets or improvements are capitalized, provided the expenditure extends the useful life of an asset or extends the asset's functionality. Property, plant, and equipment are depreciated under the straight-line method using estimated useful lives. No depreciation is taken on assets classified as construction in progress until the asset is placed into service. Gains or losses are recorded upon retirement, sale or disposal of assets. Maintenance and repair costs are recognized as period costs when incurred. Capitalized interest, to the extent of debt outstanding, is calculated and assigned to assets that are being constructed, drilled, being built or otherwise are classified as construction in progress.\nMineral Properties and Development Costs\nMineral properties and development costs, which are referred to collectively as mineral properties, include acquisition costs, the cost of drilling wells, and the cost of other development work, all of which are capitalized. Depletion of mineral properties is calculated using the units-of-production method over the estimated life of the relevant ore body. The lives of reserves used for accounting purposes are shorter than current reserve life determinations due to uncertainties inherent in long-term estimates. We have prepared these reserve life estimates and they have been reviewed and independently determined by mine consultants. Tons of potash and langbeinite in the proven and probable reserves are expressed in terms of expected finished tons of product to be realized, net of estimated losses. Market price fluctuations of potash or Trio\n\u00ae\n, as well as increased production costs or reduced recovery rates, could render proven and probable reserves containing relatively lower grades of mineralization uneconomic to exploit and might result in a reduction of reserves. In addition, the provisions of our mineral leases, including royalties payable, are subject to periodic readjustment by the state and federal government, which could affect the economics of our reserve estimates. Significant changes in the estimated reserves could have a material impact on our results of operations and financial position.\n47\nTable of Contents\nInventory and Long-Term Parts Inventory\nInventory consists of product and by-product stocks that are ready for sale; mined ore; potash in evaporation ponds, which is considered work-in-process; and parts and supplies inventory. Product and by-product inventory cost is determined using the lower of weighted average cost or estimated net realizable value and includes direct costs, maintenance, operational overhead, depreciation, depletion, and equipment lease costs applicable to the production process. Direct costs, maintenance, and operational overhead include labor and associated benefits.\nWe evaluate production levels and costs to determine if any should be deemed abnormal and therefore excluded from inventory costs and expensed directly during the applicable period. The assessment of normal production levels is judgmental and unique to each period. We model normal production levels and evaluate historical ranges of production by operating plant in assessing what is deemed to be normal.\nParts inventory, including critical spares, that is not expected to be used within a period of\none\nyear is classified as non-current. Parts and supply inventory cost is determined using the lower of average acquisition cost or estimated replacement cost. Detailed reviews are performed related to the net realizable value of parts inventory, giving consideration to quality, slow-moving items, obsolescence, excessive levels, and other factors. Parts inventories that have not turned over in more than a year, excluding parts classified as critical spares, are reviewed for obsolescence and, if deemed appropriate, are included in the determination of an allowance for obsolescence.\nRecoverability of Long-Lived Assets\nWe evaluate our long-lived assets for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the related carrying amount may not be recoverable. An impairment is considered to potentially exist if an asset group's total estimated future cash flows on an undiscounted basis are less than the carrying amount of the related asset. An impairment loss is measured and recorded based on the excess of the carrying amount of long-lived assets over its estimated fair value. Changes in significant assumptions underlying future cash flow estimates or fair values of asset groups may have a material effect on our financial position and results of operations. Sales price is a significant element of any cash flow estimate, particularly for higher cost operations. Other assumptions we estimate include, among other things, the economic life of the asset, sales volume, inflation, raw materials costs, cost of capital, tax rates and capital spending. These assumptions do not change in isolation; therefore, it is not practicable to present the impact of changing a single assumption.\nFactors we generally will consider important and which could trigger an impairment review of the carrying value of long-lived assets include the following.\n\u2022\nsignificant underperformance relative to expected operating results or operating losses\n\u2022\nsignificant changes in the manner of use of assets or the strategy for our overall business\n\u2022\nthe denial or delay of necessary permits or approvals that would affect the utilization of our tangible assets\n\u2022\nunderutilization of our tangible assets\n\u2022\ndiscontinuance of certain products by us or our customers\n\u2022\na decrease in estimated mineral reserves\n\u2022\nsignificant negative industry or economic trends\nAlthough we believe the carrying values of our long-lived assets were realizable as of the balance sheet dates, future events could cause us to conclude otherwise.\nAsset Retirement Obligation\nAll of our mining properties involve certain reclamation liabilities as required by the states in which they operate or by the BLM. Reclamation costs are initially recorded as a liability associated with the asset to be reclaimed or abandoned, based on applicable inflation assumptions and discount rates. The accretion of this discounted liability is recognized as expense over the life of the related assets, and the liability is periodically adjusted to reflect changes in the estimates of the time or amount of the reclamation and abandonment costs. These asset retirement obligations are reviewed and updated at least annually with any changes in balances recorded as adjustments to the related assets and liabilities. The estimates of amounts to be spent are subject to considerable uncertainty and long timeframes. Changes in these estimates could have a material impact on our results of operations and financial position.\nPlanned Turnaround Maintenance\nEach production operation typically shuts down periodically for planned maintenance activities. Our New Mexico operations have historically shut down for up to two weeks to perform turnaround maintenance. Generally, our HB, Moab, and Wendover operations cease harvesting potash from our solar ponds during one or more summer months to make the most of the evaporation season. During these summer turnarounds, annual maintenance is performed. The costs of maintenance turnarounds at our facilities are considered part of production costs and are absorbed into inventory in the period incurred.\n48\nTable of Contents\nIncome Taxes\nWe are a subchapter C corporation and therefore are subject to U.S. federal and state income taxes. We recognize income taxes under the asset and liability method. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the estimated future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using the enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the periods in which the deferred tax liability or asset is expected to be settled or realized. We record a valuation allowance if it is deemed more likely than not that our deferred income tax assets will not be realized in full; such determinations are subject to ongoing assessment.\nStock\u2010Based Compensation\nWe account for stock\u2010based compensation by recording expense using the fair value of the awards at the time of grant. We have recorded compensation expense associated with the issuance of restricted common stock, performance units, and non\u2010qualified stock options, all of which are subject to service conditions and in some cases are subject to operational or market based conditions. The expense associated with these awards is recognized over the service period associated with each issuance.\nNew Accounting Standards\nPronouncements Issued But Not Yet Adopted\nIn May 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (the \"FASB\") issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2014\u201009, \"Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606),\" which requires revenue to be recognized based on the amount an entity is expected to be entitled to for promised goods or services provided to customers. The standard also requires expanded disclosures regarding contracts with customers. The guidance in this standard supersedes the revenue recognition requirements in Topic 605, \"Revenue Recognition\", and most industry-specific guidance. This guidance is effective for us beginning January 1, 2018. We are analyzing our sales contracts, particularly those where the final pricing of our product is determined subsequent to shipment, in order to evaluate the impact on our consolidated financial statements.\nIn July 2015, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2015-11, \"Inventory (Topic 330): Simplifying the Measurement of Inventory.\" An entity using an inventory method other than last-in, first-out or the retail inventory method should measure inventory at the lower of cost and net realizable value. The new guidance clarifies that net realizable value is the estimated selling prices in the ordinary course of business, less reasonably predictable costs of completion, disposal, and transportation and is effective for us beginning January 1, 2017. We do not expect the adoption of this guidance to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements. As we finalize our conclusions, we may need to make changes to our business and accounting process to support recognition and disclosures under the new standard.\nIn February 2016, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2016-02, \"Leases (Topic 842),\" which requires, among other things, lessees to recognize lease assets and liabilities on their balance sheets for those leases classified as operating leases under previous generally accepted accounting principles. These assets and liabilities must be recorded generally at the present value of the contracted lease payments, and the cost of the lease must be allocated over the lease term on a straight-line basis. This guidance is effective for us for annual and interim periods in fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018, with a modified retrospective transition method mandated. We are currently in the process of gathering the data on our operating lease agreements in order to evaluate the potential impact on our consolidated financial statements.\nIn March 2016, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2016-09, \"Compensation - Stock Compensation (Topic 718): Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting.\" This standard changes several aspects of how we account for share-based payment award transactions, including income tax consequences, classification of awards as either equity or liabilities, classification of excess tax benefits on the statement of cash flows, forfeitures, minimum statutory tax withholding payments, and classification of employee taxes paid on the statement of cash flows when an employer withholds shares for tax-withholding purposes.

We do not expect the adoption of this guidance to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.\nIn August 2016, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2016-15, \"Statement of Cash Flows (Topic 230)\" which is intended to clarify and align how certain cash receipts and cash payments are presented and classified in the statement of cash flows where there is currently diversity in practice. ASU 2016-15 specifically addresses eight classification issues within the statement of cash flows including debt prepayments or debt extinguishment costs; proceeds from the settlement of insurance claims; and separately identifiable cash flows and application of the predominance principle.

This non-GAAP financial measure should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for, or superior to, the financial information prepared and presented in accordance with GAAP. In addition, because the presentation of this non-GAAP financial measure varies among companies, our presentation of this non-GAAP financial measure may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies.\nWe believe average net realized sales price per ton provides useful information to investors for analysis of our business. We also refer to this non-GAAP financial measure in assessing our performance and when planning, forecasting, and analyzing future periods. We believe this non-GAAP financial measure is used by professional research analysts and others in the valuation, comparison, and investment recommendations of companies in the potash mining industry. Many investors use the published research reports of these professional research analysts and others in making investment decisions.\nAverage net realized sales price per ton is calculated as sales, less freight costs, divided by the number of tons sold in the period. We consider average net realized sales price per ton to be useful because it shows average per-ton pricing without the effect of certain transportation and delivery costs. When we arrange transportation and delivery for a customer, we include in revenue and in freight costs the costs associated with transportation and delivery. However, many of our customers arrange for and pay their own transportation and delivery costs, in which case these costs are not included in our revenue and freight costs. We use average net realized sales price per ton as a key performance indicator to analyze sales and price trends.\nBelow is a reconciliation of average net realized sales price per ton to the most directly comparable GAAP measure for the years ended\nDecember 31, 2016\n,\n2015\n, and\n2014\n.\nYear Ended December 31, 2016\nPotash\nTrio\n\u00ae\nTotal\nSales\n$159,494\n$51,454\n$210,948\nFreight costs\n26,661\n9,595\n36,256\nSubtotal\n$132,833\n$41,859\n$174,692\nDivided by.\nTons sold (in thousands)\n681\n146\nAverage net realized sales price per ton\n$195\n$287\nYear Ended December 31, 2015\nPotash\nTrio\n\u00ae\nTotal\nSales\n$217,467\n$69,716\n$287,183\nFreight costs\n18,262\n10,461\n28,723\nSubtotal\n$199,205\n$59,255\n$258,460\nDivided by.\nTons sold (in thousands)\n587\n163\nAverage net realized sales price per ton\n$339\n$364\n50\nTable of Contents\nYear Ended December 31, 2014\nPotash\nTrio\n\u00ae\nTotal\nSales\n$334,323\n$76,066\n$410,389\nFreight costs\n30,615\n12,608\n43,223\nSubtotal\n$303,708\n$63,458\n$367,166\nDivided by.\nTons sold (in thousands)\n915\n182\nAverage net realized sales price per ton\n$332\n$349","68":"","69":"ITEM 7.\nMANAGEMENT\u2019S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nThe Company is organized into\ntwo\nreportable segments: Transportation and Logistics. The Transportation segment provides freight brokerage, last mile, LTL, full truckload, and global forwarding services. The Logistics segment provides a range of contract logistics services, including highly engineered and customized solutions, value-added warehousing and distribution, cold chain solutions and other inventory solutions.\nThe Company's Chief Executive Officer, who is the chief operating decision maker (\u201cCODM\u201d), regularly reviews financial information at the reporting segment level in order to make decisions about resources to be allocated to the segments and to assess their performance.

On October 30, 2015, XPO acquired Con-way Inc. (\u201cCon-way\u201d). Headquartered in Ann Arbor, Michigan, Con-way was a\nFortune 500\ncompany with a transportation and logistics network of 582 locations and approximately 30,000 employees serving over 36,000 customers. On June 8, 2015, XPO acquired a majority interest in Norbert Dentressangle SA (\u201cND\u201d), a leading provider of transportation and logistics services in Western Europe.\nThe increase in cost of transportation services of\n89.0%\nfrom\n2015\nto\n2016\nwas primarily the result of the acquisitions of ND, Con-way and BTT. As a percentage of revenue, cost of transportation and services decreased to\n53.9%\nin\n2016\ncompared to\n54.7%\nin\n2015\n, primarily as a result of a shift in the mix of our business with a more significant component of our revenue being attributable to the LTL and European transportation service offerings following the acquisitions of ND and Con-way. Cost of transportation and services typically represents a lower percentage of revenue in these service offerings than in our legacy asset-light transportation services. Cost of transportation and services is primarily attributable to the cost of providing or procuring freight transportation services for XPO customers, salaries paid to employee drivers in our full truckload and LTL businesses, and commissions paid to independent station owners in our global forwarding business.\nDirect operating expense for\n2016\nwas\n$4,594.1 million\n, or\n31.4%\nas a percentage of revenue, compared to\n$2,367.0 million\n, or\n31.0%\nas a percentage of revenue, for\n2015\n. Direct operating expense increased primarily due to the acquisitions of ND and Con-way and growth to support the last mile business. Direct operating expenses are both fixed and variable expenses and consist of operating costs related to our contract logistics facilities, intermodal equipment lease expense, depreciation expense, maintenance and repair costs, property taxes, operating costs of our local drayage and last mile warehousing facilities, the direct costs related to the LTL service centers and European pallet network, such as direct labor, facilities and forklift trucks, and fixed terminal and cargo handling expenses. Operating costs of our contract logistics facilities consist mainly of personnel costs, facility and equipment expenses, materials and supplies, information technology expenses, depreciation expense and other operating expenses related to our contract logistics facilities. Intermodal equipment maintenance and repair costs consist of the\n23\ncosts related to the maintenance of the intermodal equipment fleet. Operating costs of our local drayage and last mile warehousing facilities consist mainly of personnel costs, rent, maintenance, utilities and other facility related costs. Operating costs of our LTL facilities consist mainly of personnel costs, rent and depreciation of service center equipment. Fixed terminal and cargo handling costs primarily relate to the fixed rent and storage expense charged by terminal operators.\nSales, general and administrative expense (\u201cSG&A\u201d) increased to\n$1,651.2 million\nin\n2016\nfrom\n$1,113.4 million\nin\n2015\nprimarily due to SG&A associated with acquisitions. SG&A as a percentage of revenue decreased to\n11.3%\nin\n2016\nas compared to\n14.6%\nin\n2015.\nThe decrease is attributable to a reduction in acquisition-related costs, a change in the mix of the Company's business operations resulting from the acquisition of Con-way, and the cost saving measures being implemented as part of the integration of acquired businesses, particularly in our LTL service offering. SG&A consists of costs relating to customer acquisition, carrier procurement, billing, customer service, salaries and related expenses of the executive and administrative staff, acquisition-related costs, office expenses, technology services, professional fees and other purchased services relating to the aforementioned functions, and depreciation and amortization expense.\nForeign currency gain was\n$40.3 million\nin\n2016\ncompared to foreign currency loss of\n$44.8 million\nin\n2015\n. The gain in 2016 was primarily due to a\n$39.7 million\ngain on unrealized foreign currency option and forward contracts. The loss in 2015 was primarily due to\n$31.7 million\nforeign currency transaction and remeasurement losses on the cash held to purchase ND and a\n$9.7 million\nloss on the forward contract related to the ND acquisition.\nThe debt extinguishment loss of\n$69.7 million\nin\n2016\nincludes\n$35.2 million\nfrom the redemption of the Senior Notes due 2019,\n$18.0 million\nfrom the refinancing of the Term Loan, and\n$16.5 million\nfrom the repurchase of Term Loan debt.\nInterest expense for\n2016\nincreased\n66.6%\nto\n$361.1 million\nfrom\n$216.7 million\nin\n2015\n. The increase in interest expense was primarily attributable to the increased indebtedness incurred by the Company in order to fund the 2015 acquisitions of Con-way and ND. Average total indebtedness increased approximately\n72%\nfrom 2015 to 2016, consistent with the increase in interest expense.\nOur effective income tax rates in\n2016\nand\n2015\nwere\n20.9%\nand\n32.2%\n, respectively. The\n2016\neffective tax rate was lower than the U.S. statutory tax rate primarily due to a revaluation of deferred tax liabilities resulting from an enacted tax law change in France that lowers the statutory tax rate, a release of previously provided uncertain tax benefits due to a favorable non-U.S. tax audit settlement, and the recognition of excess tax benefits in 2016. The\n2015\neffective tax rate was lower than the U.S. statutory tax rate primarily due to a pretax book loss and changes in the geographic earnings mix. For both periods, the effective income tax rates reflect the Company\u2019s intention to permanently reinvest earnings of its foreign subsidiaries.\nYear Ended December 31,\n2015\nCompared to Year Ended December 31,\n2014\nOur consolidated revenue for\n2015\nincreased\n223.5%\nto\n$7,623.2 million\nfrom\n$2,356.6 million\nin\n2014\n. This increase was driven largely by the acquisitions ND, Con-way, BTT and UX and the inclusion of a full year of results from the 2014 acquisitions of New Breed Holding Company (\u201cNew Breed\u201d) and Simply Logistics, Inc. d\/b\/a Atlantic Central Logistics (\u201cACL\u201d), as well as organic growth.\nThe increase in cost of transportation services of\n145.1%\nfrom\n2014\nto\n2015\nwas primarily the result of the acquisitions of ND, Con-way and BTT. As a percentage of revenue, cost of transportation and services decreased to\n54.7%\nin\n2015\ncompared to\n72.2%\nin\n2014\n, primarily as a result of a shift in the mix of our business with a more significant component of our revenue being attributable to our Logistics segment following the acquisitions of ND and Con-way. Cost of transportation and services typically represents a substantially lower percentage of revenue in our Logistics segment than in our Transportation segment due to the more limited proportional role of transportation services provided to our Logistics segment customers.\nDirect operating expense for\n2015\nwas\n$2,367.0 million\n, or\n31.0%\nas a percentage of revenue, compared to\n$273.2 million\n, or\n11.6%\nas a percentage of revenue, for\n2014\n. Direct operating expense increased due to the acquisitions of ND and Con-way, and the inclusion of a full year of New Breed\u2019s results.\nSG&A expense increased by\n$690.9 million\nin\n2015\ncompared to\n2014\n. As a percentage of revenue, SG&A expense decreased to\n14.6%\nin\n2015\nas compared to\n17.9%\nin\n2014\n. SG&A expense increased primarily due to SG&A expense associated with new acquisitions and increased intangible amortization related to acquisitions.\nForeign currency loss increased to\n$44.8 million\nfrom\n$0.4 million\nin\n2014\n. The increase was primarily due to\n$31.7 million\nforeign currency transaction and remeasurement losses on the cash held to purchase ND and a\n$9.7 million\nloss on the forward contract related to the ND acquisition.\nInterest expense for\n2015\nincreased\n351.5%\nto\n$216.7 million\nfrom\n$48.0 million\nin\n2014\n. The increase in interest expense was primarily attributable to the increased indebtedness incurred by the Company in order to fund the 2015 acquisitions of Con-way and ND.\nOur effective income tax rates in\n2015\nand\n2014\nwere\n32.2%\nand\n29.1%\n, respectively. The effective tax rates were influenced by various non-deductible transaction costs and costs related to conversions of our convertible debt, the change in valuation\n24\nallowances, and the mix of income among the various jurisdictions in which the Company does business. For both periods, our effective income tax rates reflect the Company\u2019s intention and ability to permanently reinvest earnings of its foreign subsidiaries.\nTransportation\nSummary Financial Table\nFor the Year Ended December 31,\nPercent of Revenue\n(Dollars in millions)\n2016\n2015\n2014\n2016\n2015\n2014\nRevenue\n$9,457.3\n$4,924.4\n$2,140.0\n100.0%\n100.0%\n100.0%\nCost of transportation and services\n6,796.4\n3,718.8\n1,701.8\n71.9%\n75.5%\n79.5%\nDirect operating expense\n1,199.2\n507.1\n90.0\n12.7%\n10.3%\n4.2%\nSG&A expense\nSalaries & benefits\n560.2\n340.7\n175.0\n5.9%\n6.9%\n8.2%\nOther SG&A expense\n153.6\n129.4\n56.4\n1.6%\n2.6%\n2.6%\nPurchased services\n147.5\n44.7\n20.4\n1.6%\n0.9%\n1.0%\nDepreciation & amortization\n162.4\n132.1\n77.5\n1.7%\n2.7%\n3.6%\nTotal SG&A expense\n1,023.7\n646.9\n329.3\n10.8%\n13.1%\n15.4%\nOperating income\n$438.0\n$51.6\n$18.9\n4.6%\n1.1%\n0.9%\nNote: Total depreciation and amortization for the Transportation segment included in cost of transportation and services, direct operating expense and SG&A was\n$449.1 million\n,\n$226.5 million\nand\n$79.5 million\nfor the years ended December 31,\n2016\n,\n2015\n, and\n2014\n, respectively.\nTransportation\nYear Ended December 31,\n2016\nCompared to Year Ended December 31,\n2015\nRevenue in our Transportation segment increased by\n92.0%\nto\n$9,457.3 million\nin\n2016\ncompared to\n$4,924.4 million\nin\n2015\n.

The terms of the new term loan facility are otherwise substantially consistent with the term loan that was replaced.\nIn addition, the Company borrowed an additional $400.0 million of Incremental Term B-1 Loans (the \u201cIncremental Term B-1 Loans\u201d) and an additional $50.0 million of Incremental Term B-2 Loans (the \u201cIncremental Term B-2 Loans\u201d). The New Term Loans, Incremental Term B-1 Loans and Incremental Term B-2 Loans have identical terms, other than with respect to original issue discount, and will mature on October 30, 2021.\nIssuance of Senior Notes Due 2023\nOn August 25, 2016, the Company completed a private placement of $535.0 million in aggregate principal amount of 6.125% senior notes due September 1, 2023 (\u201cSenior Notes due 2023\u201d). The Senior Notes due 2023 bear interest at a rate of 6.125% per annum payable semiannually, in cash in arrears, on March 1 and September 1 of each year, commencing March 1, 2017 and mature on September 1, 2023.\nRedemption of Senior Notes due 2019\nOn September 12, 2016 (the \u201cRedemption Date\u201d), the Company redeemed all of its outstanding 7.875% Notes due 2019 (the \u201c2019 Notes\u201d) issued under the Indenture, dated as of August 25, 2014, between XPO and The Bank of New York Mellon Trust Company, N.A., as Trustee. The redemption price for the 2019 Notes was 103.938% of the principal amount of the 2019 Notes, plus accrued and unpaid interest to, but excluding, the Redemption Date.\nNorth American Truckload Operations\nOn October 27, 2016, pursuant to a Stock Purchase Agreement of the same date between the Company and a subsidiary of TransForce Inc. (\u201cTransForce\u201d), the Company divested its North American Truckload operations (formerly known as Con-way Truckload) for approximately\n$558.0 million\ncash consideration, subject to certain adjustments. On November 3, 2016, the Company used the proceeds from sale of the North American Truckload operations to repurchase\n$555.0 million\nof Term Loan debt at par.\nGeneral\nAs of\nDecember 31, 2016\n, we had\n$342.0 million\nof working capital, including cash and cash equivalents of\n$373.4 million\n, compared to working capital of\n$262.8 million\n, including cash and cash equivalents of\n$289.8 million\n, as of December 31,\n2015\n. This increase of\n$79.2 million\nin working capital during the period was mainly due to an increase in cash and accounts receivable, partially offset by an increase in accrued expenses.\nWe continually evaluate our liquidity requirements, capital needs and the availability of capital resources based on our operating needs and our planned growth initiatives. In addition to using existing cash balances and net cash provided by operating activities, in certain circumstances we may use debt financings and issuances of equity or equity-related securities to fund our operating needs and growth initiatives. We believe that cash generated from operations, our existing cash balance, and availability of capacity to draw down under our ABL Facility will be sufficient to support our existing operations over the next 12 months.\nCash Flow\nDuring\n2016\n, the Company generated\n$625.4 million\nof cash from operations compared to\n$90.8 million\ngenerated in\n2015\nand\n$21.3 million\nused in\n2014\n. Cash flows from operations increased in\n2016\nprimarily due to the improvement in profitability. An increase in the Company's accounts receivable reduced our cash from operations by\n$153.7 million\nin\n2016\ncompared to\n$7.8 million\nof cash provided in\n2015.\nInvesting activities provided\n$142.0 million\nof cash in\n2016\ncompared to\n$4,085.4 million\nused in\n2015\nand\n$858.3 million\nused in\n2014\n. During\n2016\n, the Company received\n$547.7 million\nfrom the sale of its North American Truckload operations, used\n$483.4 million\nof cash to purchase fixed assets and received\n$68.9 million\nfrom the sale of assets. During\n2015\n, the Company used\n$3,887.0 million\nof cash in acquisitions,\n$249.0 million\nto purchase fixed assets and received\n$60.3 million\nfrom the sale of assets. During\n2014\n, the Company used\n$814.0 million\nof cash in acquisitions and\n$44.6 million\nto purchase fixed assets.\n27\nFinancing activities used\n$680.8 million\nin\n2016\ncompared to\n$3,644.9 million\ngenerated in\n2015\nand\n$1,502.2 million\ngenerated in\n2014\n. The primary use of cash in 2016 was the\n$1,889.2 million\nrepurchase of debt and the\n$151.4 million\nrepayment of debt and capital leases. The main source of cash from financing activities in\n2016\nwas the\n$1,352.0 million\nof net proceeds from the issuance of long-term debt. In\n2015\n, our primary source of cash was the\n$4,108.9 million\nof net proceeds from the issuance of long-term debt and\n$1,228.1 million\nof net proceeds from the issuance of preferred and common stock. The primary uses of cash from financing activities were the repayment of\n$1,215.6 million\nof debt and the purchase of the noncontrolling interest in ND of\n$459.7 million\n. During\n2014\n, the Company received\n$1,097.4 million\nof net proceeds from the issuance of preferred and common stock and\n$489.6 million\nof net proceeds from the issuance of long-term debt.\nDebt Facilities\nOn October 30, 2015, the Company entered into the Second Amended and Restated Revolving Loan Credit Agreement (the \u201cABL Facility\u201d) among XPO and certain of XPO\u2019s U.S. and Canadian wholly owned subsidiaries (which include the U.S. subsidiaries of the former Con-way), as borrowers, the other credit parties from time to time party thereto, the lenders party thereto and Morgan Stanley Senior Funding, Inc., as agent for such lenders. The ABL Facility replaced XPO\u2019s existing Amended Credit Agreement, and, among other things, (i) increased the commitments under the ABL Facility to\n$1.0 billion\n, (ii) permitted the acquisition of Con-way and the transactions relating thereto, (iii) reduced the margin on loans under the ABL Facility by 0.25% from that contained in the existing Amended Credit Agreement and (iv) matures on October 30, 2020. Up to $350 million of the ABL Facility is available for issuance of letters of credit, and up to $50 million of the ABL Facility is available for swing line loans. At\nDecember 31, 2016\n, the Company had a borrowing base of\n$986.5 million\nand availability under the ABL Facility of\n$717.4 million\nafter considering outstanding advances of\n$30.0 million\nand outstanding letters of credit of\n$239.1 million\n. As of\nDecember 31, 2016\n, the Company was in compliance with the ABL Facility\u2019s financial covenants.\nContractual Obligations\nThe following table reflects our contractual obligations as of December 31,\n2016\n.\n(Dollars in millions)\nPayments Due by Period\nContractual Obligations\nTotal\nLess than 1\nYear\n1 to 3\nYears\n3 to 5\nYears\nMore than 5\nYears\nCapital leases payable\n$101.9\n$18.3\n$34.5\n$18.2\n$30.9\nOperating leases\n2,144.3\n542.1\n737.3\n385.6\n479.3\nPurchase commitments\n158.6\n59.0\n70.8\n28.8\n\u2014\nLong-term debt\n5,044.2\n121.7\n333.2\n2,055.6\n2,533.7\nInterest on long-term debt\n1,640.3\n275.3\n515.4\n484.0\n365.6\nTotal contractual cash obligations\n$9,089.3\n$1,016.4\n$1,691.2\n$2,972.2\n$3,409.5\nActual amounts of contractual cash obligations may differ from estimated amounts due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates. We do not have any other material commitments that have not been disclosed elsewhere.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nThe Company guarantees the lease payments of certain tractor and trailer equipment utilized by subcontract carriers. These guarantees continue through the end of the lease of the equipment, which is typically four years. The maximum amount of the guarantee is limited to the amount of unpaid principal and interest. As of\nDecember 31, 2016\n, the maximum amount of these guarantees was approximately\n$20.8 million.\nCritical Accounting Estimates\nWe prepare our Consolidated Financial Statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. These principles require management to make estimates and assumptions that impact the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the Consolidated Financial Statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period.\nWe review our estimates for, including but not limited to: defined benefit pension plans, recoverability of long-lived assets, income taxes, goodwill, and self-insurance accruals, on a regular basis and make adjustments based on historical experiences and existing and expected future conditions. These evaluations are performed and adjustments are made as information is available. Management believes that these estimates are reasonable and has discussed them with the audit committee of our board of directors. However, actual results could differ from these estimates.\nNote 2\nto our Consolidated Financial Statements includes a summary of the significant accounting policies and methods used in the preparation of our Consolidated Financial Statements. The following is a discussion of our critical accounting estimates.\n28\nDefined Benefit Pension Plans\nDefined benefit pension plan benefits are calculated using various actuarial assumptions and methodologies. Assumptions include discount rates, inflation rates, expected long-term rate of return on plan assets, mortality rates, and other factors. The assumptions used in recording the projected benefit obligation and fair value of plan assets represent our best estimates based on information available regarding historical experience and factors that may cause future expectations to differ from past experiences. Differences in actual experience or changes in assumptions could materially impact our obligation and future expense amounts.\nDiscount Rate\nIn determining the appropriate discount rate for the U.S. Plans (which consist of a primary qualified defined benefit pension plan and another qualified defined benefit pension plan (the \u201cU.S. Qualified Plans\u201d)) and non-qualified defined benefit pension plans (collectively, the \u201cU.S. Non-Qualified Pension Plans\u201d and together with the U.S. Qualified Plans, the \u201cU.S. Plans\u201d)), we are assisted by actuaries who utilize a yield-curve model based on a universe of high-grade corporate bonds (rated AA or better by Moody's or S&P rating services). The model determines a single equivalent discount rate by applying the yield curve to expected future benefit payments.\nIn determining the appropriate discount rate for the UK Plan, we are assisted by consultants who utilize a yield-curve model based on the iBoxx universe of high-grade corporate bonds (rated AA or better by Moody\u2019s, S&P or Fitch rating services). The model determines a single equivalent discount rate by applying the yield curve to expected future benefit payments.\nThe discount rates used in determining the benefit obligation are as follows.\n2016\n2015\nU.S. Plans\n4.35%\n4.65%\nUK Plan\n2.70%\n3.75%\nRate of Return on Plan Assets\nFor the U.S. Qualified Plans, we set the expected return on plan assets using current market expectations and historical returns. The expected return on plan assets is based on estimates of long-term expected returns and considers the plans' anticipated asset allocation over the course of the next year. The expected return includes the effect of actively managing the plan assets, and is net of fees and expenses. The plan assets are managed pursuant to a long-term allocation strategy that seeks to mitigate the plans' funded status volatility by increasing the plans' investment in fixed-income investments over time. This strategy was developed by analyzing a variety of diversified asset-class combinations in conjunction with the projected liabilities of the plans. For the year ended\nDecember 31, 2016\n, our expected return on plan assets was\n$88.4 million\nfor U.S. Qualified Plans and\n$58.4 million\nfor the UK Plan, compared to the actual return on plan assets of\n$140.8 million\nfor U.S. Qualified Plans and\n$291.4 million\nfor the UK Plan. The actual annualized return on plan assets for the U.S. Qualified Plans for the year ended\nDecember 31, 2016\nwas approximately\n9%\n, which was above the expected return on asset assumption for the year as a result of strong performance of the fixed income portfolio, which made up approximately three-fourths of total plan assets. The actual annualized return on plan assets for the UK Plan for the year ended\nDecember 31, 2016\nwas approximately\n24%\n, which was above the expected return on asset assumption for the year as a result of strong performance across all asset classes.\nFor the UK Plan, we set the expected return on plan assets using market expectations and historical returns. The expected return on plan assets is based on estimates of long-term expected returns and considers the plans\u2019 anticipated asset allocation over the course of the next year. The expected return includes the effect of actively managing the plan assets and is net of fees and expenses.\nActuarial Gains and Losses\nChanges in the discount rate and\/or differences between the expected and actual rate of return on plan assets results in unrecognized actuarial gains or losses. For our defined benefit pension plans, accumulated unrecognized actuarial losses were\n$35.8 million\nfor the U.S. Plans and\n$28.9 million\nfor the UK Plan at\nDecember 31, 2016.\nThe portion of the unrecognized actuarial gain\/loss that exceeds 10% of the greater of the projected benefit obligation or the fair value of plan assets at the beginning of the year is amortized and recognized as income\/expense over the estimated average remaining life expectancy of plan participants.\nEffect on Operating Results\nThe effects of the defined benefit pension plans on our operating results consist primarily of the net effect of the interest cost on plan obligations for the U.S. Plans and the UK Plan and the expected return on plan assets for the funded defined benefit pension plans. We estimate that the defined benefit pension plans will result in annual income of\n$15.4 million\nfor the U.S. Plans and\n$26.0 million\nfor the UK Plan in\n2017\n. We recognized net periodic benefit income of\n$27.5 million\nin\n2016\nand\n$8.2 million\nin\n2015.\n29\nSignificant Assumption Sensitivity\nThe sensitivity analysis below shows the effect on 2017 estimated net periodic benefit income from a 25 basis point change in the assumed discount rate.\n(Dollars in millions)\n25 Basis Point Increase\n25 Basis Point Decrease\nDiscount rate\nU.S. Plans\nUK Plan\nU.S. Plans\nUK Plan\nEffect on 2017 estimated net periodic benefit expense (income)\n$4.5\n$3.1\n$(4.5\n)\n$(3.1\n)\nThe sensitivity analysis below shows the effect on 2017 estimated net periodic benefit income from a 25 basis point change in the expected return on plan assets.\n(Dollars in millions)\n25 Basis Point Increase\n25 Basis Point Decrease\nExpected return on plan assets\nU.S. Qualified Plans\nUK Plan\nU.S. Qualified Plans\nUK Plan\nEffect on 2017 estimated net periodic benefit expense (income)\n$(4.3\n)\n$(3.0\n)\n$4.3\n$3.0\nFunding\nIn determining the amount and timing of pension contributions for the U.S. Plans, we consider our cash position, the funded status as measured by the Pension Protection Act of 2006 (the \u201cPPA\u201d) and generally accepted accounting principles, and the tax deductibility of contributions, among other factors. We made contributions of\n$5.4 million\nand\n$0.9 million\nto the U.S. Non-Qualified Plans in\n2016\nand\n2015\n, respectively. We estimate that we will make\n$5.4 million\nof contributions to the U.S. Non-Qualified Plans in\n2017\n. We made\nno\ncontributions to the U.S. Qualified Plans in\n2016\nand\n2015\n. We do not anticipate making any contributions to the U.S. Qualified Plans in\n2017.\nFor the UK Plan, the amount and timing of pension contributions is determined in accordance with UK pension codes and trustee negotiations. We made contributions of\n$14.2 million\nand\n$10.3 million\nto the UK Plan in\n2016\nand\n2015\n, respectively. We estimate that we will make\n$12.7 million\nof contributions to the UK Plan in\n2017.\nThe impact of plan amendments and actuarial gains and losses are recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income\/loss, and are generally amortized as a component of net periodic benefit cost over the remaining service period of the active employees covered by the defined benefit pension plans. Unamortized gains and losses are amortized only to the extent they exceed\n10%\nof the higher of the fair value of plan assets or the projected benefit obligation of the respective plan. For additional information, refer to\nNote 10\n\u2014Employee Benefit Plans.\nRecoverability of Long-Lived Assets\nThe depreciation or amortization of our capital assets over their estimated useful lives, and the determination of any salvage values, requires management to make judgments about future events. Because we utilize many of our capital assets over relatively long periods, we periodically evaluate whether adjustments to our estimated service lives or salvage values are necessary to ensure these estimates properly match the economic use of the asset. This evaluation may result in changes in the estimated lives and residual values used to depreciate our tractors, trailers and other equipment. These estimates affect the amount of depreciation expense recognized in a period and, ultimately, the gain or loss on the disposal of the asset. Changes in the estimated lives of assets will result in an increase or decrease in the amount of depreciation recognized in future periods and could have a material impact on our results of operations. Historically, gains and losses on disposals of operating equipment have not been material. However, such amounts may differ materially in the future due to changes in business levels, technological obsolescence, accident frequency, regulatory changes and other factors beyond our control.\nIncome Taxes\nOur annual effective tax rate is based on our income, statutory tax rates and tax planning opportunities available to us in the various jurisdictions in which we operate. Tax laws are complex and subject to different interpretations by the taxpayer and respective governmental taxing authorities. Significant judgment is required in determining our tax expense and in evaluating our tax positions, including evaluating uncertainties. We review our tax positions quarterly as new information becomes available. Our income tax rate is affected by the mix of income between our domestic and foreign operations. In general, deferred tax liabilities have not been recorded for foreign earnings because it is our practice and intention to reinvest the earnings of our non-U.S. subsidiaries in those operations. Due to the uncertainty caused by various methods in which such earnings could be repatriated, it is not practicable to estimate the amount of deferred tax liability related to investments in these foreign subsidiaries.\nDeferred income tax assets represent amounts available to reduce income taxes payable in future years. Such assets arise because of temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities, as well as from net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards. We evaluate the recoverability of these future tax deductions and credits by\n30\nassessing all available evidence, including the reversal of the deferred tax liabilities, carrybacks available and historical and projected pre-tax profits generated by our operations. These sources of income rely heavily on estimates. The future settlement of deferred tax liabilities, which will enable the Company to realize its existing deferred tax assets when they reverse, was the most significant factor in our determination of the valuation allowance under the \u201cmore likely than not\u201d criteria. To the extent we do not consider it more likely than not that a deferred tax asset will be recovered, a valuation allowance is established.\nEvaluation of Goodwill Impairment\nGoodwill consists of the excess of cost over the fair value of net assets acquired in business combinations. Goodwill is tested for impairment annually or more frequently if an event or circumstance indicates that an impairment loss may have been incurred. Application of the goodwill impairment test requires judgment, including: the identification of reporting units; assignment of assets and liabilities to reporting units; assignment of goodwill to reporting units; and a determination of the fair value of each reporting unit.\nWe estimate the fair value of our reporting units using an income approach based on the present value of estimated future cash flows. We review goodwill for impairment utilizing a two-step process. The first step of the impairment test requires a comparison of the fair value of each of our reporting units' net assets to the respective carrying value of net assets. If the carrying value of a reporting unit's net assets is less than its fair value, no indication of impairment exists and a second step is not performed. If the carrying amount of a reporting unit's net assets is higher than its fair value, there is an indication that an impairment may exist and a second step must be performed. In the second step, the impairment is calculated by comparing the implied fair value of the reporting unit's goodwill (as if purchase accounting were performed on the testing date) with the carrying amount of the goodwill. If the carrying amount of the reporting unit's goodwill is greater than the implied fair value of its goodwill, an impairment loss must be recognized for the excess and charged to operations.\nInherent in our preparation of cash flow projections are assumptions and estimates derived from a review of our operating results, business plans, expected growth rates, cost of capital and tax rates. We also make certain forecasts about future economic conditions, interest rates and other market data. Many of the factors used in assessing fair value are outside the control of management, and these assumptions and estimates may change in future periods. Changes in assumptions or estimates could materially affect the estimate of the fair value of a reporting unit, and therefore could affect the likelihood and amount of potential impairment.\nWe completed our goodwill impairment test for our identified reporting units as of August 31, 2016. Based on the analysis prepared, the fair value of our reporting units substantially exceeded the carrying value at the testing date.\nSelf-Insurance Accruals\nThe Company uses a combination of self-insurance programs and large-deductible purchased insurance to provide for the costs of medical, vehicular, cargo and workers' compensation claims. The long-term portion of self-insurance accruals relates primarily to workers' compensation and vehicular claims that are expected to be payable over several years. The Company periodically evaluates the level of insurance coverage and adjusts insurance levels based on risk tolerance and premium expense. The measurement and classification of self-insured costs requires the consideration of historical cost experience, demographic and severity factors, and judgments about the current and expected levels of cost per claim and retention levels. These methods provide estimates of undiscounted liability associated with claims incurred as of the balance sheet date, including estimates of claims incurred but not reported. The Company believes the actuarial methods are appropriate for measuring these highly judgmental self-insurance accruals. However, based on the magnitude of claims and the length of time from incurrence of the claims to ultimate settlement, the use of any estimation method is sensitive to the assumptions and factors described above. Accordingly, changes in these assumptions and factors can materially affect the estimated liability and those amounts may be different than the actual costs paid to settle the claims.","70":"ITEM 7.

Our mission is to meet the universal need for human connection. We operate location-based social networks for meeting new people on mobile platforms, including on iPhone, Android, iPad and other tablets, and on the web that facilitates interactions among users and encourages users to connect and chat with each other. Given consumer preferences to use more than a single mobile application, we are adopting a brand portfolio strategy, through which we offer products that collectively appeal to the broadest spectrum of consumers. We are consolidating the fragmented mobile meeting sector through strategic acquisitions, leveraging economies and innovation to drive growth. Through this strategy of consolidation, we intend to apply a centralized discipline to learnings, best practices and technologies across our brands in order to increase growth, reduce costs and maximize profitability. On October 3, 2016, the Company completed its acquisition of Skout, a leading global mobile network for meeting new people.\nMeetMe\u2019s platforms monetize through advertising, in-app purchases, and paid subscriptions. The Company offers online marketing capabilities, which enable marketers to display their advertisements in different formats and in different locations. We offer significant scale to our advertising partners, with hundreds of millions of daily impressions across our active and growing global user base, and sophisticated data science for highly effective hyper-targeting. The Company works with its advertisers to maximize the effectiveness of their campaigns by optimizing advertisement formats and placement.\nJust as Facebook has established itself as the social network of friends and family, and LinkedIn as the social network of colleagues and business professionals, MeetMe is creating the social network not of the people you know but of the people you want to know. We believe meeting new people is a basic human need, especially for users aged 18-30, when so many long-lasting relationships are made.\n31\nWe believe that we have significant growth opportunities as people increasingly use their mobile devices to discover the people around them. Given the importance of establishing connections within a user\u2019s geographic proximity, we believe it is critical to establish a high density of users within the geographic regions we serve. As the MeetMe network grows and the number of users in a location increases, we believe that users who are seeking to meet new people will incrementally benefit from the quantity of relevant connections.\n2016 Highlights\n\u25cf\nMobile revenue was a record $70.6 million for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2016, up 55.8% from $45.3 million in the corresponding period in 2015.\n\u25cf\nNet income for 2016 was $46.3 million. Adjusted EBITDA was $29.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. For definition of Adjusted EBITDA, please refer to the Non-GAAP \u2013 Financial Measures included below in this filing.\n\u25cf\nCash and Cash Equivalents totaled $21.9 million at December 31, 2016, an increase of $2.6 million from $19.3 million at December 31, 2015.\nFactors Affecting Our Performance\nWe believe the following factors affect our performance.\n\u25cf\nNumber of MAUs and DAUs.\nWe believe our ability to grow web and mobile MAUs and DAUs affects our revenue and financial results by influencing the number of advertisements we are able to show, the value of those advertisements, and the volume of in-app purchases, as well as our expenses and capital expenditures.\n\u25cf\nUser Engagement.\nWe believe changes in user engagement patterns affect our revenue and financial performance. Specifically, the number of visits and page views each MAU or DAU generates affects the number of advertisements we are able to display and therefore the rate at which we are able to monetize our active user base. We continue to create new features and enhance existing features to drive additional engagement.\n\u25cf\nAdvertising Rates.\nWe believe our revenue and financial results are materially dependent on industry trends, and any changes to the revenue we earn per thousand advertising impressions (CPM) could affect our revenue and financial results. We expect to continue investing in new types of advertising and new placements, especially in our mobile applications. Additionally, we are prioritizing initiatives that generate revenue directly from users, including new virtual currency products and a premium subscription product, in part to reduce our dependency on advertising revenue.\n\u25cf\nUser Geography.\nThe geography of our users influences our revenue and financial results because we currently monetize users in distinct geographies at varying average rates. For example, ARPU in the U.S. and Canada is significantly higher than in Latin America. We laid the foundation for future international growth by localizing the core MeetMe service into twelve languages in addition to English. We plan to continue to invest in user growth across the world, including in geographies where current per user monetization rates are relatively lower than in the U.S. and Canada.\n\u25cf\nNew User Sources.\nThe percentage of our new users that are acquired through inorganic, paid sources impacts our financial performance, specifically with regard to ARPU for web and mobile. Inorganically acquired users tend to have lower engagement rates, tend to generate fewer visits and ad impressions and to be less likely to make in-app purchases. When paid marketing campaigns are ongoing, our overall usage and traffic increases due to the influx of inorganically acquired users, but the rate at which we monetize the average active user overall declines as a result.\n\u25cf\nAd Inventory Management.\nOur revenue trends are affected by advertisement inventory management changes affecting the number, size, or prominence of advertisements we display. In general, more prominently displayed advertising units generate more revenue per impression. Our Social Theater campaign expenses are materially dependent on the percentage of Social Theater campaigns that run on MeetMe versus the percentage that run on other networks. We work to maximize the share of Social Theater campaigns that run on MeetMe and run campaigns on other networks only when necessary.\n\u25cf\nIncreased Social Theater Competition.\nA significant portion of the revenue generated by the Social Theater is derived from advertising campaigns, powered by Social Theater technology, that run on networks other than MeetMe. A recent increase in competitors offering similar technology solutions, and in some cases their own cross-platform distribution networks, has made it more difficult to compete on price and win business. We expect this downward pressure on price to continue and impact our operating results in the future.\n\u25cf\nSeasonality.\nAdvertising spending is traditionally seasonal with a peak in the fourth quarter of each year. We believe that this seasonality in advertising spending affects our quarterly results, which generally reflect a growth in advertising revenue between the third and fourth quarters and a decline in advertising spending between the fourth and subsequent first and second quarters each year. Growth trends in web and mobile MAUs and DAUs affect our revenue and financial results by influencing the number of advertisements we are able to show, the value of those advertisements, the volume of payments transactions, as well as our expenses and capital expenditures.\n32\nGrowth trends in web and mobile MAUs and DAUs affect our revenue and financial results by influencing the number of advertisements we are able to show, the value of those advertisements, the volume of payments transactions, as well as our expenses and capital expenditures.\nChanges in user engagement patterns from web to mobile and international diversification also affect our revenue and financial performance. We believe that overall engagement as measured by the percentage of users who create content (such as status posts, messages, or photos) or generate feedback increases as our user base grows. We continue to create new and improved features to drive social sharing and increase monetization. The launch of additional languages to the platform facilitates international user growth.\nWe believe our revenue trends are also affected by advertisement inventory management changes affecting the number, size, or prominence of the advertisements we display and traditional seasonality. Social Theater is a revenue product for the MeetMe platform and on third-party sites. Social Theater growth may be affected by large brand penetration, the ability to grow the advertiser base, and advertiser spending budgets.\nThe following table sets forth our Consolidated Statements of Operations for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014 that is used in the following discussions of our results of operations.\n2016\n2015\n2014\n2015 to 2016\nChange ($)\n2015 to 2016\nChange (%)\n2014 to 2015\nChange ($)\n2014 to 2015\nChange (%)\nRevenues\n$76,124,109\n$56,903,773\n$44,817,436\n$19,220,336\n33.8%\n$12,086,337\n27.0%\nOperating Costs and Expenses.\nSales and marketing\n15,089,987\n6,618,837\n7,277,719\n8,471,150\n128.0%\n(658,882\n)\n-9.1%\nProduct development and content\n25,790,173\n24,615,304\n28,324,443\n1,174,869\n4.8%\n(3,709,139\n)\n-13.1%\nGeneral and administrative\n9,494,804\n14,534,861\n8,017,970\n(5,040,057\n)\n-34.7%\n6,516,891\n81.3%\nDepreciation and amortization\n4,069,211\n3,140,205\n4,223,507\n929,006\n29.6%\n(1,083,302\n)\n-25.6%\nAcquisition and restructuring costs\n2,457,295\n\u2014\n120,202\n2,457,295\n100.0%\n(120,202\n)\n-100.0%\nTotal Operating Costs and Expenses\n56,901,470\n48,909,207\n47,963,841\n7,992,263\n16.3%\n945,366\n2.0%\nIncome (Loss) from Operations\n19,222,639\n7,994,566\n(3,146,405\n)\n11,228,073\n140.4%\n11,140,971\n354.1%\nOther Income (Expense).\nInterest income\n21,185\n21,037\n10,352\n148\n0.7%\n10,685\n103.2%\nInterest expense\n(19,388\n)\n(459,962\n)\n(1,052,620\n)\n440,574\n-95.8%\n592,658\n-56.3%\nChange in warrant liability\n(864,596\n)\n(616,607\n)\n226,508\n(247,989\n)\n40.2%\n(843,115\n)\n-372.2%\nLoss on cumulative foreign currency translation adjustment\n\u2014\n(856,438\n)\n\u2014\n856,438\n100.0%\n(856,438\n)\n-100.0%\nGain on foreign currency adjustment\n33,416\n\u2014\n\u2014\n33,416\n100.0%\n\u2014\n\u2014%\nGain on sale of asset\n\u2014\n163,333\n\u2014\n(163,333\n)\n-100.0%\n163,333\n100.0%\nTotal Other Expense\n(829,383\n)\n(1,748,637\n)\n(815,760\n)\n919,254\n-52.6%\n(932,877\n)\n114.4%\nIncome (Loss) before Benefit (Provision) for Income Taxes\n18,393,256\n6,245,929\n(3,962,165\n)\n12,147,327\n194.5%\n10,208,094\n257.6%\nBenefit (provision) for income taxes\n27,875,362\n(276,301\n)\n\u2014\n28,151,663\n10188.8%\n(276,301\n)\n-100.0%\nNet Income (Loss)\n$46,268,618\n$5,969,628\n$(3,962,165\n)\n$40,298,990\n675.1%\n$9,931,793\n250.7%\n33\nComparison of the year ended December 31, 2016 to the year ended December 31, 2015\nRevenues\nOur revenues were $76.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2016, an increase of $19.2 million or 33.8% compared to $56.9 million for the same period in 2015. The increase is attributable to an $18.2 million increase in mobile revenue and $7.2 million of revenue from Skout, which was acquired by merger on October 3, 2016. Offsetting these revenues was a $6.2 million decrease in web advertising and cross platform revenue. The increase in mobile advertising revenue is due to growth with our mobile traffic metrics, specifically DAUs on mobile devices, and increased advertising rates on mobile devices. The decrease in web advertising revenue is attributable to the decline in web DAUs.\nOperating Costs and Expenses\nSales and Marketing.\nSales and marketing expenses increased $8.5 million, or 128.0%, to $15.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 from $6.6 million in 2015. The net increase in sales and marketing expenses, including the Skout sales and marketing related expense from the date of the acquisition, is attributable to an increase in advertising spend of $8.8 million. The acquisition of Skout brought on five full-time sales and marketing staff located in the San Francisco office.\nProduct Development and Content.\nProduct development and content expenses increased $1.2 million, or 4.8%, to $25.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 from $24.6 million in 2015. The net increase in product development and content expense, including the Skout product development related expense from the date of the acquisition, is attributable to an increase in employee expenses of $1.9 million, an increase in mobile content costs of $412,000, and\na net decrease of $1.5 million of third party content costs for cross platform Social Theater affiliate campaigns. The acquisition of Skout brought on 19 full-time product development staff located in the San Francisco office and accounted for $879,000 of increased employee expenses and $193,000 of the increased mobile content costs. The additional increase in employee expense was attributable to annual salary increases and increased benefit costs. The decrease in third party content costs for cross platform Social Theater campaigns was due to lower cross platform revenue and an improvement on cost structures for those cross platform revenue products.\nGeneral and Administrative.\nGeneral and administrative expenses decreased $5.0 million or 34.7%, to $9.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 from $14.5 million for the same period in 2015. The aggregate decrease in general and administrative costs is due to the bad debt write-off of Beanstock\u2019s outstanding receivable balance of $5.7 million in the year ended December 31, 2015, partially offset by the inclusion of Skout general and administrative related expenses of $324,000\n. The acquisition of Skout brought on two full-time general and administrative staff located in the San Francisco office.\nAcquisition and Restructuring Costs\n.\nAcquisition and restructuring costs were $2.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2016, due to professional fees and other one-time expenses incurred in connection with the Skout acquisition.\nComparison of the year ended December 31, 2015 to the year ended December 31, 2014\nRevenues\nOur revenues were $56.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2015, an increase of $12.1 million or 27.0% compared to $44.8 million for the same period in 2014. The increase in revenue is attributable to a $20.6 million increase in mobile revenue, partially offset by an $8.5 million decrease in web advertising and cross platform revenue. We believe the increase in mobile revenue is due to increased advertising rates on mobile devices, growth with our mobile traffic metrics, specifically DAUs on mobile devices and increased advertising impressions. We believe the decrease in web advertising revenue is attributable to the decline in web DAUs.\nOperating Costs and Expenses\nSales and Marketing.\nSales and marketing expenses decreased approximately $659,000, or 9.1%, to $6.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 from $7.3 million in 2014. Decreased sales and marketing expenses are primarily attributable to a decrease of $1.6 million in employee related expenses and a decrease of $221,000 in other expenses associated with the closure of the Brazil office, partially offset by an increase of $1.4 million in advertising and marketing spend.\nProduct Development and Content.\nProduct development and content expenses decreased $3.7 million, or 13.1%, to $24.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 from $28.3 million in 2014. The net decrease in product development and content expense is attributable to a net decrease of $1.7 million in technical operations expenses as a result of the consolidation of servers in our data center, $1.1 million in third party content costs for cross platform Social Theater affiliate campaigns, and a decrease in stock compensation costs of $835,000. The decrease in third party content costs for cross platform Social Theater campaigns was primarily due to lower cross platform revenue.\n34\nGeneral and Administrative.\nGeneral and administrative expenses increased $6.5 million or 81.3%, to $14.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 from $8.0 million for the same period in 2014. The aggregate increase in general and administrative costs is attributable to the $5.7 million bad debt write-off of Beanstock\u2019s outstanding receivable, and increased stock compensation expense of $498,000, primarily due to the revaluation of the warrants associated with the F. Stephen Allen settlement.\nComparison of Stock-Based Compensation and Other Costs and Expenses\nStock-Based Compensation\nStock-based compensation expense, included in operating expense by category, increased approximately $226,000 to $3.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 from $3.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2015. Stock-based compensation expense represented 6.3% and 6.8% of operating expenses for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively.\nStock-based compensation expense decreased approximately $468,000 to $3.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 from $3.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2014. Stock-based compensation expense represented 6.8% and 7.9% of operating expenses for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively.\nAs of December 31, 2016, there was $3.4 million and $3.0 million of unrecognized compensation cost related to stock options and unvested restricted stock awards, respectively, which is expected to be recognized over a period of approximately two to three years.\nFor the Years Ended December 31,\n2015 to 2016\n2014 to 2015\n2016\n2015\n2014\nChanges ($)\nChanges ($)\nSales and marketing\n$354,088\n$309,708\n$440,284\n$44,380\n$(130,576\n)\nProduct development and content\n1,528,547\n1,197,696\n2,033,009\n330,851\n(835,313\n)\nGeneral and administrative\n1,685,352\n1,409,023\n1,336,916\n276,329\n72,107\nTotal stock-based compensation for vesting of options\nand RSA's\n3,567,987\n2,916,427\n3,810,209\n651,560\n(893,782\n)\nWarrant modification\n\u2014\n425,538\n\u2014\n(425,538\n)\n425,538\nTotal stock-based compensation expense\n$3,567,987\n$3,341,965\n$3,810,209\n$226,022\n$(468,244\n)\nStock-based compensation expense is composed of the following.\nFor the Years Ended December 31,\n2016\n2015\n2014\nVesting of stock options\n$1,475,106\n$1,389,554\n$2,663,169\nVesting of restricted stock awards\n2,092,881\n1,526,873\n1,147,040\nWarrant modification\n\u2014\n425,538\n\u2014\nTotal stock-based compensation expense\n$3,567,987\n$3,341,965\n$3,810,209\nThe amortization of prepaid expenses includes compensation for professional services in which the related stock options vested prior to the performance of services. The amount of compensation is amortized over the lengths of the contracts.\nDepreciation and Amortization Expense\nDepreciation and amortization expense increased $0.9 million to $4.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 from $3.1 million in the year ended December 31, 2015. The increase in expense is primarily driven by an increase in intangible assets resulting from the Skout acquisition.\nDepreciation and amortization expense decreased $1.1 million to $3.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 from $4.2 million in the year ended December 31, 2014. The decrease in expense is primarily driven by more assets becoming fully depreciated during the year, partially offset by more equipment purchases in the current year as compared to the prior year.\n35\nAcquisition and Restructuring Costs\nFor the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, acquisition and restructuring costs were approximately $2.5 million, $0 and $120,000, respectively, including the accrual of employee exit and relocation costs, excluding the impact of stock-based compensation expense reversals associated with employee terminations resulting from the restructure.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nFor the Years Ended December 31,\n2016\n2015\n2014\nNet cash provided by operating activities\n$25,922,895\n$7,209,245\n$4,596,237\nNet cash used in investing activities\n(30,941,011\n)\n(1,514,964\n)\n(1,112,487\n)\nNet cash provided by (used in) financing activities\n7,939,271\n(3,298,640\n)\n7,296,985\n$2,921,151\n$2,395,641\n$10,780,735\nNet cash provided by operations was $25.9 million, $7.2 million and $4.6 million for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively. For the year ended December 31, 2016, net cash provided by operations consisted primarily of net income of $46.3 million adjusted for certain non-cash expenses including $28.1 million related to deferred taxes, $4.1 million of depreciation and amortization expense, $3.6 million related to stock based compensation for the vesting of stock options, $150,000 for bad debt expense and approximately $865,000 for change in warrant liability. Changes in working capital increased the net cash provided by operations. These changes included decreases in accounts receivable of $3.2 million resulting from collections, approximately $171,000 in prepaid expenses, and other current assets and other assets, and $2.6 million in accounts payable and accrued liabilities\n. For the year ended December 31, 2015, net cash provided by operations consisted primarily of net income from operations of $6.0 million adjusted for certain non-cash expenses of $3.1 million of depreciation and amortization expense, $3.3 million related to stock based compensation for the vesting of stock options, approximately $856,000 related to loss on cumulative foreign currency translation adjustment, approximately $163,000 for gain on sale of asset, and approximately $185,000 in amortization of discounts on notes payable and debt issuance costs. Additionally, changes in working capital decreased the net cash provided by operations. These changes included increases in accounts receivable of $7.0 million resulting from increased sales, offset by increases in accounts payable and accrued expenses of approximately $685,000 due to timing of vendor payments. For the year ended December 31, 2014, net cash provided by continuing operations consisted primarily of a net loss from operations of approximately $4.0 million offset by non-cash expenses of approximately $4.2 million from depreciation and amortization expense, $3.8 million related to stock-based compensation, and approximately $522,000 in amortization of discounts on notes payable and debt issuance costs.\nNet cash used in investing activities for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014 was $30.9 million, $1.5 million and $1.1 million, respectively. For the year ended December 31, 2016, net cash used in investing activities was primarily due to the Skout acquisition and capital expenditures for computer equipment to increase capacity and improve performance.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2015, net cash used in investing activities was spent on capital expenditures of $1.8 million for computer equipment to increase capacity and improve performance, offset by proceeds of $255,000 from the sale of an asset. During the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, we did not enter into any additional capital leases. For the year ended December 31, 2014, net cash used in investing activities consisted primarily of purchases of property and equipment.\nNet cash provided by (used in) financing activities in the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014 was $7.9 million, $(3.3) million and $7.3 million, respectively. For the year ended December 31, 2016, net cash provided by financing activities of $7.9 million was due to $8.8 million of proceeds from exercise of stock options and $4.5 million of proceeds from the exercise of warrants, partially offset by $5.0 million of stock repurchases and approximately $366,000 of capital lease payments\n. For the year ended December 31, 2015, net cash used in financing activities of $3.3 million was primarily spent on $2.8 million of debt payments, and approximately $873,000 of capital lease payments, offset by approximately $384,000 of proceeds from the exercise of stock options. For the year ended December 31, 2014, net cash provided by financing activities of $7.3 million was due to common stock offering proceeds of $10.6 million, offset by $2.3 million of debt payments and $1.0 million of capital lease payments.\nDecember 31, 2016\nDecember 31, 2015\nCash and cash equivalents\n$21,852,531\n$19,298,038\nTotal assets\n$209,489,484\n$111,490,673\nPercentage of total assets\n10.4%\n17.3%\n36\nOur cash balances are kept liquid to support our growing infrastructure needs for operational expansion. The majority of our cash is concentrated in two large financial institutions.\nAs of December 31, 2016 and 2015, we had positive working capital of $32.7 million and $29.2 million, respectively.\nWe entered into a Media Publisher Agreement with Beanstock Media, Inc. (\u201cBeanstock\u201d) on September 25, 2013 and an Advertising Agreement with Beanstock on December 23, 2014 (together, as amended, the \u201cBeanstock Agreements\u201d). On June 2, 2015 we terminated the Beanstock Agreements as a result of non-payment by Beanstock of amounts owed. In the third quarter of 2015, we wrote-off the accounts receivable balance under the Beanstock Agreements of $5.7 million as the amount was deemed to be uncollectible.\nOn April 29, 2013, we (i) entered into a loan and security agreement with a leading provider of debt financing to technology companies (the \u201cLoan Agreement\u201d) and (ii) issued two warrant agreements (\u201cWarrants\u201d), for the purchase of shares of our common stock to the lenders under the Loan Agreement. The Loan Agreement had an aggregate commitment of $8.0 million. We borrowed $5.0 million under the Loan Agreement on April 29, 2013. Had we achieved certain financial goals, we could have borrowed two additional tranches of loans, each in an aggregate principal amount of up to $1.5 million. All loans under the Loan Agreement had a term of 36 months and could not be re-borrowed after repayment. The lender under the Loan Agreement had a security interest in substantially all of our assets. The purchase price for the shares of common stock issuable upon exercise of the Warrants was equal to, at each Warrant holder\u2019s option, the lower of (x) $1.96 and (y) the price per share of the stock issued in the next equity placement of our stock, subject to certain restrictions set forth in the Warrants. The Warrants could have been exercised until February 28, 2024. As of December 31, 2016, we did not have any outstanding indebtedness under the Loan Agreement. The remaining warrants were exercised in 2016.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2016, we did not enter into any additional capital leases. As of December 31, 2016, capital leases that were previously entered into had approximately $221,000 in principal amount of capital lease indebtedness, all of which is due in 2017.\nWe believe that, with its current available cash, anticipated revenues and collections on its accounts receivables, and its access to capital through various financing options, it will have sufficient funds to meet its anticipated cash needs for at least the next 12 months.\nWe have budgeted capital expenditures of $2.4 million for 2017, which we believe will support our growth of domestic and international business through increased capacity, performance improvement, and expanded content.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nTo understand our financial statements, it is important to understand our critical accounting estimates. The preparation of our financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles in the U.S. requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Significant estimates and assumptions are required in the determination of business combinations, revenue recognition, accounts receivable valuation, the fair value of financial instruments, the valuation of long-lived assets, valuation of deferred tax assets, income taxes, contingencies, goodwill and intangible assets, and stock-based compensation. Some of these judgments can be subjective and complex, and, consequently, actual results may differ from these estimates. Our estimates often are based on complex judgments, probabilities and assumptions that we believe to be reasonable but that are inherently uncertain and unpredictable. For any given individual estimate or assumption made by us, there may also be other estimates or assumptions that are reasonable.\nWe consider an accounting estimate to be critical if: (1) the accounting estimate requires us to make assumptions about matters that were highly uncertain at the time the accounting estimate was made; and (2) changes in the estimate that are reasonably likely to occur from period to period, or use of different estimates that we reasonably could have used in the current period, would have a material impact on our financial condition results of operations or cash flows. Our most critical accounting estimates are described below.\nBusiness Combinations and Contingent Consideration Arrangements\nWe account for all business acquisitions at fair value and expenses acquisition costs as they are incurred. Any identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed are recognized and measured at their respective fair values on the acquisition date. If information about facts and circumstances existing as of the acquisition date is incomplete at the end of the reporting period in which a business acquisition occurs, we will report provisional amounts for the items for which the accounting is incomplete. The measurement period ends once we receive sufficient information to finalize the fair values; however, the period will not exceed one year from the acquisition date.\nIn connection with certain acquisitions, we entered into agreements to pay additional amounts in cash on the achievement of certain performance measures for up to 1 year ending after the acquisition date. We measure this contingent consideration at fair value at the acquisition date and record such contingent consideration as a liability our Consolidated Balance Sheets on the acquisition date. The fair value of each contingent consideration liability is remeasured at each reporting period with any change in fair value recognized as income or expense within operations in our consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income (loss). See Note 2 for more information on our business acquisitions.\n37\nRevenue Recognition\nWe recognize revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, delivery has occurred or services have been rendered, the purchase price is fixed or determinable and collectability is reasonably assured. We earn revenue from the display of advertisements on our mobile apps and website, primarily based on a cost per thousand (\u201cCPM\u201d) model. We recognize revenue in accordance with ASC 605, \u201c\nRevenue Recognition\n,\u201d and ASC 605-45 \u201c\nPrincipal Agent Considerations\u201d\n(together, \u201cthe ASC Guidance\u201d). Revenue from advertising on our mobile apps and website is generally recognized on a net basis, since the majority of our advertising revenues come from advertising agencies. The ASC guidance provides indicators for determining whether \u201cgross\u201d or \u201cnet\u201d presentation is appropriate. While all indicators should be considered, we believe that whether we acted as a primary obligor in our agreements with advertising agencies is the strongest indicator of whether gross or net revenue reporting is appropriate.\nDuring the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, we had transactions with several partners that qualify for principal agent considerations. We recognize revenue, net of amounts retained by third party entities, pursuant to revenue sharing agreements with advertising networks for advertising and with other partners for royalties on product sales. We considered two key factors when making our revenue recognition determinations: (1) whether we performed a service for a fee, similar to an agent or a broker; and (2) whether we were involved in the determination of product or service specifications. We focused on the substance of the agreements and determined that net presentation was representationally faithful to the substance, as well as the form of the agreements. The form of the agreements was such that we provided services in exchange for a fee. In addition, we have no latitude in establishing price, and the advertising agencies were solely responsible for determining pricing with third party advertisers. We determined only the fee for providing its services to advertising agencies.\nIn instances in which we work directly with an advertiser, revenue is recognized on a gross basis. We are the primary obligor in arrangements made with direct advertisers, as there is no third party facilitating or managing the sales process. We are solely responsible for determining price, product or service specifications, and which advertisers to use. We assume all credit risk in the sales arrangements made with direct advertisers.\nRefer to Note 1 of our consolidated financial statements for consideration of the agreement in which Beanstock had the right and obligation during 2015 and 2014 to fill substantially all of our advertising inventory on its MeetMe mobile app for iOS and Android, as well as the meetme.com website when accessed using a mobile device and as optimized for mobile devices.\nAccounts Receivable and Allowance for Doubtful Accounts\nWe extend credit on a non-collateralized basis to both domestic and international customers. We extend credit to customers in the normal course of business and maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts resulting from the inability or unwillingness of customers to make required payments. Management determines the allowance for doubtful accounts by evaluating individual customer receivables and considering a customer\u2019s financial condition, credit history, and current economic conditions. We prepare an analysis of our ability to collect outstanding receivables that provides a basis for an allowance estimate for doubtful accounts.\nBased on this evaluation, we maintain an allowance for potential credit losses and for potential discounts based on historical experience and other information available to management. Discounts historically represent less than 1% of the related revenues. The fees associated with display advertising are often based on \u201cimpressions,\u201d which are created when the ad is loaded. The amount of impressions often differs between non-standardized tracking systems, resulting in discounts on some payments. Differences between ad serving platforms with respect to impressions is primarily due to lag time between serving of advertising and other technical differences.\nBalance at\nBeginning of\nPeriod\nAdditions,\nCosts and\nExpenses\nDeductions,\nWrite-Offs\nBalance at\nEnd of the\nPeriod\nAllowance for Doubtful Accounts.\nYear Ended December 31, 2016\n$133,000\n$152,587\n$2,587\n$283,000\nYear Ended December 31, 2015\n$586,000\n$181,398\n$634,398\n$133,000\nYear Ended December 31, 2014\n$495,000\n$367,000\n$276,000\n$586,000\nFair Value Measurements\nThe fair values of our financial instruments reflect the amounts that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date (exit price).\nThe carrying amounts of our financial instruments of cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash, accounts receivable, accounts payable, accrued liabilities and deferred revenue approximate fair value due to their short maturities. Certain common stock warrants were carried at fair value as disclosed in Note 3 of our consolidated financial statements. We have evaluated the estimated fair value of financial instruments using available market information and management\u2019s estimates. The use of different market assumptions and\/or estimation methodologies could have a significant effect on the estimated fair value amounts.\n38\nIncome Taxes\nWe account for income taxes under the asset and liability method, which requires the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of events that have been included in the consolidated financial statements. Under this method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the differences between the financial statements and tax basis of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse. The effect of a change in tax rates on deferred tax assets and liabilities is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date.\nWe record deferred tax assets to the extent we believe these assets will more likely than not be realized. In making such determination, we consider all available positive and negative evidence, including scheduled reversals of deferred tax liabilities, projected future taxable income, tax planning strategies, and recent financial operations. In the event we determine that we would not be able to realize our deferred income tax assets in the future in excess of our net recorded amount, we would make an adjustment to the valuation allowance, which would increase the provision for income taxes.\nOur income tax returns are periodically audited by U.S. federal, state, and local and foreign tax authorities. These audits include questions regarding our tax filing positions, including the timing and amount of deductions and the allocation of income among various tax jurisdictions. At any one time, multiple tax years are subject to audit by the various tax authorities. In evaluating the tax benefits associated with our various tax filing positions, we record a tax benefit for uncertain tax positions using the highest cumulative tax benefit that is more likely than not to be realized. A number of years may elapse before a particular matter, for which a liability has been established, is audited and effectively settled. We adjust our liability for unrecognized tax benefits in the period in which we determine the issue is effectively settled with the tax authorities, the statute of limitations expires for the relevant taxing authority to examine the tax position or when more information becomes available.\nGoodwill\nGoodwill reflects the cost of an acquisition in excess of the fair values assigned to the identifiable net assets acquired. Goodwill is not amortized; rather, it is subject to a periodic assessment for impairment by applying a fair value based test. We perform our annual impairment test in conjunction with preparing our fourth quarter financial results immediately following the end of the calendar year, or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the asset might be impaired. Goodwill is tested for impairment at a level of reporting referred to as a reporting unit. We have determined that there are two reporting units, MeetMe, Inc. and Skout, LLC.\nRelated to the Skout, LLC acquisition, accounting for acquisitions requires us to recognize, separately from goodwill, the assets acquired and the liabilities assumed at their acquisition-date fair values. Goodwill as of the acquisition date is measured as the excess of consideration transferred and the net of the acquisition-date fair values of the assets acquired and the liabilities assumed. While we use best estimates and assumptions to accurately value assets acquired and liabilities assumed at the acquisition date, the estimates are inherently uncertain and subject to refinement.\nThe impairment model permits, and we utilize, a two-step method for determining goodwill impairment. In the first step, we evaluate the recoverability of goodwill by estimating the fair value of our reporting unit using multiple techniques, including an income approach using a discounted cash flow model and a market approach. Based on an equal weighting of the results of these two approaches, a conclusion of fair value is estimated. The fair value is then compared to the carrying value of our reporting unit. If the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value, we perform a second step for that reporting unit to determine the amount of impairment loss, if any. The second step requires allocation of the reporting unit\u2019s fair value to all of its assets and liabilities using the acquisition method prescribed under authoritative guidance for business combinations. Any residual fair value is allocated to goodwill. Impairment losses, limited to the carrying value of goodwill, represent the excess of the carrying amount of goodwill over its implied fair value.\nDerivatives\nAll derivatives held by us are recognized in the consolidated balance sheets at fair value. We issued warrants on our own common stock in conjunction with the term loan discussed in Note 7 of our consolidated financial statements. These warrants meet the definition of a derivative and are reflected as a warrant liability at fair value in the consolidated balance sheets.\n39\nStock-Based Compensation\nThe fair value of share-based payments is estimated on the grant date using the Black-Scholes option pricing model, based on weighted average assumptions. Expected volatility is based on historical volatility of our common stock. We elected to use the simplified method described in the Securities and Exchange Commission Staff Accounting Bulletin Topic 14C to estimate the expected term of employee stock options. The risk-free rate is based on the U.S. Treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant. Compensation expense is recognized on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period of the award.\nContingencies\nWe accrue for contingent obligations, including legal costs and restructuring costs, when the obligation is probable and the amount can be reasonably estimated. As facts concerning contingencies become known, we reassess our position and make appropriate adjustments to the consolidated financial statements. Estimates that are particularly sensitive to future changes include those related to tax, legal, and other regulatory matters that are subject to change as events evolve and additional information becomes available.\nOperating Expenses\nOur principal operating expenses are divided into the following categories.\n\u25cf\nSales and Marketing.\nOur sales and marketing expenses consist primarily of salaries, benefits, and non-cash share-based compensation for our employees engaged in sales, sales support, and marketing.\n\u25cf\nProduct Development and Content.\nOur product development and content expenses including costs incurred in the classification and organization of listings within our websites, including salaries, benefits, and non-cash share-based compensation for our employees, utility charges, occupancy and support for our offsite technology infrastructure, bandwidth and content delivery fees, and development and maintenance costs, are charged to expense as incurred.\n\u25cf\nGeneral and Administrative.\nOur general and administrative expenses consist primarily of salaries, benefits, and non-cash share-based compensation for our executives as well as our finance, legal, human resources, and other administrative employees. In addition, our general and administrative expenses include outside consulting, legal and accounting services, and facilities and other supporting overhead costs.\n\u25cf\nDepreciation and Amortization.\nOur depreciation and amortization are non-cash expenses which have consisted primarily of depreciation and amortization related to our property and equipment, and intangible assets. Currently, the amortization expense is attributable to intangible assets associated with the acquisition of myYearbook and Skout.\n\u25cf\nAcquisition and Restructuring Costs.\nAcquisition costs include the fees for broker commissions, investment banking, legal, accounting and other professional services, proxy, printing and filing costs, and travel costs incurred by us during the acquisition process. Restructuring costs include costs incurred related to our business acquisitions and costs incurred in conjunction with the restructuring of our business processes. Restructuring costs include employee termination and relocation costs recorded as incurred.\n\u25cf\nOther Income (Expense).\nOther income (expense) consists primarily of interest earned and interest expense. We have invested our cash in AAA rated, fully liquid instruments. Interest expense relates to our Loan and Notes Payable discussed in Note 7 of our consolidated financial statements.\n40\nContractual Obligations\nOur principal commitments consist of obligations for capital and operating leases. The following table summarizes our commitments to settle contractual obligations in cash as of December 31, 2016.\nTotal\nLess Than 1\nYear\n1-3 Years\n3-5 Years\nMore than 5\nYears\nCapital Lease Obligations (1)\n$225,879\n$225,879\n$\u2014\n$\u2014\n$\u2014\nOperating Lease Obligations (2)\n4,514,430\n2,370,608\n1,153,070\n878,499\n112,253\nTotal\n$4,740,309\n$2,596,487\n$1,153,070\n$878,499\n$112,253\n(1) The Capital Lease Obligations relates to equipment lease agreements for equipment primarily used in our data centers.\n(2) The Operating Lease Obligations relates to equipment and facilities we lease in the U.S.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nAs of December 31, 2016, we did not have any relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partners, such as entities often referred to as structured finance or special purpose entities, established for the purpose of facilitating off-balance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes. As such, we are not materially exposed to any financing, liquidity, market or credit risk that could arise if we had engaged in such relationships.\nNon-GAAP \u2013 Financial Measure\nThe following discussion and analysis includes both financial measures in accordance with GAAP, as well as adjusted EBITDA, which is a non-GAAP financial measure. Generally, a non-GAAP financial measure is a numerical measure of a company\u2019s performance, financial position or cash flows that either excludes or includes amounts that are not normally included or excluded in the most directly comparable measure calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP. Non-GAAP financial measures should be viewed as supplemental to, and should not be considered as alternatives to, net income, operating income, and cash flow from operating activities, liquidity or any other financial measures. They may not be indicative of our historical operating results nor are they intended to be predictive of potential future results. Investors should not consider non-GAAP financial measures in isolation or as substitutes for performance measures calculated in accordance with GAAP.\nWe believe that both management and stockholders benefit from referring to adjusted EBITDA in planning, forecasting, and analyzing future periods. We use this non-GAAP financial measure in evaluating our financial and operational decision making and as a means to evaluate period-to-period comparison.\nWe define Adjusted EBITDA as earnings (or loss) from operations before interest expense, benefit or provision for income taxes, depreciation and amortization, stock-based compensation, warrant obligations, nonrecurring acquisition, restructuring or other expenses, gain or loss on cumulative foreign currency translation adjustment, gain on sale of asset, bad debt expense outside the normal range, and goodwill and long-lived asset impairment charges, if any. We exclude stock-based compensation because it is non-cash in nature. We believe Adjusted EBITDA is an important measure of our operating performance because it allows management, investors, and analysts to evaluate and assess our core operating results from period to period after removing the impact of acquisition related costs, and other items of a non-operational nature that affect comparability. We recognize that Adjusted EBITDA has inherent limitations because of the excluded items.\n41\nWe have included a reconciliation of our Net Income (Loss), which is the most comparable financial measure calculated in accordance with GAAP, to adjusted EBITDA\n. We believe that providing this non-GAAP financial measure, together with the reconciliation from GAAP, helps investors make comparisons between us and other companies. In making any comparisons to other companies, investors need to be aware that companies use different non-GAAP measures to evaluate their financial performance. Investors should pay close attention to the specific definition being used and to the reconciliation between such measure and the corresponding GAAP measure provided by each company under applicable SEC rules.\nThe following table presents a reconciliation of Net Income (Loss), a GAAP financial measure, to Adjusted EBITDA.\nFor the Years Ended December 31,\n2016\n2015\n2014\nNet income (loss)\n$46,268,618\n$5,969,628\n$(3,962,165\n)\nInterest expense\n19,388\n459,962\n1,052,620\nChange in warrant liability\n864,596\n616,607\n(226,508\n)\n(Benefit) provision for income taxes\n(27,875,362\n)\n276,301\n\u2014\nDepreciation and amortization\n4,069,211\n3,140,205\n4,223,507\nStock-based compensation expense\n3,567,987\n3,341,965\n3,810,209\nAcquisition and restructuring costs\n2,457,295\n\u2014\n120,202\nBad debt expense outside normal range\n\u2014\n5,735,204\n\u2014\nLoss on cumulative effect of foreign currency translation adjustment\n\u2014\n856,438\n\u2014\nGain on effect of foreign currency adjustment\n(33,416\n)\n\u2014\n\u2014\nGain on sale of asset\n\u2014\n(163,333\n)\n\u2014\nAdjusted EBITDA\n$29,338,317\n$20,232,977\n$5,017,865\n42\nRecently Issued Accounting Standards\nIn May 2014, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update (\u201cASU\u201d) 2014-09,\nRevenue from Contracts with Customers.\nASU 2014-09 supersedes the revenue recognition requirements of FASB ASC Topic 605,\nRevenue Recognition\nand most industry-specific guidance throughout the ASC, resulting in the creation of FASB ASC Topic 606,\nRevenue from Contracts with Customers\n. ASU 2014-09 requires entities to recognize revenue in a way that depicts the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled to in exchange for those goods or services. This ASU provides alternative methods of adoption. In August 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-14,\nRevenue from Contracts with Customers, Deferral of the Effective Date\n. ASU 2015-14 defers the effective date of ASU 2014-09 to annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017 and interim periods within those reporting periods beginning after that date, and permits early adoption of the standard, but not before the original effective date for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2016. In March 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-08,\nRevenue from Contracts with Customers, Principal versus Agent Considerations (Reporting Revenue Gross versus Net)\nclarifying the implementation guidance on principal versus agent considerations. Specifically, an entity is required to determine whether the nature of a promise is to provide the specified good or service itself (that is, the entity is a principal) or to arrange for the good or service to be provided to the customer by the other party (that is, the entity is an agent). The determination influences the timing and amount of revenue recognition. In April 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-10,\nRevenue from Contracts with Customers, Identifying Performance Obligations and Licensing\nclarifying the implementation guidance on identifying performance obligations and licensing. Specifically, the amendments reduce the cost and complexity of identifying promised goods or services and improves the guidance for determining whether promises are separately identifiable. The amendments also provide implementation guidance on determining whether an entity's promise to grant a license provides a customer with either a right to use the entity's intellectual property (which is satisfied at a point in time) or a right to access the entity's intellectual property (which is satisfied over time). The effective date and transition requirements for ASU 2016-08 and ASU 2016-10 are the same as the effective date and transition requirements for ASU 2014-09. In May, 2016 the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-12\nRevenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606): Narrow-Scope Improvements and Practical Expedients\n, which clarifies guidance in certain narrow areas and adds a practical expedient for certain aspects of the guidance. The amendments do not change the core principle of the guidance in ASU 2014-09. In July 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-14, which delayed the effective date of ASU 2014-09. As a result, this guidance will be effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017, including interim periods within that reporting period. Earlier application is permitted only as of annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2016, including interim reporting periods within that reporting period. Management is still evaluating disclosure requirements under the new standard and will continue to evaluate the standard as well as additional changes, modifications or interpretations which may impact current conclusions. We have engaged\na third-party to assist in the assessment and implementation of this standard. We are beginning to assess the impact that these standards will have on our financial position and results of operations. Management expects to adopt the new standard using the modified retrospective method.\nIn June 2014, the FASB issued ASU No. 2014-12,\nCompensation-Stock Compensation (Topic 718): Accounting for Share-Based Payments When the Terms of an Award Provide That a Performance Target Could Be Achieved after the Requisite Service Period\n. ASU 2014-12 requires that a performance target that affects vesting, and that could be achieved after the requisite service period, be treated as a performance condition. As such, the performance target should not be reflected in estimating the grant date fair value of the award. This update further clarifies that compensation cost should be recognized in the period in which it becomes probable that the performance target will be achieved and should represent the compensation cost attributable to the period(s) for which the requisite service has already been rendered. ASU 2014-12 is effective for annual periods and interim periods within those annual periods beginning after December 15, 2015. The adoption of ASU 2014-12 had no material impact on our consolidated financial statements.\nIn August 2014, the FASB issued ASU 2014-15,\nPresentation of Financial Statements \u2013 Going Concern (Subtopic 205-40): Disclosure of Uncertainties about an Entity\u2019s Ability to Continue as a Going Concern\n. ASU 2014-15 explicitly requires management to evaluate, at each annual or interim reporting period, whether there are conditions or events that exist which raise substantial doubt about an entity\u2019s ability to continue as a going concern and to provide related disclosures. ASU 2014-15 is effective for annual periods ending after December 15, 2016, and annual and interim periods thereafter, with early adoption permitted. We are currently evaluating the impact of adopting this new standard on our consolidated financial statement disclosures.\n43\nIn April 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-03\n, Interest \u2013 Imputation of Interest (Subtopic 835-30): Simplifying the Presentation of Debt Issuance Costs\n. The new standard requires debt issuance costs, related to a recognized debt liability, be presented in the balance sheet as a direct deduction from the carrying amount of the related debt liability instead of being presented as an asset. The update requires the guidance to be applied retrospectively. The update is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2015. The adoption of ASU 2015-03 had no material impact on our consolidated financial statements.\nIn November 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-17,\nBalance Sheet Classification of Deferred Taxes\n, which will require entities to present all deferred tax assets (\u201cDTAs\u201d) and deferred tax liabilities (\u201cDTLs\u201d) as non-current on the balance sheet. This guidance is effective for public companies for annual periods, and interim periods within those annual periods, beginning after December 15, 2016. Early adoption is permitted, and entities may choose whether to adopt this update prospectively or retrospectively. On December 31, 2015, we elected to adopt ASU 2015-17 and changed our method of classifying DTAs and DTLs as either current or non-current to classifying all DTAs and DTLs as non-current, using a prospective method. Prior balance sheets were not retrospectively adjusted. The adoption did not have a material effect on our financial position.\nIn January 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-01,\nFinancial Instruments - Overall: Recognition and Measurement of Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities\n. ASU 2016-01 modifies how entities measure equity investments and present changes in the fair value of financial liabilities. Under the new guidance, entities will have to measure equity investments that do not result in consolidation and are not accounted under the equity method at fair value and recognize any changes in fair value in net income unless the investments qualify for the new practicality exception. A practicality exception will apply to those equity investments that do not have a readily determinable fair value and do not qualify for the practical expedient to estimate fair value under ASC 820,\nFair Value Measurements\n, and as such these investments may be measured at cost. ASU 2016-01 will be effective for annual periods and interim periods within those annual periods beginning after December 15, 2017 and early adoption is not permitted. The adoption of ASU 2016-01 is not expected to have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements.\nIn February 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-02,\nLeases\n(Topic 842). The new standard establishes a right-of-use (ROU) model that requires a lessee to record an ROU asset and a lease liability on the balance sheet for all leases with terms longer than 12 months. Leases will be classified as either finance or operating, with classification affecting the pattern of expense recognition in the income statement. ASU 2016-02 is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2018, and annual and interim periods thereafter, with early adoption permitted. A modified retrospective transition approach is required for lessees for capital and operating leases existing at, or entered into after, the beginning of the earliest comparative period presented in the financial statements, with certain practical expedients available. We are currently evaluating the impact that the adoption of this new standard will have on our consolidated financial statements.\nIn March 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-09,\nCompensation - Stock Compensation (Topic 718)\n. The amendments of ASU No. 2016-09 were issued as part of the FASB's Simplification Initiative focused on improving areas of GAAP for which cost and complexity may be reduced while maintaining or improving the usefulness of information disclosed within the financial statements. The amendments focused on simplification specifically with regard to share-based payment transactions, including income tax consequences, classification of awards as equity or liabilities and classification on the statement of cash flows. The guidance in ASU No. 2016-09 is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2016, and interim periods within those annual periods. Early adoption is permitted. The adoption of ASU 2016-09\nhad a $3.2 million tax benefit on the Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Income (Loss) and increased the deferred tax asset by the same amount on the Consolidated Balance Sheet.\nIn June 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-13,\nFinancial Instruments - Credit Losses (Topic 326): Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments\n. The standard provides for a new impairment model which requires measurement and recognition of expected credit losses for most financial assets held. ASU No. 2016-13 is effective for public companies for annual periods, and interim periods within those annual periods, beginning after December 15, 2019. We are currently evaluating the impact that the adoption of this new standard will have on our consolidated financial statements.\nIn August 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-15,\nStatement of Cash Flows (Topic 230): Classification of Certain Cash Receipts and Cash Payments\n, providing additional guidance on several cash flow classification issues, with the goal of the update to reduce the current and potential future diversity in practice. The amendments in this update are effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017, and interim periods within those fiscal years. We are currently evaluating the impact that the adoption of this new standard will have on the consolidated financial statements.\nIn November 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-18\n, Statement of Cash Flows (Topic 230): Restricted Cash\n, which amended the existing accounting standards for the statement of cash flows by requiring restricted cash to be included with cash and cash equivalents when reconciling the beginning-of-period and end-of-period total amounts shown on the statement of cash flows. ASU 2016-18 will be effective in fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017, including interim periods within those fiscal years, and early adoption is permitted. The amendments should be applied retrospectively to all periods presented. We have elected to early adopt this new standard and it will be applied retrospectively to all periods presented.\n44\nIn January 2017, the FASB issued ASU No. 2017-01,\nBusiness Combinations (Topic 805): Clarifying the Definition of a\nBusiness\n. The amendments of ASU No. 2017-01 provide guidance, including an enhanced framework, to assist with evaluating whether transactions should be accounted for as acquisitions (or disposals) of assets or businesses. The amendments in this update are effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017, and interim periods within those fiscal years. We believe the adoption of this new standard will have no material impact on our consolidated financial statements and plan to apply its provisions prospectively.\nIn January 2017, the FASB issued ASU\n2017-04\n\u201cIntangibles \u2013 Goodwill and Other (Topic 350): Simplifying the Test for Goodwill Impairment.\n\u201d\nThe Board is issuing the amendments in this update to simplify the subsequent measurement of goodwill by eliminating Step 2 from the goodwill impairment test. Instead, an entity should perform its goodwill impairment test by comparing the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying amount. An entity should recognize an impairment charge for the amount by which the carrying amount exceeds the reporting unit\u2019s fair value; however, the loss recognized should not exceed the total amount of goodwill allocated to that reporting unit. We are required to apply the amendments in this for its annual or any interim goodwill impairment tests in fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2019. We have evaluated this standard and believe that it will not have a material impact on our consolidated financial position or results of operation.\nItem 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK\nThe primary objective of our investment activities is to preserve principal while at the same time maximizing yields without significantly increasing risk. Our cash balance as of December 31, 2016 was held in insured depository accounts, of which $20.6 million exceeded insurance limits.","71":"ITEM 7.\nMANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nThe following discussion is intended to assist in understanding the financial condition and results of operations of the Company. The information contained in this section should be read with the\nDecember 31, 2016\naudited Consolidated Financial Statements and Notes thereto included in \"Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\" of this Form 10-K.\nCritical Accounting Policies\nThe Company\u2019s Consolidated Financial Statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.  Companies may apply certain critical accounting policies requiring management to make subjective or complex judgments, often as a result of the need to estimate the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain.\nThe Company considers its most critical accounting estimates to be the allowance for loan losses, estimations of expected cash flows related to purchased credit impaired loans, business combinations, other than temporary impairments in the market value of investments and consideration of potential impairment of goodwill.\nAllowance for Loan Losses\nThe allowance for loan losses is established through a provision for loan losses charged against earnings. The balance of the allowance for loan losses is maintained at the amount management believes will be appropriate to absorb probable incurred losses in the loan portfolio at the balance sheet date. The allowance for loan losses is determined by applying estimated loss factors to the credit exposure from outstanding loans.\nWe assess the estimated credit losses inherent in our loan portfolio by considering a number of elements including.\n\u2022\nhistorical loss experience in the loan portfolio;\n\u2022\nbalance of potential problem loans in the loan portfolio;\n\u2022\nimpact of environmental factors, including.\n\u25e6\nlevels of and trends in delinquencies and impaired loans;\n\u25e6\nlevels of and trends in charge-offs and recoveries;\n29\nTable of Contents\n\u25e6\ntrends in volume and terms of loans;\n\u25e6\neffects of changes in risk selection and underwriting standards, and other changes in lending policies, procedures and practices;\n\u25e6\nexperience, ability, and depth of lending management and other relevant staff;\n\u25e6\nnational and local economic trends and conditions;\n\u25e6\nother external factors such as competition, legal, and regulatory;\n\u25e6\neffects of changes in credit concentrations; and\n\u25e6\nother factors\nWe calculate an appropriate allowance for loan losses for the loans in our loan portfolio by applying historical loss factors for homogeneous classes of the portfolio, adjusted for changes to the above-noted environmental factors. We may record specific provisions for impaired loans, including loans on nonaccrual status and troubled-debt restructured (\"TDR\") loans, after a careful analysis of each loan\u2019s credit and collateral factors. Our analysis of an appropriate allowance for loan losses combines the provisions made for our non-impaired loans and the specific provisions made for each impaired loan.\nWhile we believe we use the best information available to determine the allowance for loan losses, our results of operations could be significantly affected if circumstances differ substantially from the assumptions used in determining the allowance. A decline in national and local economic conditions, or other factors, could result in a material increase in the allowance for loan losses and may adversely affect the Company\u2019s financial condition and results of operations. In addition, the determination of the amount of the allowance for loan losses is subject to review by bank regulators, as part of their routine examination process, which may result in the establishment of additional allowance for loan losses based upon their judgment of information available to them at the time of their examination.\nFor additional information regarding the allowance for loan losses, its relation to the provision for loan losses, risk related to asset quality and lending activity, see \u201c\u2014Results of Operations for the Years Ended\nDecember 31, 2016\nand 2015\u2014Provision for Loan Losses\u201d and \u201c\u2014Consolidated Financial Condition \u2014Allowance for Loan Losses\u201d below, \u201cItem 1A. Risk Factors \u2014Our allowance for loan losses may prove to be insufficient to absorb losses in our loan portfolio\u201d as well as Note (5) Allowance for Loan Losses of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in \u201cItem 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.\u201d\nEstimated Expected Cash Flows related to Purchased Credit Impaired (\"PCI\") Loans\nLoans purchased with evidence of credit deterioration since origination for which it is probable that all contractually required payments will not be collected are accounted for under FASB ASC 310-30,\nLoans and Debt Securities Acquired with Deteriorated Credit Quality.\nIn situations where such PCI loans have similar risk characteristics, loans may be aggregated into pools to estimate cash flows.  A pool is accounted for as a single asset with a single interest rate, cumulative loss rate and cash flow expectation.\nThe cash flows expected over the life of the PCI loan or pool are estimated using an internal cash flow model that projects cash flows and calculates the carrying values of the pools, book yields, effective interest income and impairment, if any, based on pool level events. Assumptions as to default rates, loss severity and prepayment speeds are utilized to calculate the expected cash flows.\nExpected cash flows at the acquisition date in excess of the fair value of loans are considered to be accretable yield, which is recognized as interest income over the life of the loan or pool using a level yield method if the timing and amounts of the future cash flows of the pool are reasonably estimable. Subsequent to the acquisition date, any increases in cash flow over those expected at purchase date in excess of fair value are recorded as interest income prospectively. Any subsequent decreases in cash flow over those expected at purchase date are recognized by recording an allowance for loan losses. Any disposals of loans, including sales of loans, payments in full or foreclosures result in the removal of the loan from the loan pool at the carrying amount.\nBusiness Combinations\nThe Company applies the acquisition method of accounting for business combinations. Under the acquisition method, the acquiring entity in a business combination recognizes all of the identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed at their acquisition date fair values. Management utilizes prevailing valuation techniques appropriate for the asset or liability being measured in determining these fair values. Any excess of the purchase price over amounts allocated to assets acquired, including identifiable intangible assets, and liabilities assumed is recorded as goodwill. Where amounts allocated to assets acquired and liabilities assumed is greater than the purchase price, a bargain purchase gain is recognized. Acquisition-related costs are expensed as incurred unless they are directly attributable to the issuance of the Company's common stock in a business combination.\n30\nTable of Contents\nOther-Than-Temporary Impairments in the Market Value of Investments\nUnrealized losses on investment securities available for sale and held to maturity are evaluated at least quarterly to determine whether declines in value should be considered \u201cother than temporary\u201d and therefore be subject to immediate loss recognition in income. Although these evaluations involve significant judgment, an unrealized loss in the fair value of a debt security is generally deemed to be temporary when the fair value of the security is below the carrying value primarily due to changes in interest rates, there has not been significant deterioration in the financial condition of the issuer, and it is not more likely than not that the Company will be required to sell the security before the anticipated recovery of its remaining carrying value.  An unrealized loss in the value of an equity security is generally considered temporary when the fair value of the security is below the carrying value primarily due to current market conditions and not deterioration in the financial condition of the issuer and it is not more likely than not that the Company will be required to sell the security before the anticipated recovery of its remaining carrying value. Other factors that may be considered in determining whether a decline in the value of either a debt or an equity security is \u201cother than temporary\u201d include ratings by recognized rating agencies; actions of commercial banks or other lenders relative to the continued extension of credit facilities to the issuer of the security; the financial condition, capital strength and near-term prospects of the issuer and recommendations of investment advisors or market analysts. Therefore, continued deterioration of market conditions could result in additional impairment losses recognized within the investment portfolio.\nGoodwill\nThe Company\u2019s goodwill is assigned to Heritage Bank and is evaluated for impairment at the Heritage Bank level (reporting unit). Goodwill is reviewed for impairment annually and between annual tests if an event occurs or circumstances change that might indicate the Company\u2019s recorded value is more than its implied value. Such indicators may include, among others: a significant adverse change in legal factors or in the general business climate; significant decline in the Company\u2019s stock price and market capitalization; unanticipated competition; and an adverse action or assessment by a regulator. Any adverse changes in these factors could have a significant impact on the recoverability of goodwill and could have a material impact on the Company\u2019s Consolidated Financial Statements.\nThe testing for impairment may begin with an assessment of qualitative factors to determine whether the existence of events or circumstances leads to a determination that the fair value of goodwill is less than carrying value. The qualitative assessment includes adverse events or circumstances identified that could negatively affect the reporting unit's fair value as well as positive and mitigating events.  When required, the goodwill impairment test involves a two-step process. The first test for goodwill impairment is done by comparing the reporting unit\u2019s aggregate fair value to its carrying value. Absent other indicators of impairment, if the aggregate fair value exceeds the carrying value, goodwill is not considered impaired and no additional analysis is necessary. If the carrying value of the reporting unit were to exceed the aggregate fair value, a second test would be performed to measure the amount of impairment loss, if any. To measure any impairment loss the implied fair value would be determined in the same manner as if the reporting unit were being acquired in a business combination. If the implied fair value of goodwill is less than the recorded goodwill an impairment charge would be recorded for the difference.\nFor the year ended\nDecember 31, 2016\n, the Company completed step one of the two-step process of the goodwill impairment test.  Based on the results of the test, the Company concluded that the reporting unit\u2019s fair value was greater than its carrying value and there was no impairment of goodwill.\nFor additional information regarding goodwill, see Note (9) Goodwill and other intangible assets of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in \u201cItem 8.

It is designed primarily to provide and maintain liquidity, generate a favorable return on investments without incurring undue interest rate and credit risk, and complements the Bank's lending activities.  The policy dictates the criteria for classifying securities as either available for sale or held to maturity. The policy permits investment in various types of liquid assets permissible under applicable regulations, which include U.S. Treasury obligations, U.S. Government agency obligations, some certificates of deposit of insured banks, mortgage backed and mortgage related securities, corporate notes, municipal bonds, and federal funds.  Investment in non-investment grade bonds and stripped mortgage-backed securities is not permitted under the policy.\nInvestment securities available for sale decreased\n$17.2 million\n, or\n2.1%\n, to\n$794.6 million\nat\nDecember 31, 2016\nfrom\n$811.9 million\nat\nDecember 31, 2015\n.

During the year ended\nDecember 31, 2016\n, there were additions to nonaccrual loans of $9.2 million, of which $1.6 million were previously performing TDR loans that were transferred to nonaccrual status. The increase in total nonaccrual loans at\nDecember 31, 2016\nwas partially offset by net principal payments of $6.2 million, nonaccrual loans transferred to other real estate owned of $523,000 and net charge-offs of $1.0 million.  Nonaccrual loans with no related allowance for loan losses was $6.3 million and $1.9 million at December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively.  Nonaccrual loans totaling $4.6 million at December 31, 2016 had a related allowance for loan losses of $770,000 compared to nonaccrual loans of $7.7 million with related allowance for loan losses of $1.2 million at December 31, 2015.\nTroubled Debt Restructured (\"TDR\") Loans\n.  TDR loans are considered impaired and are separately measured for impairment whether on accrual or nonaccrual status.  At\nDecember 31, 2016\n, nonperforming TDR loans included in the nonaccrual loan balance was\n$6.9 million\nand had a related allowance for loan losses of\n$437,000\n.  At\nDecember 31, 2015\n, nonperforming TDR loans of\n$6.3 million\nhad a related allowance for loan losses of\n$679,000.\nThe performing TDR loans are not considered nonperforming assets as they continue to accrue interest despite being considered impaired due to the restructured status. Performing TDR loans as of\nDecember 31, 2016\nand\nDecember 31, 2015\nwere\n$22.3 million\nand\n$20.7 million\n, respectively. The\n$1.6 million\nincrease in performing TDR loans during the year ended December 31,\n2016\nwas primarily due to loans restructured during the year ended\nDecember 31, 2016\nof $5.9 million, offset partially by net principal reductions of $2.4 million, loans transferred to nonaccrual status of $1.6 million and net charge-offs of $286,000. The related allowance for loan losses on the performing TDR loans was\n$2.0 million\nas of\nDecember 31, 2016\nand\n$2.1 million\nas of\nDecember 31, 2015.\nPotential Problem Loans\n.    Potential problem loans are those loans that are currently accruing interest and are not considered impaired, but which we are monitoring because the financial information of the borrower causes us concerns as to their ability to comply with their loan repayment terms.  Loans that are past due 90 days or more and still accruing interest are those that are both well-secured and in the process of collection. Potential problem loans decreased\n$22.6 million\n, or\n20.5%\n, to\n$87.8 million\nat\nDecember 31, 2016\nfrom\n$110.4 million\nat\nDecember 31, 2015\nprimarily due to net loan payments of $31.2 million, upgrade of potential problem loans to pass rated loans of $15.2 million, potential problem loans transferred to impaired status of $8.9 million and net charge-offs of $1.9 million, offset partially by loan downgrades to potential problem loans of $35.4 million during the year ended December 31, 2016.\n38\nTable of Contents\nAllowance for Loan Losses\nThe following table provides information regarding changes in our allowance for loan losses at and for the indicated years.\nAt or For the Years Ended December 31,\n2016\n2015\n2014\n2013\n2012\n(Dollars in thousands)\nAllowance for loan losses at beginning of the year\n$29,746\n$27,729\n$28,824\n$28,594\n$30,915\nProvision for loan losses\n4,931\n4,372\n4,594\n3,672\n2,016\nCharge-offs.\nCommercial business\n(4,153\n)\n(1,676\n)\n(5,252\n)\n(3,073\n)\n(3,726\n)\nOne-to-four family residential\n\u2014\n\u2014\n(31\n)\n(52\n)\n(391\n)\nReal estate construction and land development\n(154\n)\n(106\n)\n(345\n)\n(565\n)\n(1,280\n)\nConsumer\n(1,778\n)\n(1,700\n)\n(969\n)\n(681\n)\n(677\n)\nTotal charge-offs\n(6,085\n)\n(3,482\n)\n(6,597\n)\n(4,371\n)\n(6,074\n)\nRecoveries.\nCommercial business\n1,844\n476\n716\n808\n1,579\nOne-to-four family residential\n2\n13\n7\n\u2014\n\u2014\nReal estate construction and land development\n83\n100\n43\n32\n125\nConsumer\n562\n538\n142\n89\n33\nTotal recoveries\n2,491\n1,127\n908\n929\n1,737\nNet charge-offs\n(3,594\n)\n(2,355\n)\n(5,689\n)\n(3,442\n)\n(4,337\n)\nAllowance for loan losses at end of the year\n$31,083\n$29,746\n$27,729\n$28,824\n$28,594\nGross loans receivable at end of the year\n(1)\n$2,638,397\n$2,401,113\n$2,252,014\n$1,234,590\n$1,029,034\nAverage loans receivable during the year\n(1)\n2,489,730\n2,316,175\n1,871,696\n1,124,828\n996,186\nRatio of net charge-offs on loans to average loans receivable\n(0.14\n)%\n(0.10\n)%\n(0.30\n)%\n(0.31\n)%\n(0.44\n)%\n(1)\nExcludes loans held for sale.\n39\nTable of Contents\nThe following table shows the allocation of the allowance for loan losses at the indicated dates.

This compares to an allowance for loan losses at\nDecember 31, 2015\nof\n$29.7 million\n(\n1.24%\nof loans receivable, net and\n307.67%\nof nonperforming loans).\nWhile the Bank believes it has established its existing allowance for loan losses in accordance with GAAP, there can be no assurance that regulators, in reviewing the Bank's loan portfolios, will not request the Bank to increase its allowance for loan losses. In addition, because future events affecting borrowers and collateral cannot be predicted with certainty, there can be no assurance that the existing allowance for loan losses is appropriate or that increased provisions will not be necessary should the quality of the loans deteriorate.

The timing and amount of cash dividends paid on our common stock depends on the Company\u2019s earnings, capital requirements, financial condition and other relevant factors. Dividends on common stock from the Company depend substantially upon receipt of dividends from the Bank, which is the Company\u2019s predominant source of income.

Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.\u201d\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nIn the ordinary course of business, we enter into various types of transactions that include commitments to extend credit that are not included in our Consolidated Financial Statements. We apply the same credit standards to these commitments as we use in all our lending activities and have included these commitments in our lending risk evaluations. Our exposure to credit loss under commitments to extend credit is represented by the amount of these commitments.  The Company had off-balance sheet loan commitments, including letters of credit, aggregating $626.0 million at December 31, 2016, an increase of $53.5 million, or 9.4%, from $572.5 million at December 31, 2015.  For additional information, see Note (15) Commitments and Contingencies included in \u201cItem 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.\u201d\nAverage Balances, Yields and Rates Paid for the Years Ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014\nOur core profitability depends primarily on our net interest income, which is the difference between the income we receive on our loan and investment portfolios, and our cost of funds, which consists of interest paid on deposits and borrowed funds. Like most financial institutions, our interest income and cost of funds are affected significantly by general economic conditions, particularly changes in market interest rates and government policies.\nChanges in net interest income result from changes in volume, net interest spread, and net interest margin.\n43\nTable of Contents\nVolume refers to the average dollar amounts of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities. Net interest spread refers to the difference between the average yield on interest earning assets and the average cost of interest bearing liabilities. Net interest margin refers to net interest income divided by average interest earning assets and is influenced by the level and relative mix of interest earning assets and interest bearing and noninterest bearing liabilities.\nThe following table provides relevant net interest income information for selected periods. The average daily loan balances presented in the table are net of allowances for loan losses. Nonaccrual loans have been included in the tables as loans carrying a zero yield. Yields on tax-exempt securities and loans have not been presented on a tax-equivalent basis.\nYear Ended December 31,\n2016\n2015\n2014\nAverage\nBalance\nInterest\nEarned\/\nPaid\nAverage\nYield\/\nRate\nAverage\nBalance\nInterest\nEarned\/\nPaid\nAverage\nYield\/\nRate\nAverage\nBalance\nInterest\nEarned\/\nPaid\nAverage\nYield\/\nRate\n(Dollars in thousands)\nAssets.\nTotal loans receivable, net\n$2,489,730\n$122,147\n4.91%\n$2,316,175\n$121,687\n5.25%\n$1,871,696\n$110,437\n5.90%\nTaxable securities\n589,867\n11,215\n1.90\n548,787\n9,578\n1.75\n383,626\n7,328\n1.91\nNontaxable securities\n221,708\n4,870\n2.20\n204,443\n4,196\n2.05\n145,113\n2,886\n1.99\nOther interest earning assets\n44,951\n280\n0.62\n80,882\n278\n0.34\n150,189\n455\n0.30\nTotal interest earning assets\n3,346,256\n138,512\n4.14\n3,150,287\n135,739\n4.31\n2,550,624\n121,106\n4.75\nNoninterest earning assets\n399,279\n377,228\n295,666\nTotal assets\n$3,745,535\n$3,527,515\n$2,846,290\nLiabilities and Stockholders' Equity.\nCertificates of deposit\n$388,286\n$1,936\n0.50%\n$464,277\n$2,386\n0.51%\n$494,948\n$2,991\n0.60%\nSavings accounts\n485,482\n756\n0.16\n405,633\n445\n0.11\n282,150\n252\n0.09\nInterest bearing demand and money market accounts\n1,464,198\n2,318\n0.16\n1,374,757\n2,398\n0.17\n1,049,078\n1,907\n0.18\nTotal interest bearing deposits\n2,337,966\n5,010\n0.21\n2,244,667\n5,229\n0.23\n1,826,176\n5,150\n0.28\nJunior subordinated debentures\n19,565\n880\n4.50\n19,271\n827\n4.29\n12,751\n458\n3.59\nFHLB advances and other borrowings\n13,349\n74\n0.55\n1,777\n6\n0.34\n111\n\u2014\n\u2014\nSecurities sold under agreement to repurchase\n20,392\n42\n0.21\n23,522\n58\n0.25\n27,984\n73\n0.26\n44\nTable of Contents\nYear Ended December 31,\n2016\n2015\n2014\nAverage\nBalance\nInterest\nEarned\/\nPaid\nAverage\nYield\/\nRate\nAverage\nBalance\nInterest\nEarned\/\nPaid\nAverage\nYield\/\nRate\nAverage\nBalance\nInterest\nEarned\/\nPaid\nAverage\nYield\/\nRate\n(Dollars in thousands)\nTotal interest bearing liabilities\n2,391,272\n6,006\n0.25\n2,289,237\n6,120\n0.27\n1,867,022\n5,681\n0.30\nDemand and other noninterest bearing deposits\n829,912\n740,718\n574,692\nOther noninterest bearing liabilities\n38,474\n33,458\n29,669\nStockholders\u2019 equity\n485,877\n464,102\n374,907\nTotal liabilities and stockholders\u2019 equity\n$3,745,535\n$3,527,515\n$2,846,290\nNet interest income\n$132,506\n$129,619\n$115,425\nNet interest spread\n3.89%\n4.04%\n4.45%\nNet interest margin\n3.96%\n4.11%\n4.53%\nAverage interest earning assets to average interest bearing liabilities\n139.94%\n137.61%\n136.61%\n45\nTable of Contents\nThe following table provides the amount of change in our net interest income attributable to changes in volume and changes in interest rates.

The\n$1.4 million\n, or\n3.8%\nincrease in net income for the\nyear ended December 31, 2016\ncompared to the\nyear ended December 31, 2015\nwas primarily the result of a\n$2.9 million\n, or\n2.2%\n, increase in net interest income, primarily as a result of the increase in interest earning assets, offset partially by a decrease in the net interest margin. The net interest margin decreased 15 basis points to\n3.96%\nfor the\nyear ended December 31, 2016\ncompared to\n4.11%\nfor the same period in\n2015.\nThe efficiency ratio consists of noninterest expense divided by the sum of net interest income before provision for loan losses plus noninterest income. The Company\u2019s efficiency ratio decreased to\n64.9%\nfor the\nyear ended December 31, 2016\nfrom\n65.6%\nfor the\nyear ended December 31, 2015\n.  The decrease in the efficiency ratio for the\nyear ended December 31, 2016\ncompared to the\nyear ended December 31, 2015\nis attributable primarily to the above mentioned increase in net interest income.\nNoninterest expense as a percentage of average assets (or overhead ratio) is a metric utilized by the Bank to monitor its performance exclusive of the impact of market conditions on net interest margin.  The Company's noninterest expense ratio decreased to\n2.84%\nfor the year ended December 31, 2016 from\n3.01%\nduring the year ended December 31, 2015.  The decrease reflects the Company's growth in average assets and its efforts to reduce discretionary operating costs.\nNet Interest Income\nOne of the Company's key sources of earnings is net interest income.  There are several factors that affect net interest income including, but not limited to, the volume, pricing, mix and maturity of interest earning assets and\n46\nTable of Contents\ninterest bearing liabilities; the volume of noninterest bearing deposits and other liabilities and stockholders' equity; the volume of noninterest earning assets; market interest rate fluctuations; and asset quality.   Net interest income increased\n$2.9 million\n, or\n2.2%\n, to\n$132.5 million\nfor the year ended\nDecember 31, 2016\ncompared to\n$129.6 million\nfor the year ended December 31, 2015. The increase in net interest income was primarily due to an increase in average interest earning assets, partially offset by a decrease in the yield on average interest earning assets during the year ended December 31, 2016.\nInterest Income\nTotal interest income increased\n$2.8 million\n, or\n2.0%\n, to\n$138.5 million\nfor the\nyear ended December 31, 2016\ncompared to\n$135.7 million\nfor the year ended December 31,\n2015\n.  The balance of average interest earning assets increased\n$196.0 million\n, or\n6.2%\n, to\n$3.35 billion\nfor the\nyear ended December 31, 2016\nfrom\n$3.15 billion\nfor the\nyear ended December 31, 2015\n.   The yield on total interest earning assets decreased 17 basis points to\n4.14%\nfor the\nyear ended December 31, 2016\nfrom\n4.31%\nfor the\nyear ended December 31, 2015.\nTotal interest income increased primarily due to the\n$2.3 million\n, or\n16.8%\n, increase in interest income on investment securities to\n$16.1 million\nduring the\nyear ended December 31, 2016\nfrom\n$13.8 million\nfor the\nyear ended December 31, 2015\nas a result of both an increase in average balances and an increase in investment yields for the for the\nyear ended December 31, 2016\ncompared to the year ended December 31,\n2015\n.  The average balances of taxable and nontaxable securities increased\n$58.3 million\n, or\n7.7%\n, to\n$811.6 million\nfor the\nyear ended December 31, 2016\nfrom\n$753.2 million\nfor the\nyear ended December 31, 2015\n, primarily as a result of purchases of investment securities.  The yields on taxable securities increased 15 basis points to\n1.90%\nfor the\nyear ended December 31, 2016\nfrom\n1.75%\nfor the same period in\n2015\nand the yields on nontaxable securities increased 15 basis points to\n2.20%\nfor the\nyear ended December 31, 2016\nfrom\n2.05%\nfor the same period in\n2015\n.  The Company is actively managing its investment securities portfolio to mitigate declining loan yields.\nInterest income on loans increased\n$460,000\n, or\n0.4%\n, to\n$122.1 million\nfor the\nyear ended December 31, 2016\nfrom\n$121.7 million\nfor the same period in\n2015\ndue primarily to a\n$173.6 million\n, or\n7.5%\n, increase in the average balance of loans receivable to\n$2.49 billion\nfor the\nyear ended December 31, 2016\ncompared to\n$2.32 billion\nfor the year ended December 31, 2015 as a result of loan growth.  The impact on interest income as a result of the increase in average loan balances was partially offset by a decrease in loan yields, which was the result of a decrease in the contractual loan note rates and a decrease in the effects of incremental accretion income.  Loan yields decreased 34 basis points to\n4.91%\nfor the\nyear ended December 31, 2016\ncompared to\n5.25%\nfor the year ended December 31,\n2015.\nThe following table presents the loan yield and effects of the incremental accretion on purchased loans for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015.\nYear Ended December 31,\n2016\n2015\n(Dollars in thousands)\nLoan yield, excluding incremental accretion on purchased loans\n(1)\n4.62%\n4.81%\nImpact on loan yield from incremental accretion on purchased loans\n(1)\n0.29\n0.44\nLoan yield\n4.91%\n5.25%\nIncremental accretion on purchased loans\n(1)\n$7,155\n$10,293\n(1)\nAs of the dates of the completion of each of the merger and acquisition transactions, purchased loans were recorded at their estimated fair value, including our estimate of future expected cash flows until the ultimate resolution of these credits.  The difference between the contractual loan balance and the fair value represents the purchased discount.  The purchased discount is modified quarterly as a result of cash flow re-estimation.  The incremental accretion income represents the amount of income recorded on the purchased loans in excess of the contractual stated interest rate in the individual loan notes.\nThe incremental accretion income was\n$7.2 million\nand\n$10.3 million\nfor the years ended December 31, 2016 and\n2015\n, respectively.  The effect on loan yields from incremental accretion income decreased 15 basis points to\n0.29%\nfor the\nyear ended December 31, 2016\nfrom\n0.44%\nfor the\nyear ended December 31, 2015\nprimarily a result of a decrease in the prepayments of purchased loans, consisting primarily of loans from the Washington Banking Merger, during the\nyear ended December 31, 2016\ncompared to the same period in\n2015\n, and a continued decline in the purchased loan balances.\n47\nTable of Contents\nThe decrease in loan yields is also the result of an increase in LIBOR-based lending during the year ended December 31, 2016.  The Bank began entering into non-hedge interest rate swap contracts to accommodate the business needs of its lending customers during the third quarter of 2015.  Under these derivative contract arrangements with the borrower and a third party, the Bank effectively earns a variable rate of interest while the customer pays a fixed rate of interest.  These derivatives were all written using 1-month LIBOR as the variable indexed rate.  At December 31, 2016, the Bank had 28 separate interest rate swap contracts with borrowers with a notional value of $102.7 million compared to four interest rate swap contracts with borrowers with notional value of $20.7 million at December 31, 2015.  The $82.0 million, or 396.1%, increase in these LIBOR-based loans during 2016 resulted in a lower loan yield during the year ended December 31, 2016 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2015 as these variable rate loans earn less interest income than comparable fixed rate loans at the time of origination.  These LIBOR-based loans, however, will improve overall loan performance in a rising rate environment.\nInterest Expense\nTotal interest expense decreased by\n$114,000\n, or\n1.9%\n, to\n$6.0 million\nfor the\nyear ended December 31, 2016\nfrom\n$6.1 million\nfor the\nyear ended December 31, 2015\n.  The average cost of interest bearing liabilities decreased two basis points to\n0.25%\nfor the\nyear ended December 31, 2016\nfrom\n0.27%\nfor the\nyear ended December 31, 2015\n.  Total average interest bearing liabilities increased by\n$102.0 million\n, or\n4.5%\n, to\n$2.39 billion\nfor the\nyear ended December 31, 2016\nfrom\n$2.29 billion\nfor the\nyear ended December 31, 2015.\nTotal interest expense on interest bearing deposits decreased\n$219,000\n, or\n4.2%\n, to\n$5.0 million\nduring the\nyear ended December 31, 2016\nfrom\n$5.2 million\nthe same period in\n2015\n.  The average total cost of interest bearing deposits decreased two basis points to\n0.21%\nfor the\nyear ended December 31, 2016\nfrom\n0.23%\nfor the same period in\n2015.\nThe decrease in interest expense was primarily due to a\n$76.0 million\n, or\n16.4%\n, decrease in the average balance of certificates of deposit to\n$388.3 million\nduring the\nyear ended December 31, 2016\nfrom\n$464.3 million\nduring the same period in\n2015\nand a one basis point decrease in the cost on certificates of deposit to\n0.50%\nfrom\n0.51%\nfor the same respective periods.  Based on the change in the average balance and cost of the certificates of deposit, the interest expense on certificates of deposit decreased\n$450,000\n, or\n18.9%\n, to\n$1.9 million\nfor the\nyear ended December 31, 2016\nfrom\n$2.4 million\nfor the same period in\n2015.\nThe decrease in interest expense on certificates of deposit was offset by a\n$311,000\n, or\n69.9%\n, increase in the cost of savings accounts to\n$756,000\nfor the\nyear ended December 31, 2016\nfrom\n$445,000\nfor the same period in\n2015\n.  The increase in the cost of savings accounts during the\nyear ended December 31, 2016\nwas due to the combination of a\n$79.8 million\n, or\n19.7%\n, increase in the average balance of savings accounts to\n$485.5 million\nfor the\nyear ended December 31, 2016\nfrom\n$405.6 million\nfor the same period in\n2015\nand an increase of five basis points in the average cost of savings accounts to\n0.16%\nfor the\nyear ended December 31, 2016\nfrom\n0.11%\nfor the\nyear ended December 31, 2015.\nThe average rate of the junior subordinated debentures, including the effects of accretion of the discount established as of the date of the Washington Banking Merger, for the\nyear ended December 31, 2016\nwas\n4.50%\n, an increase of 21 basis points from\n4.29%\nfor the same period in\n2015.\nNet Interest Margin\nNet interest margin for the\nyear ended December 31, 2016\ndecreased 15 basis points to\n3.96%\nfrom\n4.11%\nfor the same period in\n2015\n.  The net interest spread for the\nyear ended December 31, 2016\ndecreased 15 basis points to\n3.89%\nfrom\n4.04%\nfor the same period in\n2015\n.   The decrease is primarily due to the above mentioned decrease in yields on total interest earning assets for the\nyear ended December 31, 2016.\nThe following table presents the net interest margins and effects of the incremental accretion on purchased loans for the years ended\nDecember 31, 2016\nand\nDecember 31, 2015\n.\nYear Ended December 31,\n2016\n2015\nNet interest margin, excluding incremental accretion on purchased loans\n(1)\n3.75%\n3.78%\nImpact on net interest margin from incremental accretion on purchased loans\n(1)\n0.21\n0.33\nNet interest margin\n3.96%\n4.11%\n(1)\nAs of the dates of the completion of each of the merger and acquisition transactions, purchased loans were recorded at their estimated fair value, including our estimate of future expected cash flows until the ultimate resolution of these credits.  The difference between the contractual loan balance and the fair value represents the purchased discount.  The purchased discount is accreted into income over the estimated remaining life of\n48\nTable of Contents\nthe loan or pool of loans, based upon results of the quarterly cash flow re-estimation.  The incremental accretion income represents the amount of income recorded on the purchased loans in excess of the contractual stated interest rate in the individual loan notes.\nProvision for Loan Losses\nThe Bank has established a comprehensive methodology for determining its allowance for loan losses.  The allowance for loan losses is increased by provisions for loan losses charged to expense, and is reduced by loans charged-off, net of loan recoveries or a recovery of previous provision.  The amount of the provision expense recognized during the years ended\nDecember 31, 2016\nand\n2015\nwas calculated in accordance with the Bank's methodology. For additional information, see \u201cItem 1. Business\u2014Analysis of Allowance for Loan Losses.\u201d\nThe provision for loan losses is dependent on the Company\u2019s ability to manage asset quality and control the level of net charge-offs through prudent underwriting standards. In addition, a decline in general economic conditions could increase future provisions for loan losses and have a material effect on the Company\u2019s net income.\nThe provision for loan losses increased $559,000, or 12.8%, to\n$4.9 million\nfor the year ended\nDecember 31, 2016\nfrom\n$4.4 million\nfor the year ended\nDecember 31, 2015\n. The increase in provision expense was due primarily the result of a $1.2 million increase in net charge-offs during 2016 in addition to changes in the volume and mix of loans, offset by the decrease in certain historical loss factors. The Bank had net charge-offs on loans of\n$3.6 million\nfor the year ended\nDecember 31, 2016\ncompared to\n$2.4 million\nfor the year ended\nDecember 31, 2015\n. The ratio of net charge-offs to average total loans outstanding was 0.14% for the year ended\nDecember 31, 2016\nand 0.10% for the year ended\nDecember 31, 2015\n. Total gross loans receivable at\nDecember 31, 2016\nand\n2015\nwere\n$2.64 billion\nand\n$2.40 billion\n, respectively.  Based on a thorough review of the loan portfolio, the Bank determined that the provision for loan losses for the year ended\nDecember 31, 2016\nwas appropriate as it was calculated in accordance with the Bank's methodology for determining allowance for loan losses.\nNoninterest Income\nTotal noninterest income decreased\n$649,000\n, or\n2.0%\n, to\n$31.6 million\nfor the year ended\nDecember 31, 2016\ncompared to\n$32.3 million\nfor the year ended December 31, 2015.

The decrease of net gain on the sale of the government guaranteed portion of certain SBA loans is a result of a decrease in SBA guarantee sales activities due to competitive pressures.  The net gain on sale of other loans was a result of the sale of two previously classified purchased credit impaired loans.\nThe Bank recorded a\n$1.7 million\ngain on termination of FDIC shared-loss agreements for the\nyear ended December 31, 2015\nas the Bank entered into an agreement terminating the shared-loss agreements for all three of the FDIC-assisted acquisitions during the year ended December 31, 2015.

The effects of this sale resulted in lower Merchant Visa income and a decrease in total noninterest income.\nInterest rate swap fees increased\n$1.4 million\n, or\n310.2%\n, to\n$1.9 million\nfor the\nyear ended December 31, 2016\ncompared to\n$452,000\nthe same period in\n2015\n, due primarily to an increase in the number of interest rate swap contracts executed during 2016.  The Bank began executing these types of contracts during the third quarter of 2015.  At December 31, 2016, the Bank had 28 contracts with borrowers with a notional value of $102.7 million compared to four contracts with borrowers with a notional value of $20.8 million at December 31, 2015.\nOther income decreased\n$391,000\n, or\n5.2%\n, to\n$7.1 million\nfor\nyear ended December 31, 2016\nfrom\n$7.5 million\nfor\nyear ended December 31, 2015\ndue primarily to a decrease in cash payments received on purchased loans charged-off prior to commencement of the acquisition or merger dates of $1.1 million. The decrease in other income was offset partially an FDIC indemnification was not recorded during the year ended December 31, 2016  because of the above-mentioned termination of the FDIC shared-loss agreements as compared to a reduction of income of $497,000 recorded during the year ended December 31, 2015.  The Bank also experienced an increase in fee income from annuities of $210,000 for the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to the same period in 2015.\nNoninterest Expense\nNoninterest expense increased\n$265,000\n, or\n0.2%\n, to\n$106.5 million\nfor the year ended\nDecember 31, 2016\ncompared to\n$106.2 million\nfor the year ended\nDecember 31, 2015.\nThe following table presents the key components of noninterest expense and the changes from prior year.\nYear Ended December 31,\n2016\n2015\nChange 2016 vs. 2015\nPercentage Change\n(Dollars in thousands)\nCompensation and employee benefits\n$61,405\n$58,134\n$3,271\n5.6%\nOccupancy and equipment\n15,763\n15,846\n(83\n)\n(0.5\n)\nData processing\n7,312\n7,700\n(388\n)\n(5.0\n)\nMarketing\n2,835\n3,066\n(231\n)\n(7.5\n)\nProfessional services\n3,606\n3,536\n70\n2.0\nState and local taxes\n2,616\n2,378\n238\n10.0\nFederal deposit insurance premium\n1,620\n2,046\n(426\n)\n(20.8\n)\nOther real estate owned, net\n334\n1,007\n(673\n)\n(66.8\n)\nAmortization of intangible assets\n1,415\n2,100\n(685\n)\n(32.6\n)\nOther expense\n9,567\n10,395\n(828\n)\n(8.0\n)\nTotal noninterest expense\n$106,473\n$106,208\n$265\n0.2%\nCompensation and employee benefits increased\n$3.3 million\n, or\n5.6%\n, to\n$61.4 million\nduring the\nyear ended December 31, 2016\ncompared to\n$58.1 million\nduring the\nyear ended December 31, 2015\n.  The increase was primarily due to the results of increased staffing in the metro markets, including Seattle and Bellevue, Washington and standard salary increases.\nData processing decreased\n$388,000\n, or\n5.0%\nto\n$7.3 million\nduring the\nyear ended December 31, 2016\nfrom\n$7.7 million\nduring the\nyear ended December 31, 2015\n.  The decrease was primarily a result of a $429,000 cancellation fee incurred during the year ended December 31, 2015 as a result of the early termination of a data processing contract.\n50\nTable of Contents\nFederal deposit insurance premium decreased\n$426,000\n, or\n20.8%\nto\n$1.6 million\nduring the\nyear ended December 31, 2016\nfrom\n$2.0 million\nduring the\nyear ended December 31, 2015\n.  The decrease was primarily a result of the FDIC's new assessment rate schedule that became effective beginning in the third quarter of 2016 due to the levels achieved in the Deposit Insurance Fund reserve.  Effective July 1, 2016, the range of initial base assessment rates for all insured institutions was reduced based on current reserve levels.\nOther real estate owned, net decreased\n$673,000\n, or\n66.8%\n, to\n$334,000\nduring the\nyear ended December 31, 2016\ncompared to\n$1.0 million\nduring the\nyear ended December 31, 2015\n.  The Bank had\n$754,000\nother real estate owned at\nDecember 31, 2016\ncompared to\n$2.0 million\nat\nDecember 31, 2015\n.  The decrease in other real estate owned, net was due to net gains on the sale of other real estate owned of\n$173,000\nduring the year ended\nDecember 31, 2016\ncompared to net losses on sale of other real estate owned of $97,000 during the year ended December 31, 2015 and a $146,000, or 27.6%, decrease in the valuation adjustment to $383,000 in fiscal year 2016 from $529,000 in fiscal year 2015.\nAmortization of intangible assets decreased $685,000, or 32.6%, during the year ended December 31, 2016 as the useful life of core deposit intangibles for certain acquisitions was reached, resulting in either a decrease in amortization for fiscal year 2016 or no further amortization expense recorded during the year ended December 31, 2016.\nOther expense decreased\n$828,000\n, or\n8.0%\n, to\n$9.6 million\nfor the\nyear ended December 31, 2016\nfrom\n$10.4 million\nfor the same period in\n2015\n. The decrease was primarily the result of a decrease in courier services as the Company discontinued its regular scheduled service during\n2015\n.  The Company also experienced decreases in other employee-related expenses such as travel expenses, office supplies, and other business expenses as a result of a concerted effort of the Company to reduce other discretionary expenses.\nThe ratio of noninterest expense to average assets was\n2.84%\nfor the\nyear ended December 31, 2016\n, compared to\n3.01%\nfor the\nyear ended December 31, 2015\n.  The decrease was primarily a result of an increase in assets due to the Bank's organic growth in addition to a relatively constant noninterest expense year-over-year due to the above mentioned efforts by the Company to reduce noninterest expenses.\nIncome Tax Expense\nIncome tax expense remained constant at\n$13.8 million\nfor both the years ended December 31, 2016 and\n2015\n. The Company\u2019s effective tax rate was\n26.2%\nfor the\nyear ended December 31, 2016\ncompared to\n26.9%\nfor the same period in\n2015\n. The decrease in the Company's effective tax rate during the\nyear ended December 31, 2016\ncompared to the same period in\n2015\nis primarily due to an increase in tax exempt loans and investment securities as compared to the increase in pre-tax net income and an increase in bank-owned life insurance (\"BOLI\") income, offset partially by the effects of  the resolution of certain Washington Banking tax liabilities during the year ended December 31, 2015.  For additional information, see Note (21) Income Taxes of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in \u201cItem 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.\u201d\nResults of Operations for the Years Ended\nDecember 31, 2015\nand\n2014\nEarnings Summary\nNet income of $1.25 per diluted common share was recorded for the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to $0.82 per diluted common share for the year ended December 31, 2014. Net income for the year ended December 31, 2015 was $37.5 million compared to net income of $21.0 million for the same period in 2014. The $16.5 million, or 78.4%, increase was primarily the result of a $14.6 million increase in interest income and a $15.8 million increase in noninterest income, partially offset by a $6.8 million increase in noninterest expense, a $6.9 million increase in income tax expense, and a $439,000 increase in interest expense. The Company\u2019s efficiency ratio decreased to 65.6% for the year ended December 31, 2015 from 75.3% for the year ended December 31, 2014 primarily due to net interest income increases related to the mergers and acquisitions as well as increased operating efficiencies which did not increase noninterest expenses to the same extent.\nNet Interest Income\nNet interest income increased $14.2 million, or 12.3%, to $129.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to $115.4 million for the previous year. The increase in net interest income was due primarily to a full fiscal year of operations attributable to the Washington Banking Merger, and the results of the positive effects of the discount accretion on the acquired loan portfolios for the year ended December 31, 2015.  The increase in net interest income was also due to an increase in average interest earning assets, again substantially attributable to the Washington Banking Merger. The increase in net interest income was partially offset by the decrease in the net interest margins due primarily to lower contractual loan note rates in the current lending environment.  Net interest income as a\n51\nTable of Contents\npercentage of average interest earning assets (net interest margin) for the year ended December 31, 2015 decreased 42 basis points to 4.11% from 4.53% for the previous year.  Our net interest spread for the year ended December 31, 2015 decreased 41 basis points to 4.04% from 4.45% for the prior year.\nTotal interest income increased $14.6 million, or 12.1%, to $135.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2015, from $121.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2014. The increase in interest income was due primarily to the effects of the Washington Banking Merger, offset partially by lower yields on interest earning assets and a decrease in accretion of discounts on acquired loans.  During the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, the Company recorded approximately $10.3 million and $14.3 million, respectively, of discount accretion into interest income that related to the acquired loans.  This income was incremental to the acquired loans' contractual interest income.  The balance of average interest earning assets (including nonaccrual loans) increased $599.7 million, or 23.5%, to $3.15 billion for the year ended December 31, 2015 from $2.55 billion for the year ended December 31, 2014.  The majority of this increase in interest earning assets was a result of the realization of the Washington Banking Merger for a full fiscal year.  The Company acquired in the Washington Banking Merger fair values at the May 1, 2014 merger date of $458.3 million in investment securities, $1.00 billion in loans and $7.1 million of FHLB stock.\nThe yield on interest earning assets decreased 44 basis points to 4.31% for the year ended December 31, 2015 from 4.75% for the year ended December 31, 2014. The decrease in the yield on interest earning assets for the year ended December 31, 2015 reflects the decreased loan yields due primarily to lower contractual note rates as well as a decrease of the effects of the overall discount accretion on all the acquired loan portfolios.\nThe effect of discount accretion on net interest margin for the year ended December 31, 2015 and December 31, 2014 was as follows.\nYear Ended December 31,\n2015\n2014\nNet interest margin, excluding incremental accretion on purchased loans\n(1)\n3.78%\n3.97%\nImpact on net interest margin from incremental accretion on purchased loans\n(1)\n0.33\n0.56\nNet interest margin\n4.11%\n4.53%\n(1)\nThe incremental accretion income represents the amount of income recorded on the purchased loans in excess of the contractual stated interest rate in the individual loan notes. This income results from the discount established at the time these loan portfolios were acquired and modified quarterly for PCI loans as a result of cash flow re-estimation.\nThe yield on interest earning assets was reduced by nonaccruing loans. Nonaccrual loans totaled $9.7 million at December 31, 2015 compared to $11.6 million at December 31, 2014.\nInterest income on taxable and nontaxable investment securities increased $3.6 million, or 34.9%, to $13.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 from $10.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2014 due primarily to an increase in the average investment securities as a result of the Washington Banking Merger and an increase in yields on nontaxable investments securities, offset by lower yields earned on the taxable investment securities in 2015 as a result of declining interest rates.  The changes in average balances and interest income on other interest earning assets had minimal impact on net interest margins for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014.\nTotal interest expense increased by $439,000, or 7.7%, to $6.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 from $5.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2014. The increase in interest expense was due to an increase in the average deposit balance, primarily as a result of the deposits acquired in the Washington Banking Merger which had a fair value at the acquisition date of $1.43 billion.  The effects of the increase in the average deposit balance was offset by lower rates paid on interest bearing deposits, reflecting the relatively low interest rate environment. The average rate paid on interest bearing deposits decreased to 0.23% for the year ended December 31, 2015 from 0.28% for the year ended December 31, 2014.   The Company also acquired junior subordinated debentures in the Washington Banking Merger with a fair value of $18.9 million at the merger date.  The average rate paid on these liabilities, including accretion of discount from purchase accounting fair value adjustment, during 2015 was 4.29% compared to 3.59% during 2014.  Total average interest bearing liabilities increased by $422.2 million, or 22.6%, to $2.29 billion for the year ended December 31, 2015 from $1.87 billion for the year ended December 31, 2014 and the average rate was 0.27% and 0.30%, respectively.\nProvision for Loan Losses\nThe provision for loan losses decreased $222,000, or 4.8%, to $4.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 from $4.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2014. The decrease in provision expense was due primarily to the resolution of nonperforming loans and a decrease in net charge-offs during the year ended December 31, 2015\n52\nTable of Contents\ncompared to the prior year, offset partially by an increase in the volume of loans.  The Bank had net charge-offs on loans of $2.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to $5.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2014. The ratio of net charge-offs to average total loans outstanding was 0.10% for the year ended December 31, 2015 and 0.30% for the year ended December 31, 2014. Total gross loans receivable at December 31, 2015 and 2014 were $2.40 billion and $2.25 billion, respectively.\nAs shown in the table below, the general allowance as a percentage of gross loans, excluding PCI and impaired loans, was 0.76% and 0.71% at December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively.  The increase in the percentage during the noted periods was due primarily to an increase in the volume of loans, a change in the historical loss factors and change in the mix of loans.  The general allowance also increased during the year ended December 31, 2015 as a result of the mergers and acquisitions, since the acquired Non-PCI loans were recorded at a net discount at the merger date and, accordingly, no allowance for loan losses was initially recorded for the acquired loans. As the remaining discounts are accreted into income, the Company may determine a provision for loan losses is necessary which may increase the allowance for loan losses. The remaining discount for these acquired Non-PCI loans was $9.4 million and $14.2 million at December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively.\nThe following table outlines the allowance for loan losses and related outstanding loan balances on loans at December 31, 2015 and 2014.\nDecember 31, 2015\nDecember 31, 2014\n(Dollars in thousands)\nGeneral Valuation Allowance.\nAllowance for loan losses\n$17,354\n$15,016\nGross loans, excluding PCI and impaired loans\n2,283,832\n2,102,512\nPercentage\n0.76%\n0.71%\nPCI Allowance.\nAllowance for loan losses\n$9,084\n$9,055\nGross PCI loans\n86,919\n119,271\nPercentage\n10.45%\n7.59%\nSpecific Valuation Allowance.\nAllowance for loan losses\n$3,308\n$3,658\nGross impaired loans\n30,362\n30,231\nPercentage\n10.90%\n12.10%\nTotal Allowance for Loan Losses.\nAllowance for loan losses\n$29,746\n$27,729\nGross loans receivable\n2,401,113\n2,252,014\nPercentage\n1.24%\n1.23%\nThe allowance for loan losses increased by $2.0 million, or 7.3%, to $29.7 million at December 31, 2015 from $27.7 million at December 31, 2014.  As of December 31, 2015, the Bank identified $9.7 million of nonperforming loans and $20.7 million of performing TDR loans for a total of $30.4 million of impaired loans. Of these impaired loans, $6.0 million had no allowances for loan losses as their estimated collateral value or discounted expected cash flow is equal to or exceeds their carrying costs. The remaining $24.3 million had related allowances for loan losses totaling $3.3 million. Based on the comprehensive methodology, management deemed the allowance for loan losses of $29.7 million at December 31, 2015 (1.24% of loans receivable, net and 307.67% of nonperforming loans) appropriate to provide for probable incurred losses based on an evaluation of known and inherent risks in the loan portfolio at that date.\n53\nTable of Contents\nNoninterest Income\nTotal noninterest income increased $15.8 million, or 96.0%, to $32.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to $16.5 million for the prior year.

See \"Item 1. Business - Deposit Activities and Other Sources of Funds\" for additional information.  Total deposits increased $202.0 million, or 6.9% to $3.11 billion at December 31, 2015 from $2.91 billion at December 31, 2014.\nThe change in FDIC indemnification asset includes amortization of the FDIC indemnification asset and increases\/decreases to the FDIC indemnification asset as a result of changes in projected remaining cash flows of the related loans.  The balance of the indemnification asset at December 31, 2014 was $1.1 million.  During the year ended December 31, 2015, the Company's three FDIC shared-loss agreements were all in the fifth year after which the majority of the covered loans would no longer have shared-loss coverage.  The forthcoming change in the coverage resulted in accelerated amortization and change in the FDIC indemnification asset during the year ended December 31, 2014.  On August 5, 2015, the Company and the FDIC entered into a termination agreement which effectively eliminated the shared-loss agreements. The Company recorded a $1.7 million pre-tax gain on the termination of the shared-loss agreements.  For additional information see Note (6) FDIC Indemnification Asset of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in \"Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.\"  There was no FDIC indemnification asset at December 31, 2015.\nGain on sale of investment securities, net, increased $1.2 million, or 428.2%, to $1.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 from $287,000 for the year ended December 31, 2014 as a result of the Company's efforts of managing more effectively its investment portfolio.  While the Company's proceeds of sales of investment securities available for sale decreased to $116.3 million during the year ended December 31, 2015 as compared to $157.0 million during the year ended December 31, 2014, the strategic sales of certain investments resulted in an increase of net gains on sale of investment securities during the year ended December 31, 2015.  The increase in gain on sales of investment securities, net was partially offset by the sale of the Company's entire portfolio of private residential collateralized mortgage obligations during the year ended December 31, 2015 with a carrying value of $1.1 million, all of which were formerly classified as held-to-maturity.  Since these securities were acquired, they had been downgraded below the Company's acceptable investment grades.  The Company recorded a realized loss of $125,000 on this sale.\nGain on sale of loans, net, increased $3.2 million, or 208.5%, to $4.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 from $1.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2014 as a result of the Bank resuming mortgage banking operations in conjunction with the Washington Banking Merger.  The Bank had ceased mortgage banking operations in the second quarter of 2013 and resumed these operations on the May 1, 2014 effective date of the merger as Washington Banking had a strong operational presence in mortgage banking operations.\n54\nTable of Contents\nOther income increased $2.9 million, or 59.0%, to $7.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 from $5.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2014, partially as a result of earnings on the BOLI which increased to $1.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to $455,000 for the prior year.  The BOLI income increase was the result of a full fiscal year of the BOLI acquired in the Washington Banking Merger as well as the purchase of $25.0 million of additional BOLI during the year ended December 31, 2015.  The Company also recorded an additional $214,000 of recoveries on legacy Washington Banking loans which were fully charged-off prior to the merger date during the year ended December 31, 2015 as compared to 2014.\nNoninterest Expense\nNoninterest expense increased $6.8 million, or 6.9%, to $106.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to $99.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2014.\nThe following table presents the key components of noninterest expense and the changes from prior year.\nYear Ended December 31,\n2015\n2014\nChange 2015 vs. 2014\nPercentage Change\nCompany Initiatives\n(1)\n(Dollars in thousands)\nCompensation and employee benefits\n$58,134\n$52,634\n$5,500\n10.4%\n$1,522\nOccupancy and equipment\n15,846\n13,406\n2,440\n18.2\n602\nData processing\n7,700\n9,243\n(1,543\n)\n(16.7\n)\n3,038\nMarketing\n3,066\n2,502\n564\n22.5\n140\nProfessional services\n3,536\n6,185\n(2,649\n)\n(42.8\n)\n3,751\nState and local taxes\n2,378\n1,976\n402\n20.3\n\u2014\nImpairment loss on investment securities, net\n\u2014\n45\n(45\n)\n(100.0\n)\n\u2014\nFederal deposit insurance premium\n2,046\n1,718\n328\n19.1\n\u2014\nOther real estate owned, net\n1,007\n638\n369\n57.8\n\u2014\nAmortization of intangible assets\n2,100\n1,920\n180\n9.4\n\u2014\nOther expense\n10,395\n9,112\n1,283\n14.1\n535\nTotal noninterest expense\n$106,208\n$99,379\n$6,829\n6.9%\n$9,588\n(1) Balances represent the cost of Company initiatives for the year ended December 31, 2014 as discussed in detail below.  There were no related costs for the year ended December 31, 2015.\nThe increase in total noninterest expense for the year ended December 31, 2015 was due primarily to the full fiscal year of expenses related to the Washington Banking Merger which was effective May 1, 2014.  The increase in expense is related primarily to compensation and employee benefits which increased $5.5 million, or 10.4%, to $58.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 as compared to $52.6 million for the prior year.  The increase in compensation and employee benefits as a result of a full year of costs was partially offset by a decrease in staffing levels.  The average full time equivalent was 766 and 782 during the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively.  Occupancy and equipment costs increased during the year ended December 31, 2015 by $2.4 million, or 18.2%, to $15.8 million from $13.4 million as the branching network increased to 67 as of December 31, 2015 from 36 branches prior to the Washington Banking Merger.  The Company has 26 bank branch leases and three land leases at December 31, 2015.\nAs part of the Company's strategic initiatives, certain measures were taken to transform the Company's branching system subsequent to December 31, 2015.  Three branches operating at December 31, 2015 were closed subsequent to year-end and consolidated into existing Heritage Bank branches. The Company additionally consolidated two branches in the Metro markets into business banking centers on upper floor commercial office space, creating strong partnerships between retail, commercial and cash management teams.  These branch transformations were completed during the year ended December 31, 2016. The branch transformations are anticipated to reduce the occupancy and equipment expense in future periods.\nThis increase in noninterest expense during year ended December 31, 2015 was offset by the specific costs of $9.6 million recognized during the year ended December 31, 2014 identified as Company Initiatives.  These initiative costs include the Washington Banking Merger totaling $9.1 million, the Valley Acquisition totaling $443,000, a core system conversion totaling $40,000, and the consolidation of existing branches totaling $11,000. These merger and acquisitions are discussed in Notes (1) Description of Business, Basis of Presentation, Significant Accounting Policies\n55\nTable of Contents\nand Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements and (2) Business Combinations of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in \"Item. 8 Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\" of this Form 10-K.   These costs include identifiable costs paid to third party providers as well as any retention bonuses or severance payments made in conjunction with these initiatives.  The amounts do not include costs of additional staffing required to be maintained or utilized during a period of time in order to complete the initiatives.\nThe types of expenses associated with the significant Company Initiatives expense categories in the table above are summarized as follows.\n\u2022\nCompensation and employee benefits expense consisted substantially of retention bonus and severances packages paid to transition employees.\n\u2022\nOccupancy and equipment expense consisted primarily of lease termination costs.\n\u2022\nData processing expense consisted of costs relating to the Company\u2019s core system conversion as well as data conversions of the Whidbey Island Bank information to the Heritage core system.\n\u2022\nProfessional services expense related to fees paid to: (1) financial advisors for the Washington Banking Merger, and (2) attorney, accountant and consultant fees related to merger and acquisitions.\nOther expense increased $1.3 million, or 14.1%, to $10.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 from $9.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2014.  Other expense includes, but is not limited to, items such as courier services, phone costs, travel expenses, investor relations, and certain employee-related costs such as travel and meals.  The increases in other expense are primarily as a result of the Washington Banking Merger and the general increase due to the growth of the Company during the year ended December 31, 2015 which is demonstrated by the increase in total assets to $3.65 billion at December 31, 2015 from $3.46 billion at December 31, 2014.\nThe efficiency ratio for the year ended December 31, 2015 was 65.6% compared to 75.3% for the prior year.  The efficiency ratio consists of noninterest expense divided by the sum of net interest income before provision for loan losses plus noninterest income. The decrease in the ratio for the year ended December 31, 2015 was primarily related to the increase in net interest income related to mergers and acquisitions as described above which outpaced the increase in the noninterest expense as described above.  The Company gained such efficiencies based on the merged company as a result of the reduction of duplicate operating contracts and decrease in staffing levels.\nIncome Tax Expense\nThe provision for income taxes increased by $6.9 million to an expense of $13.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 from an expense of $6.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2014. The Company\u2019s effective income tax rate was 26.9% for the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to 24.7% for the same period in 2014. The increase in the Company\u2019s effective income tax rate from the prior year was primarily due to tax-exempt income being a lower percentage of pre-tax income in 2015 (4.8%) than it was in 2014 (5.7%).\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nOur primary sources of funds are customer and local government deposits, loan principal and interest payments, loan sales, interest earned on and proceeds from sales and maturities of investment securities. These funds, together with retained earnings, equity and other borrowed funds, are used to make loans, acquire investment securities and other assets, and fund continuing operations. While maturities and scheduled amortization of loans are a predictable source of funds, deposit flows and loan prepayments are greatly influenced by the level of interest rates, economic conditions, and competition.\nWe must maintain an adequate level of liquidity to ensure the availability of sufficient funds to fund loan originations and deposit withdrawals, satisfy other financial commitments, and fund operations. We generally maintain sufficient cash and investments to meet short-term liquidity needs.  At\nDecember 31, 2016\n, cash and cash equivalents totaled\n$103.7 million\n, or\n2.7%\nof total assets. Investment securities available for sale totaled\n$794.6 million\nat\nDecember 31, 2016\n, of which\n$248.1 million\nwere pledged to secure public deposits, borrowing arrangements or repurchase agreements.  Management considers unpledged investment securities available for sale to be a viable source of liquidity. The fair value of investment securities available for sale that were not pledged to secure public deposits, borrowing arrangements or repurchase agreements totaled\n$546.5 million\n, or\n14.1%\nof total assets at\nDecember 31, 2016\n.  The fair value of investment securities available for sale with maturities of one year or less amounted to\n$6.7 million\n, or\n0.17%\nof total assets.  At\nDecember 31, 2016\n, the Bank maintained credit facilities with the FHLB of Des Moines for\n$549.0 million\n, of which there were\n$79.6 million\nof borrowings outstanding as of\nDecember 31, 2016\n, and credit facilities with the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco for\n$45.9 million\n, of which there were\nno\nborrowings outstanding as of December 31, 2016.  The Bank also maintains advance lines with Wells Fargo Bank, US Bank, TIB and Pacific Coast Bankers\u2019 Bank to purchase federal funds totaling\n$90.0 million\nas of\nDecember 31, 2016\n.  As of\nDecember 31, 2016\n, there were\nno\novernight federal funds purchased.\n56\nTable of Contents\nOur strategy has been to acquire core deposits (which we define to include all deposits except public funds, brokered CDs and other wholesale deposits) from our retail accounts, acquire noninterest bearing demand deposits from our commercial customers and use our available borrowing capacity to fund growth in assets. We anticipate that we will continue to rely on the same sources of funds in the future and use those funds primarily to make loans and purchase investment securities.\nContractual Obligations\nThe following table provides the amounts due under specified contractual obligations for the periods indicated as of\nDecember 31, 2016\n.\nDecember 31, 2016\nOne Year or Less\nOne to Three Years\nOver Three to Five Years\nOver Five Years\nOther (1)\nTotal\n(In thousands)\nContractual payments by period.\nDeposits\n$235,173\n$95,170\n$27,008\n$50\n$2,872,247\n$3,229,648\nJunior subordinated debentures\n\u2014\n\u2014\n\u2014\n25,000\n\u2014\n25,000\nOperating leases\n3,409\n5,548\n3,555\n2,143\n\u2014\n14,655\nTotal contractual obligations\n$238,582\n$100,718\n$30,563\n$27,193\n$2,872,247\n$3,269,303\n(1)\nRepresents interest bearing and noninterest bearing checking, money market and checking accounts which can generally be withdrawn on demand and thereby have an undefined maturity.\nAsset\/Liability Management\nOur primary financial objective is to achieve long-term profitability while controlling our exposure to fluctuations in market interest rates. To accomplish this objective, we have formulated an interest rate risk management policy that attempts to manage the mismatch between asset and liability maturities while maintaining an acceptable interest rate sensitivity position. The principal strategies which we employ to control our interest rate sensitivity are: originating certain commercial business loans and real estate construction and land development loans at variable interest rates repricing for terms generally one year or less; and offering noninterest bearing demand deposit accounts to businesses and individuals. The longer-term objective is to increase the proportion of noninterest bearing demand deposits, low-rate interest bearing demand deposits, money market accounts, and savings deposits relative to certificates of deposit to reduce our overall cost of funds.\nA number of measures are used to monitor and manage interest rate risk, including income simulations, interest sensitivity (gap) analysis and economic value of equity sensitivity. An income simulation model is the primary tool used to assess the direction and magnitude of changes in net interest income resulting from changes in interest rates. Key assumptions in the model include prepayment speeds on loans and investment securities, decay rates on non-maturity deposits, and pricing on investment securities, loans, deposits and borrowings. In order to measure the interest rate risk sensitivity as of December 31, 2016, this simulation model uses a \u201cno growth\u201d assumption  and assumes an instantaneous and sustained uniform change in market interest rates at all maturities. These assumptions are inherently uncertain and, as a result, the net interest income projections should be viewed as an estimate of the net interest income sensitivity at the time of the analysis. Actual results will differ from simulated results due to timing, magnitude and frequency of interest rate changes and changes in market conditions and management strategies, among other factors.\nBased on the results of the simulation model as of December 31, 2016, we would expect decreases in net interest income of $909,000 and $5.2 million in year one and year two, respectively, if interest rates increased from current rates by 100 basis points. We would expect an increase in net interest income of $2.0 million and $10.3 million in year one and year two, respectively, if interest rates increased from current rates by 200 basis points.\nOur asset and liability management strategies have resulted in a negative less than 3 month \u201cgap\u201d of\n41.7%\nas of\nDecember 31, 2016\n.  This \u201cgap\u201d measures the difference between the dollar amount of our interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities that mature or reprice within the designated period (three months or less) as a percentage\n57\nTable of Contents\nof total interest earning assets, based on certain estimates and assumptions as discussed below. We believe that the implementation of our operating strategies has reduced the potential effects of changes in market interest rates on our results of operations. The negative gap for the less than three month period indicates that decreases in market interest rates may favorably affect our results over that period.\nThe following table provides the estimated maturity or repricing and the resulting interest rate sensitivity gap of our interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities at\nDecember 31, 2016\n.  We used certain assumptions in presenting this data so the amounts may not be consistent with other financial information prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. The amounts in the tables also could be significantly affected by external factors, such as changes in prepayment assumptions, early withdrawal of deposits and competition.\nDecember 31, 2016\nEstimated Maturity or Repricing Within\nThree Months or Less\nOver Three Months to 12\nMonths\nOver One to Five Years\nOver Five to 15\nYears\nOver\n15 Years\nTotal\n(Dollars in thousands)\nInterest Earnings Assets.\nLoans Receivable\n(1)\n$618,225\n$161,876\n$1,242,743\n$554,654\n$60,899\n$2,638,397\nInvestment securities\n(2)\n86,967\n25,761\n170,344\n323,882\n187,691\n794,645\nFHLB stock\n7,564\n\u2014\n\u2014\n\u2014\n\u2014\n7,564\nInterest earning deposits\n26,628\n\u2014\n\u2014\n\u2014\n\u2014\n26,628\nTotal interest earning assets\n$739,384\n$187,637\n$1,413,087\n$878,536\n$248,590\n$3,467,234\nPercentage of interest earning assets\n21.3%\n5.4%\n40.8%\n25.3%\n7.2%\n100.0%\nInterest Bearing Liabilities.\nTotal interest bearing deposits\n(3)\n$2,064,837\n$160,692\n$121,979\n$49\n$\u2014\n$2,347,557\nFederal Home Loan Bank advances\n79,600\n\u2014\n\u2014\n\u2014\n\u2014\n79,600\nJunior subordinated debentures\n19,717\n\u2014\n\u2014\n\u2014\n\u2014\n19,717\nSecurities sold under agreement to repurchase\n22,104\n\u2014\n\u2014\n\u2014\n\u2014\n22,104\nTotal interest bearing liabilities\n$2,186,258\n$160,692\n$121,979\n$49\n$\u2014\n$2,468,978\nInterest bearing liabilities, as a percentage of total interest earning assets\n63.1%\n4.6%\n3.5%\n\u2014%\n\u2014%\n71.2%\nInterest rate sensitivity gap\n$(1,446,874\n)\n$26,945\n$1,291,108\n$878,487\n$248,590\n$998,256\nInterest rate sensitivity gap, as a percentage of total interest earning assets\n(41.7\n)%\n0.8%\n37.2%\n25.3%\n7.2%\n28.8%\nCumulative interest rate sensitivity gap\n$(1,446,874\n)\n$(1,419,929\n)\n$(128,821\n)\n$749,666\n$998,256\nCumulative interest rate sensitivity gap, as a percentage of total interest earning assets\n(41.7\n)%\n(41.0\n)%\n(3.7\n)%\n21.6%\n28.8%\n(1)\nExcludes deferred loan costs (fees), net and allowance for loan losses.\n(2)\nInterest earning investment securities with no stated maturity date are included in less than three months as prices may adjust immediately.\n(3)\nAdjustable-rate liabilities are included in the period in which interest rates are next scheduled to adjust rather than in the period they are due to mature. Although regular savings, demand, NOW, and money market deposit accounts are subject to immediate\n58\nTable of Contents\nwithdrawal, based on historical experience management considers a substantial amount of such accounts to be core deposits having significantly longer maturities.\nCertain shortcomings are inherent in the method of analysis presented in the foregoing table. For example, although certain assets and liabilities may have similar maturities or periods to repricing, they may react in different degrees to changes in market interest rates. Also, the interest rates on some types of assets and liabilities may fluctuate in advance of changes in market interest rates, while interest rates on other types may lag behind changes in market interest rates. Additionally, some assets, such as adjustable rate mortgages, have features, which restrict changes in the interest rates of those assets both on a short-term basis and over the lives of such assets. Further, if a change in market interest rates occurs, prepayment and early withdrawal levels could deviate significantly from those assumed in calculating the tables. Finally, the ability of many borrowers to service their adjustable rate debt may decrease if market interest rates increase substantially.\nThe table below provides information about our financial instruments that are sensitive to changes in interest rates as of\nDecember 31, 2016\n.

Unlike most industrial companies, virtually all the assets and liabilities of a financial institution are monetary in nature.  As a result, changes in interest rates generally have a more significant impact on a financial institution\u2019s performance than the effects of general levels of inflation.  Although interest rates do not necessarily move in the same direction or the same extent as the prices of goods and services, increases in inflation generally have resulted in increased interest rates.","72":"","73":"ITEM 7.\nMANAGEMENT\u2019S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.\nOverview\nThe Fund is a financial services company providing financing and advisory services to a variety of carefully selected venture-backed companies primarily throughout the United States with a focus on growth oriented companies.  The Fund\u2019s portfolio is well diversified and consists of companies in the communications, information services, media, and technology, including software and technology-enabled business services, bio-technology, and medical devices industry sectors, among others.  The Fund\u2019s capital is generally used by portfolio companies to finance acquisitions of fixed assets and working capital.  On August 31, 2015, the Fund completed its first closing of capital contributions.  On September 1, 2015, the Fund made its first investments, and became a non-diversified, closed-end investment company that elected to be treated as a business development company under the Investment Company Act of 1940.  The Fund expects to eventually elect to be treated for federal income tax purposes as a Regulated Investment Company (\u201cRIC\u201d) under the Internal Revenue Code (the \"Code\").  Pursuant to this election, the Fund generally will not have to pay corporate-level taxes on any income it distributes to the Company as dividends, allowing the Company to substantially reduce or eliminate its corporate-level tax liability.\nThe Fund will seek to meet the ongoing requirements, including the diversification requirements, to qualify as a RIC under the Internal Revenue Code.  If the Fund fails to meet these requirements, it will be taxed as an ordinary corporation on its taxable income for that year (even if that income is distributed to the Company) and all distributions out of its earnings and profits will be taxable to the Members of the Company as ordinary income; thus, such income will be subject to a double layer of tax.  There is no assurance that the Fund will meet the ongoing requirements to qualify as a RIC for tax purposes.\nThe Fund's investment objective is to achieve a superior risk adjusted investment returns.  The Fund seeks to achieve its investment objective by providing debt financing to portfolio companies.  Since inception, the Fund's investing activities have focused primarily on private debt securities.  The Fund generally receives warrants to acquire equity securities in connection with its portfolio investments.  The Fund generally distributes these warrants to its shareholder upon receipt.  The Fund also has guidelines for the percentages of total assets which will be invested in different types of assets.\nThe portfolio investments of the Fund will primarily consist of debt financing to venture capital backed technology companies.  The borrower's ability to repay its loans may be adversely impacted by a number of factors, and as a result, the loan may not fully be repaid.  Furthermore, the Fund's security interest in any collateral over the borrower's assets may be insufficient to make up any shortfall in payments.\nCritical Accounting Policies\nCritical Accounting Policies and Practices are those accounting policies and practices that are both the most important to the portrayal of the Fund's net assets and results of operations and require the most difficult, subjective or complex judgments, often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain.  Critical accounting estimates are accounting estimates where the nature of the estimates are material due to the levels of subjectivity and judgment necessary to account for highly uncertain matters or the susceptibility of such matters to change and the impact of the estimates of the on net assets or operating performance is material.\nThe Manager has identified the most critical accounting policies and estimates to be the estimate of the fair value of the Fund\u2019s loan investments.  The Fund defines fair value as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date; that is, an exit price. The exit price assumes the asset or liability was exchanged in an orderly transaction; it was not a forced liquidation or distressed sale.  There is no secondary market for the loans made by the Fund to borrowers, hence Management determines fair value based on hypothetical market and the estimates are subject to high levels of judgment and uncertainty.  The Fund\u2019s loan investments are considered Level 3 fair value measurements in the fair value hierarchy due to the lack of observability over many of the important inputs used in determining fair value.\nCritical judgments and inputs in determining the fair value of a loan include payment history, available cash and \u201cburn rate,\u201d revenues, net income or loss, operating results, financial strength of borrower, prospects for the borrower's raising future equity rounds, likelihood of sale or acquisition of the borrower, length of expected holding period of the loan, collateral position, the timing and amount of liquidation of collateral for loans that are experiencing significant credit deterioration and collection becomes collateral dependent as well as an evaluation of the general interest rate environment. Management has evaluated these factors and has concluded that the effect of a deterioration in the quality of the underlying collateral, increase in the size of the loan, increase in the estimated time to recovery, and increase in the hypothetical market coupon rate would have the effect of decreasing the fair value of loan investments.  The risk profile of a loan changes when events occur that impact the credit analysis of the borrower and the loan. Such changes result in the fair value being adjusted from par value of the individual loan. Where the risk profile is consistent with the original underwriting, the par value of the loan often approximates fair value.\nThe actual value of the loans may differ from management\u2019s estimates, which would affect net change in net assets resulting from operations as well as assets.\n17\nResults of Operations \u2013 For the year ended\nDecember 31, 2016\n, and the period from August 12, 2015, the commencement of operations, through\nDecember 31, 2015\nThe Fund did not commence operations until August 12, 2015.\nTotal investment income for the year ended\nDecember 31, 2016\nand the period from August 12, 2015, commencement of operations, through\nDecember 31, 2015\nwas\n$11.7 million\nand\n$0.6 million\n, which primarily consisted of interest on venture loans outstanding.  The remaining income consisted of interest and dividends on the temporary investment of cash, and other income from commitment fees and warrants.  The average gross outstanding performing loans calculated on a monthly basis was\n$75.6 million\nfor the year ended\nDecember 31, 2016\nand on a daily basis was\n$11.9 million\nfor the period from August 12, 2015, commencement of operations, through\nDecember 31, 2015\n.  The average interest rate on gross outstanding performing loans was\n15.34%\nand\n15.62%\nfor the same periods, respectively.  Interest is calculated using the effective interest method, and rates earned by the Fund will fluctuate based on many factors including early payoffs, volatility of values ascribed to warrants, and new loans funded during the year.\nExpenses for the year ended\nDecember 31, 2016\nand period from August 12, 2015, commencement of operations, through was\nDecember 31, 2015\nwas\n$12.5 million\nand\n$4.4 million\n.  Management fees are calculated based on the Company\u2019s committed capital for the first two years of the Fund\u2019s life and thereafter as a percentage of Fund assets.  Management fees for the Fund was\n$10.6 million\nfor the year ended\nDecember 31, 2016\nand\n$4.1 million\nfor the period from August 12, 2015, commencement of operations, through\nDecember 31, 2015\n.  Until August 11, 2017, management fees will be calculated as 2.5 percent of the committed capital of the Company.  Starting on August 12, 2017, management fees will be calculated as 2.5 percent of the Fund's total assets.\nTotal organizational costs for the year ended\nDecember 31, 2016\nand the period from August 12, 2015, commencement of operations, through\nDecember 31, 2015\nwas\n$0\nand\n$0.2 million\n. The banking and professional fees were\n$0.3 million\nand less than\n$0.1 million\nfor the year ended\nDecember 31, 2016\nand period from August 12, 2015, commencement of operations, through\nDecember 31, 2015\n, respectively.\nOther operating expenses was\n$0.1 million\nand less than\n$0.1 million\nfor the year ended\nDecember 31, 2016\nand period from August 12, 2015, commencement of operations, through\nDecember 31, 2015\n, respectively.  These expenses included director fees, custody fee, and other expenses related to the operation of the Fund.\nNet investment loss for the year ended\nDecember 31, 2016\nand the period from August 12, 2015, commencement of operations, through\nDecember 31, 2015\n, was\n$0.7 million\nand\n$3.8 million.\nNet change in unrealized loss from investments was\n$3.3 million\nand\n$0\nfor the year ended\nDecember 31, 2016\nand the period from August 12, 2015, commencement of operations, through\nDecember 31, 2015\n, respectively.  The unrealized loss consists of fair value adjustments taken against loans as a result of a deterioration in the companies performance.\nNet decrease in net assets resulting from operations for the year ended\nDecember 31, 2016\nand the period from August 12, 2015, commencement of operations, through\nDecember 31, 2015\nwas\n$4.0 million\nand\n$3.8 million\n. On a per share basis, the net decrease in net assets resulting from operations was\n$40.02\nand\n$37.88\nfor the year ended\nDecember 31, 2016\nand the period from August 12, 2015, commencement of operations, through\nDecember 31, 2015\n, respectively.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources --\nDecember 31, 2016\nand\n2015\nThe Fund is owned entirely by the Company.  The Company is expected, but not required, to make further contributions to the capital of the Fund to the extent of the Company\u2019s members\u2019 capital commitment to the Company and excess cash balances of the Company.  As of\nDecember 31, 2016\nthe Company had received subscriptions for capital in the amount of\n$423.6\nmillion, of which\n$116.5\nmillion had been called and received.  As of\nDecember 31, 2016\n,\n$307.1\nmillion of capital remains uncalled.  The remaining\n$307.1\nmillion in committed capital as of\nDecember 31, 2016\nis due to expire in August 2020 as the five year anniversary will have passed, at which time no further capital may be called.  However, the Manager is permitted to extend the Fund's  investment period by up two (2) additional calendar quarters in its sole and absolute discretion.\nOn April 5, 2016, the Fund has established a secured, syndicated revolving credit facility (the \u201cLoan Agreement\u201d) led by Wells Fargo Bank, N.A. and MUFG Union Bank, N.A. in an initial amount of up to $150,000,000. Borrowings by the Fund are collateralized by all of the assets of the Fund.  Loans under the facility may be, at the option of the Fund, either a Reference Rate Loan or a LIBOR Rate Loan.  The Fund will pay interest on its borrowings, and will also pay a fee on the unused portion of the facility.\nThe facility terminates on April 5, 2019, but can be accelerated in the event of default, such as failure by the Fund to make timely interest or principal payments.  As of\nDecember 31, 2016\n,\n$53.0 million\nis outstanding under the facility.\nAs of\nDecember 31, 2016\n,\n7.1%\nof the Fund\u2019s assets consisted of cash and cash equivalents.  The Fund invested its assets in venture loans during the year ended\nDecember 31, 2016\nand period from August 12, 2015, commencement of operations, through\nDecember 31, 2015\n.  Amounts disbursed under the Fund\u2019s loan commitments were\n$114.2 million\nand\n$28.6 million\nfor the year ended\nDecember 31, 2016\nand the period from August 12, 2015, commencement of operations, through\nDecember 31, 2015\n, respectively. Net loan amounts outstanding after amortization as of\nDecember 31, 2016\nand\n2015\nwere approximately\n$125.6 million\nand\n$26.2 million\n, respectively.  Unexpired unfunded commitments as of\nDecember 31, 2016\nand\n2015\nwere approximately\n$53.4 million\nand\n$17.7 million\n, respectively.\n18\nPeriod Ended\nCumulative Amount Disbursed\nPrincipal Amortization\nBalance Outstanding\u2013 Fair Value\nUnexpired\nUnfunded Commitments\nDecember 31, 2016\n$142.8 million\n$17.2 million\n$125.6 million\n$53.4 million\nDecember 31, 2015*\n$28.6 million\n$2.4 million\n$26.2 million\n$17.7 million\n* From August 12, 2015, commencement of operations, through December 31, 2015\nBecause venture loans are privately negotiated transactions, investments in these assets are relatively illiquid. It is the Fund\u2019s experience that not all unfunded commitments will be used by borrowers.\nThe Fund seeks to meet the requirements to qualify for the special pass-through status available to RICs under the Internal Revenue Code, and thus to be relieved of federal income tax on that part of its net investment income and realized capital gains that it distributes to its shareholder.  To qualify as a RIC, the Fund must distribute to its shareholder for each taxable year at least 90% of its investment company taxable income (consisting generally of net investment income and net short-term capital gain) (\u201cDistribution Requirement\u201d).  To the extent that the terms of the Fund\u2019s venture loans provide for the receipt by the Fund of additional interest at the end of the loan term or provide for the receipt by the Fund of a purchase price for the asset at the end of the loan term (\u201cresidual income\u201d), the Fund would be required to accrue such residual income over the life of the loan, and to include such accrued income in its gross income for each taxable year even if it receives no portion of such residual income in that year.  Thus, in order to meet the Distribution Requirement and avoid payment of income taxes or an excise tax on undistributed income, the Fund may be required in a particular year to distribute as a dividend an amount in excess of the total amount of income it actually receives.  Those distributions will be made from the Fund's cash assets, from amounts received through amortization of loans or from borrowed funds.\nAs of\nDecember 31, 2016\n, the Fund has adequate cash reserves of\n$9.8 million\nand approximately\n$50.2 million\nin scheduled loan receivable payments over the next year.  Additionally, the Fund has access to uncalled capital of\n$307.1\nmillion as a liquidity source and a borrowing base that continues to grow as we fund additional commitments.  These amounts are sufficient to meet the current commitment backlog and operational expenses of the Fund over the next year.  The Fund constantly evaluates potential future liquidity resources and demands before making additional future commitments.","74":"ITEM 7.\nManagement\u2019s Discussion And Analysis Of Financial Condition And Results Of Operations\nThe following discussion provides information about the results of operations, financial condition, liquidity, and capital resources of the Company and its wholly-owned subsidiary, the Bank. This information is intended to facilitate the understanding and assessment of significant changes and trends related to our financial condition and the results of operations. This discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes presented elsewhere in this Annual Report.\nExecutive Summary\nThis summary is intended to identify the most important matters on which management focuses when it evaluates the financial condition and performance of the Bank. When evaluating financial condition and performance, management looks at certain key metrics and measures. The Bank\u2019s evaluation includes comparisons with peer group financial institutions and its own performance objectives established in internal planning processes.\nThe primary activity of the Bank is commercial banking, as it has been since the Bank opened in Guam in 1972. The Company\u2019s operations are located entirely in the U.S. territories, the U.S.-affiliated nations of the western Pacific, and in the San Francisco Bay area of California. The largest community in the Bank\u2019s western Pacific market is Guam, followed by the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands. The market includes a number of transportation-, travel- and tourism-related companies in the region, as well as substantial U.S. Department of Defense and other U.S. federal government activities in Guam. The Company\u2019s customers are primarily transnational corporations, governments, closely-held businesses and individuals.\nDuring 2016, there were two significant factors that impacted the Company\u2019s financial condition and operations.\n\u2022\nOver the course of the year, tourist arrivals continued to increase in Guam and other islands in the region. In Guam, the number of visitors reached its highest level in history, at 1.54 million. This was due, in part, to the fact that a moderate, 3.5% decrease in Japanese arrivals was more than offset by increasing arrivals from South Korea and China, with the latter two increasing by 27.4% and 14.0%, respectively. The continuing growth in Guam\u2019s tourism industry and increasing arrivals in the other islands led to modest improvements in payroll employment and other aspects of the regional economy, enhancing the Bank\u2019s business.\n\u2022\nThe continuing strength of the economy in the San Francisco Bay area provided ample opportunities to expand the Bank\u2019s business there, leading to an increase of 17.4% in the California region\u2019s loan portfolio, supplementing 5.7% growth in loans in the Guam market and supporting overall growth of 9.8% in the total loan portfolio. The 24.4% growth in the Bank\u2019s asset base supported a 9.8% expansion of our gross loan portfolio and an increase of 57.3% in our investment portfolio.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2016, net income per common share was $13.5 million, or $1.46 per diluted common share. For the year ended December 31, 2015, net income was $11.3 million, or $1.25 per diluted common share. For the year ended December 31, 2014, net income was $9.6 million, or $1.08 per diluted common share.\nThe return on average assets and average equity for the year ended December 31, 2016, were 0.77% and 11.18%, respectively, compared to 0.74% and 10.50%, respectively, for 2015, and 0.66% and 9.78%, respectively, for 2014.\nThe following are major factors that impacted the Company\u2019s results of operations.\n\u2022\nNet interest income increased 8.1% to $73.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2016, from $67.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2015, due to a $5.7 million increase in interest income that was partially offset by an increase of $249 thousand in interest expense. Net interest income increased by 8.3% to $67.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2015, from $62.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2014, due to a $3.3 million increase in interest income and a reduction of $1.9 million in interest expense.\n\u2022\nThe net interest margin decreased 26 basis points to 4.40% for the year ended December 31, 2016, compared with 4.66% for the year ended December 31, 2015. The decrease in the net interest margin for 2016 compared to 2015 was primarily due to a 12 basis point decrease in the average yields on loans and a 13 basis point decline in the average yield on our securities portfolio, partially offset by a 20 basis point increase in the average yield on our deposits with other financial institutions and by a 2 basis point decrease in the average rates that we paid on deposits. Despite the decrease in the overall average yield of 27 basis points on our total earning assets, higher loan and investment volumes generated higher interest income that more than offset the higher gross amount of interest paid on our customers\u2019 deposits. The net interest margin increased 15 basis points to 4.66% for the year ended December 31, 2015, compared with 4.52% for the year ended December 31, 2014. The increase in the net interest margin for 2015 compared to 2014 was primarily due to a 32\n23\nbasis point decrease in the yields on loans and a 13 basis point decline in the yield on our securities portfolio, partially offset by a 19 basis point decrease in ra\ntes paid on deposits. Despite the decrease in average yields, higher loan volumes generated higher interest income that more than offset the lower average yield on a smaller investment securities portfolio.\n\u2022\nThe provision for loan losses was $3.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2016, $600 thousand lower than the provision during the previous year. The provision for loan losses was $4.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2015, included $12 thousand assigned to the reserve for off-balance sheet risk, and was approximately the same as the $4.5 million provision for the year ended December 31, 2014, The $4.5 million provision for the year ended December 31, 2014, reflects a supplemental provision of $565 thousand during the third quarter, primarily in response to the charge-off of two loans in the amount of $1.6 million, tempered by a decrease of $637 thousand in nonperforming loans despite growth of $107.1 million in on our loan portfolio, as well as management\u2019s assessment of economic conditions.\n\u2022\nNon-interest income was $13.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2016, $2.9 million more than the $11.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2015. The increase in non-interest income in 2016 compared to 2015 was primarily due to increases of $1.2 million in income from merchant services, $911 thousand from service charges and fees, $328 thousand in trustee fees and $325 thousand in net gains on investment securities, partially offset by a reduction of $134 thousand in income from cardholders. The increase in merchant income was the result of a correction of accumulated billing errors by our card processor. Non-interest income was $11.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2015, $179 thousand more than the $10.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2014. The increase in non-interest income in 2015 compared to 2014 was primarily due to increases of $566 thousand in revenues from cardholders and $356 thousand from service charges and fees in 2015, partially offset by reductions of $431 thousand in income from merchant services and $395 thousand in net investment securities gains from the previous year.\n\u2022\nNon-interest expense was $64.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2016, compared to $59.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2015. The increase of 8.6%, primarily due to an increase of $3.1 million in salaries and employee benefits, an additional $1.3 million in general, administrative and other expenses, and a rise of $807 thousand in equipment and depreciation expense. These increases were partially offset by a reduction of $264 thousand in the expense associated with other real estate that we owned, primarily foreclosed properties. Non-interest expense was $59.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2015, compared to $55.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2014. The increase of 6.1%, primarily due to an increase of $2.3 million in salaries and employee benefits, an additional $667 thousand in general, administrative and other expenses, a rise of $310 thousand in training and education expense and $226 thousand more in equipment and depreciation expense. These increases were partially offset by a reduction of $412 thousand in occupancy expense.\n\u2022\nThe 19.6% increase of net after tax income to $13.5 million in 2016 compared to $11.3 million 2015 was due to the $5.5 million increase in net interest income and the $2.9 million increase in non-interest income, offset by the $5.1 million increase in non-interest expense and the increase of $1.7 million in income taxes. The 18.1% increase of net after tax income to $11.3 million in 2015 compared to $9.6 million 2014 was due to a $5.2 million increase in net interest income and a $179 thousand increase in non-interest income, offset by a $3.4 million increase in non-interest expense and an increase of $310 thousand in income taxes.\nThe following are important factors in understanding our current financial condition and liquidity position.\n\u2022\nCash, interest-bearing deposits in other financial institutions, and investment securities available-for-sale collectively increased by 81.7%, to $596.5 million, at December 31, 2016, from $328.3 million at December 31, 2015. This increase in liquid assets is primarily due to an increase of $356.0 million in deposits and $1.2 million in other liabilities, plus an increase of $9.8 million in retained earnings, $8.8 million in additional paid-in capital for preferred stock and $980 thousand in proceeds from newly issued preferred stock, partially offset by a $103.8 million increase in net loans, $5.8 million in other assets, and a $3.1 million investment in a new, unconsolidated subsidiary. The increase in total loans (net of deferred fees and the allowance for loan losses) of $103.8 million, or 9.8%, to $1.16 billion at December 31, 2016, compared to $1.05 billion at December 31, 2015, is primarily attributable to an increase of $91.7 million in commercial loans, to $807.5 million at December 31, 2016, from $715.8 million at December 31, 2015. In addition, consumer loans, including residential mortgage loans, increased by $13.7 million, to $368.5 million, at December 31, 2016, from $354.8 million at December 31, 2015.\n\u2022\nClassified assets decreased to $20.4 million at December 31, 2016, compared to $25.3 million at December 31, 2015.\n\u2022\nThe allowance for loan losses at December 31, 2016, was $15.4 million, or 1.31% of total gross loans. The allowance for loan losses at December 31, 2015, was $14.2 million, or 1.32% of total gross loans.\n\u2022\nNonperforming loans decreased by $4.0 million to $6.8 million, or 0.58% of total gross loans, at December 31, 2016, from $10.8 million, or 1.01% of total gross loans, at December 31, 2015.\n24\n\u2022\nNet loan charge-offs were $2.6 million duri\nng the year ended December 31, 2016, as compared to the $2.9 million in net charge-offs for the year ended December 31, 2015.\n\u2022\nThe ratio of noncore funding of $43.8 million (which consists of $100,000 and over time deposits plus short-term borrowings) to total assets was 2.28% at December 31, 2016, compared to $37.0 million, or 2.40% of total assets, at December 31, 2015.\n\u2022\nThe loan-to-deposit ratio decreased to 66.1% at December 31, 2016, as compared to 75.3% at December 31, 2015, due to deposit growth of $356.0 million far exceeding the $105.4 million increase in total gross loans.\n\u2022\nCapital ratios significantly exceed regulatory requirements for a well-capitalized financial institution, both at the Company level and in the Bank. The leverage ratio at the Company was 7.06%, with a Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of 11.36%, a total risk-based capital ratio of 12.61%, and a common equity Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of 10.93% at December 31, 2016. The leverage ratio at the Company was 7.40%, with a Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of 11.20%, a total risk-based capital ratio of 12.45% and a common equity Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of 11.20% at December 31, 2015. The regulatory well-capitalized guidelines are a minimum of a 5% leverage ratio, a 8% Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio, a 10% total risk-based capital ratio, and a 6.5% common equity Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio. The changes in our capital ratios from December 31, 2015, to December 31, 2016, was due to the retention of $9.8 million in earnings during 2016, along with the issuance of preferred stock in the amount of $9.8 million.\nDeposits\nThe composition and cost of the Bank\u2019s deposit base are important in analyzing the Bank\u2019s net interest margin and balance sheet liquidity characteristics. The Bank\u2019s depositors are generally located in its primary market area. Depending on loan demand and other funding requirements, the Bank also attracts deposits through its interest rate pricing. The Bank monitors all deposits that may be sensitive to interest rate changes to help ensure that liquidity risk does not become excessive due to deposit migration. Deposits at December 31, 2016, were $1.78 billion, compared to $1.42 billion at December 31, 2015. The 25.0% increase was primarily due to the acquisition of additional government and commercial accounts in the Freely Associated States, U.S. government payments for land use and other purposes, and the growth in Guam\u2019s tourism and defense sectors, although the Bank\u2019s deposits also increased in the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands and in the California region.\nThe Bank does not currently accept brokered deposits because it already maintains ample liquidity.\nLiquidity\nOur liquidity position refers to our ability to maintain cash flows sufficient to fund operations and to meet obligations and other commitments in a timely fashion. We believe that the Bank\u2019s liquidity position is more than sufficient to meet our operating expenses, borrowing needs and other obligations for 2017, and management has tested and determined that, even under severely stressed scenarios, the Bank\u2019s liquidity will be more than adequate to meet our requirements. Our liquidity increased substantially during 2016. Once the increases in our loan portfolio and other assets were accommodated, the increases in our liabilities and equity were channeled into short-term earning assets as a defensive measure due to historically low interest rates and yields, and the possibility that those rates and yields will increase as the U.S. economy continues to improve. At December 31, 2016, we had $176.7 million in cash and cash equivalents and approximately $159.2 million in available borrowing capacity from various sources, including the Federal Home Loan Bank (\u201cFHLB\u201d), the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco (\u201cFRB\u201d), and Federal Funds facilities with several financial institutions. The Bank also had $199.7 million in unpledged securities available at December 31, 2016. Our loan-to-deposit ratio decreased to 66.1% at December 31, 2016, compared to 75.3% at December 31, 2015, as our gross loans increased by 9.8% and our deposits grew by 25.0%.\nLending\nOur loans originate almost entirely through the branch offices located in our primary market. As the Bank has approached a saturation point in our island service area, we have expanded our activities in California through our branch in San Francisco. The total loan portfolio remains well diversified with commercial and industrial loans accounting for 21.1% and commercial real estate loans accounting for 47.0% of the total loan portfolio at December 31, 2016. Construction loans fell from 5.8% of the portfolio at December 31, 2015, to 0.5% at December 31, 2016. Residential mortgages and other consumer-related loans accounted for the remaining 31.3% of total loans at December 31, 2016. The increase in gross loans in 2016 compared to 2015 was primarily due to an increase of 12.8% in our commercial loan portfolio, including a 42.5% expansion of our lending in the Freely Associated States of Micronesia and a rise of 15.6% in California, supplemented by growth of 3.9% in consumer loans. The Bank also had a decrease of $2.2 million in loans sold to the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation (\u201cFreddie Mac\u201d) from $213.2 million at December 31,\n25\n2015, to $211.0 million at December 31, 2016, but these loans are off-book, except for the value of the associated mortgage servicing rights. The Bank exercises careful selectivity with respect\nto the types of loans it chooses to originate.\nNet Interest Income\nThe management of interest income and expense is fundamental to the performance of the Company and the Bank. Net interest income, the difference between interest income and interest expense, is the largest component of the Bank\u2019s total revenue. Management closely monitors both total net interest income and the net interest margin (net interest income divided by average earning assets).\nThe Bank, through its asset and liability management policies and practices, as overseen by its Asset and Liability Committee, seeks to maximize net interest income without exposing itself to an excessive level of interest rate risk. Interest rate risk is managed by monitoring the pricing, maturity and repricing options of all classes of interest bearing assets and liabilities. This is discussed in more detail under Liquidity and Asset\/Liability Management. In addition, as the market allows, we take measures and initiatives to improve our net interest margin, including increasing loan rates, maintaining interest rate floors on floating rate loans, reducing nonperforming assets, managing deposit interest rates and reducing higher-cost deposits.\nFrom January 22, 2008, through December 16, 2008, the Federal Reserve\u2019s Open Market Committee reduced its target short-term interest rates by 325 basis points, to a range of 0.00% to 0.25%, in response to the credit crisis and economic downturn that resulted from the collapse in the U.S. housing market and the subsequent global recession. The target Federal Funds Rate was raised to a range of 0.25% to 0.50% on December 16, 2015, then again to a range of 0.50% to 0\/75% on December 15, 2016. The increase in short-term rates will gradually affect the rates applicable to many of the Bank\u2019s loans. The increase in short-term interest rates raised the overall cost of interest bearing deposits, which represent the Bank\u2019s primary funding source, by 4.4% by the end of 2016, as they tend to re-price more slowly than floating rate loans. The continuing low level of short-term interest rates, including the prime rate, has significantly compressed the Bank\u2019s net interest margin, but that pressure is gradually being eased.\nManagement of Credit Risk\nWe continue to proactively identify, quantify and manage our problem loans. Early identification of problem loans and potential future losses helps enable us to resolve credit issues with potentially less risk and lower ultimate losses. We maintain an allowance for loan losses in an amount that we believe is adequate to absorb probable and projected incurred losses in the portfolio. While we strive to carefully monitor and manage credit quality and to identify loans that may be deteriorating, circumstances can change at any time that may result in future losses for loans included in the portfolio, that as of the date of the financial statements have not yet been identified as potential problem loans. Through established credit practices, we adjust the allowance for loan losses accordingly. However, because future events are uncertain, there may be loans that deteriorate, some of which could occur in an accelerated time frame. As a result, future additions to the allowance may be necessary. Because the loan portfolio contains a number of commercial loans, commercial real estate and construction loans with relatively large balances, deterioration in the credit quality of one or more of these loans may require a significant increase to the allowance for loan losses. Future additions to the allowance may also be required based on changes in the financial condition of borrowers, such as have resulted due to changing economic conditions. Additionally, federal and local banking regulators throughout our market area, as an integral part of their supervisory function, periodically review our allowance for loan losses. These regulatory agencies may require us to recognize further loan loss provisions or charge-offs based upon their judgments, which may be different from ours. Any increase in the allowance for loan losses may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operation.\nWe also maintain a reserve against potential credit risks associated with our unfunded off-balance sheet loan commitments.\nFurther discussion of the management of credit risk appears under \u201c\nProvision for Loan Losses\n\u201d and \u201c\nAllowance for Loan Losses\n\u201d.\nNon-Interest Income\nWhile net interest income remains the largest single component of total revenues, non-interest income is an important source, as well. In total, the Bank received $13.9 million in non-interest income during 2016, an increase of $2.9 million from the $11.0 million recorded for 2015, and more than the $10.8 million received in 2014. The increase from 2015 to 2016 was due in part to growth in income from merchant services, as well as increases in service fees and charges, trustee fees and net gains on investment securities by $1.2million, $911 thousand, $328 thousand and $325 thousand, respectively, for 2016 in comparison to 2015. The increase in merchant services income resulted in part from the correction of a cumulative billing error by a service provider, while the increase in service charges and fees derived from an increase in service charges on low-volume savings accounts.\n26\nNon-Interest E\nxpense\nManagement considers the control of operating expenses to be a critical element of the performance of the Company and the Bank. Over the last several years, the Bank has undertaken initiatives to contain its non-interest expense and improve its efficiency. Nevertheless, total non-interest expense was $64.1 million for year ended December 31, 2016, compared to $59.0 million for year ended December 31, 2015, an increase of $5.1 million. This increase was largely the result of increasing costs associated with salaries and employee benefits, from $28.5 million in 2015 to $31.6 million in 2016, higher general administrative and other expenses and the rise in equipment and depreciation expense, which increased by $1.3 million and $807 thousand, respectively. Operating expenses in 2015 were $3.4 million higher than in 2014, primarily due to a $2.3 million increase in expenses associated with salaries and employee benefits, a $667 thousand increase in general, administrative and other expenses, and a $310 thousand rise in training and education expense, partially offset by a reduction of $412 thousand in occupancy expense. For both 2015 and 2016, the increase in operating expenses was primarily the result of organic growth in the size of the Bank.\nCapital Management\nAs part of its asset and liability management process, the Company continually assesses its capital position to take into consideration growth, expected earnings, risk profile and potential corporate activities that it may choose to pursue.\nDuring the past several years, the Bank\u2019s principal source of increases in capital has been retained earnings, supplemented by stock purchases through our Employee Stock Purchase Plan. See Note 14 of\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\nin Item 15 of this Annual Report for a description of the Employee Stock Purchase Plan. Since the end of 2010, though, the Bank\u2019s assets have grown by 94.0%, and those more traditional sources of additional capital have not kept pace.\nAlthough the Bank remains \u201cwell capitalized\u201d by all four regulatory measures of capital adequacy, the Bank\u2019s Tier-1 ratio had been decreasing because of its rapid asset growth, primarily attributed to the substantial growth in customer deposits. Consequently, the Company was engaged in placing an additional $2.8 million of its common stock as of December 31, 2015, and placed $9.8 million in non-cumulative perpetual preferred stock during 2016.\nIn these offerings, the Company issued its stock to certain \"accredited investors\" within the meaning of Rule 501 of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the \"Securities Act\"), at a purchase price of $9.85 per common share in 2015 and a purchase price of $1,000.00 per preferred share in 2016 (the \"Offerings\"). These are restricted shares, which may not be resold for a period of two years. The terms of the offerings were set forth in their respective Stock Purchase Agreements, dated July 30, 2015, and September 28, 2016, entered into between the Company and each investor. A portion of the proceeds from the offerings was used to retire subordinated debt, while the remainder will allow the Company to\nsupport the continued organic growth of its banking subsidiary in its existing market areas and\nwill enable us to further serve the needs of individuals and businesses in those markets.\nThe Company's common and preferred stock was offered and sold only to investors that met the \"accredited investor\" definition of Rule 501 of the Securities Act in reliance on the exemption from registration afforded under Section 4(2) of the Securities Act and Rule 504 of Regulation D under the Securities Act. The common stock offered in the Offerings has not been registered under the Securities Act or state securities laws, and may not be offered or sold in the United States without being registered with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the \"SEC\") or through an applicable exemption from SEC registration requirements.\nResults of Operations\nThe Bank earns income from two primary sources. The first is net interest income, which is interest income generated by earning assets less interest expense on interest-bearing liabilities. The second is non-interest income, which primarily consists of service charges and fees, income from merchants for processing credit and debit card transactions, non-interest income from holders of the Bank\u2019s credit cards, trustee fees and net investment securities gains. The majority of the Company\u2019s non-interest expenses are operating costs that relate to providing a full range of banking services to our customers.\nNet Interest Income and Net Interest Margin\nThe level of net interest income depends on several factors in combination, including earning assets, yields on earning assets, the cost of interest-bearing liabilities, and the relative volumes of earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities. To maintain its net interest margin, the Bank must manage the relationship between interest earned and interest paid.\n27\nDistribution, Rate and Yield\nThe following Distribution, Rate and Yield table presents the average amounts outstanding during 2016 and 2015 for the major categories of the Company\u2019s balance sheet, the average interest rates earned or paid thereon, and the resulting net interest margin on average interest earning assets for the periods indicated. Average balances are based on monthly averages.\nYears Ended December 31,\n2016\n2015\nAverage\nBalance\nInterest Earned\/Paid\nAverage Yield\/Rate\nAverage\nBalance\nInterest Earned\/Paid\nAverage Yield\/Rate\nInterest earning assets.\nShort term investments\n1\n$129,791\n$493\n0.38%\n$92,383\n$164\n0.18%\nInvestment Securities2\n406,101\n5,141\n1.27%\n327,479\n4,580\n1.40%\nLoans3\n1,135,736\n69,914\n6.16%\n1,036,587\n65,061\n6.28%\nTotal earning assets\n1,671,628\n75,548\n4.52%\n1,456,449\n69,805\n4.79%\nNoninterest earning assets\n79,723\n76,243\nTotal Assets\n$1,751,351\n$1,532,692\nInterest-bearing liabilities.\nInterest-bearing checking\naccounts\n$222,786\n$249\n0.11%\n$158,832\n$181\n0.11%\nMoney market and savings\naccounts\n882,756\n1,587\n0.18%\n795,794\n1,550\n0.19%\nCertificates of deposit\n43,095\n142\n0.33%\n51,419\n163\n0.32%\nOther borrowings\n2,115\n165\n7.80%\n-\n-\nTotal interest-bearing\nliabilities\n1,150,752\n1,978\n0.17%\n1,006,045\n1,894\n0.19%\nNon-interest bearing\nliabilities\n479,823\n419,148\nTotal Liabilities\n1,630,575\n1,425,193\nStockholders\u2019 equity\n120,776\n107,499\nTotal Liabilities and\nStockholders\u2019\nEquity\n$1,751,351\n$1,532,692\nNet interest income\n$73,570\n$67,911\nInterest rate spread\n4.35%\n4.60%\nNet interest margin\n4.40%\n4.66%\n1\nIncludes interest bearing deposit balances we maintain with other financial institutions and the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco.\n2\nIncludes all investment securities in the Available-for-Sale and the Held-to-Maturity classifications.\n3\nIncludes average balances of non-accrual loans.\nThe Distribution, Rate and Yield table above sets forth the dollar amounts in interest earned and paid for each major category of interest earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities for the noted periods, as well as their respective yields and costs, and the resulting interest rate spreads and net interest margins.\nThe Bank\u2019s net interest margin, expressed as a percentage of average earning assets, was 4.40% for 2016, down 26 basis points from 4.66% for 2015, even though average earning assets increased by 14.8% during the year, from $1.46 billion in 2015 to $1.67 billion in 2016. The primary reason for the decrease in the net interest margin was that our funding cost increased by 4.4%, from $1.9 million in 2015 to $2.0 million in 2016. Our average loan balances increased by $99.1 million, or 9.6%, but the average yield on the entire loan portfolio decreased by 12 basis points so that interest earnings on loans increased by only $4.9 million, or 7.5%. Re-pricing of existing loans to lower interest rates during 2016, as well as new loans made in a more competitive environment, caused the decrease in the average yield on the loan portfolio. Yields on our investment securities portfolio decreased by 13 basis points, so the yield on average earning assets decreased from 4.79% to 4.52% from 2015 to 2016. Average total interest-bearing liabilities increased by 14.4% during 2016, to $1.15 billion from $1.01billion the previous year.\nNet interest income for the year ended December 31, 2016, increased by $5.7 million, to $73.6 million, compared to $67.9 million a year earlier, primarily due to an increase in interest income derived from the growth in average loan balances, supplemented by increases in earnings on our investment securities portfolio and our short term deposits in other banks, including the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco. Net interest income for 2015 increased by $5.2 million from 2014, primarily due to an increase in interest\n28\nincome derived from the gro\nwth in average loan balances and a reduction in interest paid on money market and savings deposits, partially offset by a decrease in earnings on our investment securities portfolio. The Bank\u2019s net interest margin was 4.66% in 2015, compared to 4.52% in 20\n14, an increase of 15 basis points.\nA substantial portion of the Bank\u2019s earning assets are variable-rate loans that re-price when the Bank\u2019s reference rate, which usually corresponds with the New York prime lending rate, is changed. This is in contrast to a large base of core deposits that are generally slower to re-price. This causes the Bank\u2019s balance sheet to be liability-sensitive, which means that, all else being equal, net interest margin will be lower during periods when short-term interest rates are rising and higher when rates are falling. However, we will not necessarily have to raise rates on the personal savings portion of our core deposits as general market interest rates increase, mitigating the sensitivity of our net interest margin to rising interest rates.\nProvision for Loan Losses\nCredit risk is inherent in the lending business. The Bank establishes an allowance for loan losses through charges to earnings, which are shown in the statements of income as the provision for loan losses. Specifically identifiable and quantifiable known losses are promptly charged off against the allowance. The provision for loan losses is allocated monthly and evaluated quarterly through a determination of the adequacy of the Bank\u2019s allowance for loan losses, and reset if necessary, charging the shortfall, if any, to the current quarter\u2019s expense. This has the effect of creating variability in the amount and frequency of charges to the Bank\u2019s earnings. The provision for loan losses and level of allowance for each period are dependent upon many factors, including loan growth, net charge-offs, changes in the composition of the loan portfolio, delinquencies, management\u2019s assessment of the quality of the loan portfolio, the valuation of problem loans and the general economic conditions in the Bank\u2019s market area.\nFor 2016, the Bank had a provision for loan and credit losses of $3.9 million, which included $6 thousand assigned to the reserve for unfunded credit commitments. The remaining 2016 provision was $594 thousand less than the provision for 2015, and lower than the provision of $4.5 million for 2014. The 2016 provision is deemed by management to provide a sufficient allowance for loan losses due to net losses during the year, as well as to maintain the allowance for loan losses at a level that is adequate to absorb all reasonably expected future losses and to reflect management\u2019s perception of risk in the existing loan portfolio, as well as improvements in the quality of that portfolio. The 2015 provision for loan losses, a decrease of $52 thousand compared to 2014 reflects the write-down of two commercial loans by $1.6 million against the allowance for loan losses in the third and fourth quarters of 2014 and raised the monthly provision in the fourth quarter of that year to cover the risk associated with growth in our loan portfolio.\nThe allowance for loan losses represented 1.31%, 1.32% and 1.28% of total gross loans at December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively. Provisions for loan losses are charged to operating income to bring the allowance for loan losses to a level deemed appropriate by the Bank based on the factors discussed under \u201c\nAllowance for Loan Losses.\n\u201d\nNon-interest income\nThe following table sets forth the various components of the Company\u2019s non-interest income.\nYears Ended December 31,\nIncrease (decrease) 2016\nversus 2015\nIncrease (decrease) 2015\nversus 2014\n2016\n2015\n2014\nAmount\nPercent\nAmount\nPercent\n(Dollars in thousands)\nNon-interest Income\nService charges and fees\n$5,824\n$4,913\n$4,557\n$911\n18.5%\n$356\n7.8%\nInvestment securities gains, net\n401\n76\n471\n325\n427.6%\n(395\n)\n-83.9%\nIncome from merchants\n2,108\n903\n1,334\n1,205\n133.4%\n(431\n)\n-32.3%\nIncome from cardholders\n1,754\n1,888\n1,322\n(134\n)\n-7.1%\n566\n42.8%\nTrustee fees\n911\n583\n492\n328\n56.3%\n91\n18.5%\nOther income\n2,894\n2,629\n2,637\n265\n10.1%\n(8\n)\n-0.3%\nTotal non-interest income\n$13,892\n$10,992\n$10,813\n$2,900\n26.4%\n$179\n1.7%\nTotal non-interest income in 2016 was $2.9 million, or 26.4%, higher than in 2015, primarily because of a sharp increase of $1.2 million, or 133.4%, in income from merchant services due to the correction of accumulated billing errors by a vendor, the on-boarding of new merchant customers subsequent to the closure of a competing merchant services provider in Guam and an increase in net residuals that resulted from a reduction in cross-border fees; an increase of $911 thousand in service charges and fees that resulted from the full implementation of a fee to offset the costs of low-balance savings accounts; an increase of $328 thousand in trustee fees generated by increased revenue sharing in the higher interest rate environment; and a $325 thousand increase in net gains on the sale of investment securities. Other sources of non-interest income include loan servicing fees and income from the Bank-owned life\n29\ninsurance policies. The proportional composition of non-interest income remained relatively consta\nnt, with the increase in income from merchants being the only change exceeding 5.0% of the respective year\u2019s total from 2015 to 2016. Total non-interest income in 2015 was $179 thousand higher than in 2014, primarily because of a sharp decrease of $431 tho\nusand, or 32.3%, in income from merchant services due to lower settlement fees and higher processing fees and a $395 thousand decrease in net gains on the sale of investment securities, somewhat more than offset by a $566 thousand increase in income from c\nardholders and a $356 thousand increase in income from service charges and fees.\nNon-interest expense\nThe following table sets forth the various components of the Company\u2019s non-interest expense.\n2016 vs. 2015\n2015 vs. 2014\n2016\n2015\n$Variance%\nVariance\n2014\n$Variance%\nVariance\nNon-Interest Expense.\nSalaries & employee benefits\n$31,618\n$28,473\n$3,145\n11.05%\n$26,133\n$2,340\n8.95%\nOccupancy\n6,329\n6,554\n(225\n)\n-3.43%\n6,966\n(412\n)\n-5.91%\nEquipment and depreciation\n7,382\n6,575\n807\n12.27%\n6,349\n226\n3.56%\nInsurance\n1,625\n1,680\n(55\n)\n-3.27%\n1,678\n2\n0.12%\nTelecommunications\n1,647\n1,527\n120\n7.86%\n1,488\n39\n2.62%\nFDIC insurance assessment\n1,325\n1,259\n66\n5.24%\n1,220\n39\n3.20%\nProfessional services\n1,999\n1,757\n242\n13.77%\n1,748\n9\n0.51%\nContract services\n1,607\n1,825\n(218\n)\n-11.95%\n1,694\n131\n7.73%\nOther real estate owned\n133\n397\n(264\n)\n-66.50%\n297\n100\n33.67%\nStationery & supplies\n926\n747\n179\n23.96%\n826\n(79\n)\n-9.56%\nTraining & education\n1,025\n1,046\n(21\n)\n-2.01%\n736\n310\n42.12%\nGeneral, administrative & other\n8,513\n7,207\n1,306\n18.12%\n6,546\n661\n10.10%\nTotal Non-Interest\nExpenses\n$64,129\n$59,047\n$5,082\n8.61%\n$55,681\n$3,366\n6.05%\nNon-interest expense by Category.

This increase is primarily attributed to the $3.1 million increase in salaries & employee benefits, up by 11.0% from th\ne year ended December 31, 2015, due to merit raises and increases in some benefits expenses, as well as an increase in the number of employees necessary to accommodate the expansion of the Bank\u2019s operations. In addition, general, administrative and other e\nxpenses increased by $1.3 million and our equipment and depreciation expense increased by $807 thousand. These increases were partially offset by modest decreases in the expenses associated with other real estate that is owned by the Bank, occupancy expens\ne and contract services expense.\nIn 2015, total non-interest expense increased by $3.4 million to $59.0 million, as compared to $55.7 million in 2014. This increase is primarily attributed to the $2.3 million increase in salaries & employee benefits, up by 9.0% from the year ended December 31, 2014, due to an extra pay period during the year, merit raises and increases in some benefits expenses. In addition, general, administrative and other expenses increased by $661 thousand, our training and education expense increased by $310 thousand and our equipment and depreciation expense increased by $226 thousand. These increases were partially offset by the $412 thousand decrease in occupancy expenses.\nIncome Tax Expense\nThe Company computes its provision for income taxes on a monthly basis. The effective tax rate is determined by applying the Bank\u2019s statutory income tax rate to pre-tax book income, as adjusted for permanent differences between pre-tax book income and actual taxable income. These permanent differences include, but are not limited to, tax-exempt interest income, increases in the cash surrender value of life insurance policies, certain expenses that are not allowed as tax deductions, and tax credits.\nThe Bank pays income taxes in Guam and the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands under a territorial \u201cmirror\u201d of the U.S. Internal Revenue Code, with payments made to the respective territorial governments instead of the U.S. Treasury; there is no equivalent of a state income tax in either of these jurisdictions. The Bank also pays taxes to the governments of the Republic of Palau, the Federated States of Micronesia, the Republic of the Marshall Islands and the State of California. The Bank\u2019s territorial and state income tax expense in 2016 was $5.8 million, as compared to an income tax expense of $4.1 million in 2015 and $3.8 million in 2014.\nThe difference in the effective tax rate compared to the combined territorial, foreign and state statutory tax rates of 34% is primarily the result of the Bank\u2019s portfolio of tax-exempt loans to the government of Guam totaling $30.3 million and $47.1 million at December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively.\nSome items of income and expense are recognized in different years for tax purposes than when applying generally accepted accounting principles, leading to timing differences between the Bank\u2019s actual tax liability and the amount accrued for this liability based on book income. These temporary differences comprise the \u201cdeferred\u201d portion of the Bank\u2019s tax expense or benefit, which is accumulated on the Bank\u2019s books as a deferred tax asset or deferred tax liability until such time as they reverse. At the end of 2016 and 2015, the Bank had a gross deferred tax asset of $7.5 million and $9.8 million, respectively.\nRealization of the net deferred tax asset is primarily dependent upon the Bank generating sufficient taxable income to obtain a benefit from the reversal of net deductible temporary differences, utilization of tax credit carry-forwards and the net operating loss carry-forwards for Guam, the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands and California state income tax purposes. The amount of deferred tax assets considered realizable is subject to adjustment in future periods based on estimates of future taxable income. Under generally accepted accounting principles, a valuation allowance is required to be recognized if it is \u201cmore likely than not\u201d that a deferred tax asset will not be realized. The determination of whether the deferred tax assets will actually be realized is highly subjective and dependent upon judgment concerning management\u2019s evaluation of both positive and negative evidence, including forecasts of future income, cumulative losses, applicable tax planning strategies, and assessments of current and future economic and business conditions.\nIn assessing the realization of deferred tax assets at December 31, 2016, based on these factors, the Bank believed that it was more likely than not that the Bank will realize only $8.1 million of the benefits of these deductible differences. Therefore, a valuation allowance of $3.2 million for its deferred tax asset was recorded at December 31, 2016.\nIn assessing the realization of deferred tax assets at December 31, 2015, the Bank believed that it was more likely than not that the Bank will realize only $7.0 million of the benefits of these deductible differences. Therefore, a valuation allowance of $2.7 million for the deferred tax asset was recorded at December 31, 2015.\n31\nFinancial Condition\nAs of December 31, 2016, total assets were $1.92 billion, an increase of 24.4% from $1.54 billion at December 31, 2015. Total securities available-for-sale (at fair value) were $419.9 million, an increase of 84.5% from $227.5 million at December 31, 2015. The total loan portfolio, net of allowance for loan losses and deferred fees, was $1.16 billion, an increase of 9.8% from $1.05 billion at year-end 2015. Interest bearing deposits in banks more than doubled during 2016, rising to $150.9 million from $72.3 million at the end of 2015. Total deposits were $1.78 billion, an increase of 25.0% from $1.42 billion at year-end 2015. The Bank had no short-term borrowings at December 31, 2016.\nSecurities Portfolio\nThe following table reflects the estimated fair value of Available-for-Sale securities and the amortized cost of Held-to-Maturity securities, for each category for the past two years.\nInvestment Portfolio\nDecember 31, 2016\nAmortized Cost\nGross\nUnrealized\nGains\nGross\nUnrealized\nLosses\nEstimated Fair Value\nSecurities Available-for-Sale\nU.S. government agency and sponsored enterprise\n(GSE) debt securities\n$125,476\n$6\n$(1,051\n)\n$124,431\nU.S. government agency pool securities\n238,615\n124\n(1,613\n)\n237,126\nU.S. government agency or GSE mortgage-backed\nsecurities\n59,049\n36\n(762\n)\n58,323\nTotal\n$423,140\n$166\n$(3,426\n)\n$419,880\nSecurities Held-to-Maturity\nU.S. government agency and sponsored enterprise\n(GSE) debt securities\n$44,909\n$956\n$(36\n)\n$45,829\nU.S. government agency pool securities\n13,591\n14\n(91\n)\n13,514\nU.S. government agency or GSE mortgage-backed\nsecurities\n37,667\n373\n(320\n)\n37,720\nTotal\n$96,167\n$1,343\n$(447\n)\n$97,063\nDecember 31, 2015\nAmortized Cost\nGross\nUnrealized\nGains\nGross\nUnrealized\nLosses\nEstimated Fair Value\nSecurities Available-for-Sale\nU.S. government agency and sponsored enterprise\n(GSE) debt securities\n$107,070\n$-\n$(1,048\n)\n$106,022\nU.S. government agency pool securities\n51,808\n30\n(934\n)\n50,904\nU.S. government agency or GSE mortgage-backed\nsecurities\n71,562\n44\n(997\n)\n70,609\nTotal\n$230,440\n$74\n$(2,979\n)\n$227,535\nSecurities Held-to-Maturity\nU.S. government agency and sponsored enterprise\n(GSE) debt securities\n$44,638\n$1,055\n$(116\n)\n$45,577\nU.S. government agency pool securities\n16,035\n31\n(47\n)\n16,019\nU.S. government agency or GSE mortgage-backed\nsecurities\n39,846\n613\n(131\n)\n40,328\nTotal\n$100,519\n$1,699\n$(294\n)\n$101,924\n32\nThe amortized cost and fair value of investment securities by contractual maturity at December 31, 2016, are shown below.\nDecember 31, 2016\nAvailable-for-Sale\nHeld-to-Maturity\nAmortized\nCost\nEstimated Fair Value\nAmortized\nCost\nEstimated Fair Value\nDue within one year\n$-\n$-\n$-\n$-\nDue after one but within five years\n131,023\n129,943\n57,761\n58,831\nDue after five but within ten years\n44,787\n44,627\n14,427\n14,609\nDue after ten years\n247,330\n245,310\n23,979\n23,623\nTotal\n$423,140\n$419,880\n$96,167\n$97,063\nThe securities portfolio is the second largest component of the Bank\u2019s interest earning assets, and the structure and composition of this portfolio is important to an analysis of the financial condition of the Bank and the Company. The portfolio serves the following purposes: (i) it provides a source of pledged assets for securing certain deposits and borrowed funds, as may be required by law or by specific agreement with a depositor or lender; (ii) it can be used as an interest rate risk management tool, since it provides a large base of assets, the maturity and interest rate characteristics of which can be changed more readily than the loan portfolio to better match changes in the deposit base and other funding sources of the Bank; and (iii) it is an alternative interest earning use of funds when loan demand is weak or when deposits grow more rapidly than loans.\nEighty-one percent of the Bank\u2019s securities at December 31, 2016, were classified under existing accounting rules as \u201cAvailable-for-Sale\u201d to allow flexibility in the management of the portfolio. Accounting guidance requires Available-for-Sale securities to be marked to fair market value, with an offset to other comprehensive income (loss), a component of stockholders\u2019 equity, recorded on a quarterly basis. The remaining 18.6% of the investment portfolio was in Held-to-Maturity securities, which the Bank is willing and believes it will be able to retain until they mature, and are recorded on an amortized cost basis.\nThe Bank\u2019s portfolio has historically been comprised primarily of: (i) U.S. government agency and sponsored entities\u2019 debt securities for liquidity and pledging; (ii) U.S. government agency and sponsored entities\u2019 mortgage-backed securities, which in many instances can also be used for pledging, and which generally enhance the yield of the portfolio; and (iii) U.S. government agency pool securities, which generally enhance the yield of the portfolio. Since the downgrade of many municipal obligations and their respective insurers in the past few years, the Bank no longer holds municipal bonds, but may do so again when markets become more stable.\nCompared to December 31, 2015, the Bank\u2019s securities portfolio increased by $188.0 million to 26.9% of total assets at December 31, 2016, from 21.2% at December 31, 2015. The Bank decreased its holding of mortgage-back securities by $14.5 million to $96.0 million at December 31, 2016, from $110.5 million at December 31, 2015. During the same period, the Bank\u2019s holdings of U.S. government agency pool securities increased by $183.8 million, to $250.7 million, and its holdings of U.S. government agency and sponsored enterprise debt securities increased by $18.7 million, to $169.3 million. The Bank has not used interest rate swaps or other derivative instruments to hedge fixed rate loans or securities to otherwise mitigate interest rate risk.\nLoans\nThe Bank\u2019s loans represent the largest portion of earning assets, substantially greater than the securities portfolio or any other asset category, and the quality and diversification of the loan portfolio is an important consideration when assessing the financial condition of the Bank and the Company.\nGross loans represented 61.2% of total assets at December 31, 2016, as compared to 69.3% at December 31, 2015. The ratio of gross loans to deposits decreased to 66.1% at the end of 2016 from 75.3% at the end of 2015. Demand for loans has strengthened within the Bank\u2019s California, Guam and Freely Associated States markets due to the improving economic environment, but the Bank has remained selective with respect to the types of loans it chooses to originate. However, the purchase of $100.3 million in mortgage and consumer loans from Wells Fargo Financial in December 2011 helped the Bank to grow its loan portfolio substantially during that year, and $55.8 million of those loans remained on the Bank\u2019s books at December 31, 2016.\nThe Loan Distribution table that follows sets forth the Bank\u2019s gross loans outstanding, deferred fee income amortized over the life of some loans, the allowance for loan losses and the percentage distribution in each loan category at the dates indicated.\n33\nLoan Portfolio\nDecember 31,\n2016\n2015\nAmount\nPercent\nAmount\nPercent\n(Dollars in thousands)\nCommercial\nCommercial & industrial\n$248,059\n21.1%\n$233,351\n21.8%\nCommercial mortgage\n552,272\n47.0%\n420,049\n39.2%\nCommercial construction\n6,421\n0.5%\n62,415\n5.8%\nCommercial agriculture\n747\n0.1%\n-\n0.0%\nTotal commercial\n807,499\n68.7%\n715,815\n66.9%\nConsumer\nResidential mortgage\n143,951\n12.2%\n144,007\n13.5%\nHome equity\n480\n0.0%\n628\n0.1%\nAutomobile\n30,798\n2.6%\n26,541\n2.5%\nOther consumer loans\n1\n193,279\n16.4%\n183,597\n17.1%\nTotal consumer\n368,508\n31.3%\n354,773\n33.1%\nGross loans\n1,176,007\n100.0%\n1,070,588\n100.0%\nDeferred fee (income) costs, net\n(2,527\n)\n(2,179\n)\nAllowance for loan losses\n(15,435\n)\n(14,159\n)\nLoans, net\n$1,158,045\n$1,054,250\n1\nComprised of other revolving and installment credit and overdrafts.\nThe Bank\u2019s loan portfolio is concentrated in commercial loans (which include loans to governments), primarily in commercial real estate, hotels and gas stations, with the balance in working capital and equipment financing. These are followed by other consumer loans and residential mortgages. The increase in the Bank\u2019s loan portfolio in 2016 was due to customary loan activity throughout our markets, the addition of several significant commercial loans in both the San Francisco and Guam regions, the funding of a commercial agriculture loan, and consumer loan promotions. The Bank\u2019s net loans were concentrated in Guam and San Francisco, at 87.1% of our net loan portfolio as of December 31, 2016, compared to 87.8% as of December 31, 2015. The only industry concentration that was considered significant at December 31, 2016, was within our commercial real estate loan portfolio, which at 47.5% of total gross loans constituted a higher proportion than the 45.1% of total loans at the end of 2015.\nThe Bank\u2019s commercial & industrial loans are made for working capital, financing the purchase of equipment and for other business purposes. Commercial loans include loans with maturities ranging from thirty days to one year and \u201cterm loans\u201d with maturities normally ranging from three to ten years. Short- term business loans are generally intended to finance current transactions and typically provide for periodic principal payments, with interest payable monthly. Term loans normally carry floating interest rates, with monthly payments of both principal and interest, but may be amortized over a longer period than the term of the loan, with a balloon payment at the end of the term.\nThe Bank is an active participant in the Small Business Administration (SBA), State Small Business Credit Initiative (SSBCI), Nor-Cal Financial Development Corp. and U.S. Department of Agriculture guaranteed lending programs, and has been approved by the SBA as a lender under the Preferred and Patriot Express Lender Programs. The Bank regularly makes such guaranteed loans and is frequently recognized as the largest originator of SBA loans in Guam, with an outstanding volume of $6.9 million at December 31, 2016.\nAs of December 31, 2016, commercial and residential real estate loans of $703.1 million consist primarily of adjustable and fixed rate loans secured by deeds of trust or mortgages on commercial and residential property, and comprised 59.8% of the total loan portfolio. The Bank\u2019s commercial mortgages at December 31, 2016, consist of $552.3 million, or 47.0% of gross loans. Commercial construction loans comprise $6.4 million, or 0.5%, of gross loans. Residential mortgages, including home equity loans, were $144.4 million, or 12.3%, of gross loans. Properties securing the commercial and residential real estate loans are located in the Bank\u2019s primary markets, which include the San Francisco Bay area.\nThe Bank\u2019s commercial real estate loans consist primarily of loans based on the borrower\u2019s cash flow and are secured by deeds of trust or mortgages on commercial and residential property to provide a secondary source of repayment. The Bank generally restricts commercial real estate term loans to no more than the lower of 75% of the property\u2019s appraised value or the purchase price of the property during the initial underwriting of the credit, depending on the type of property and its utilization. The Bank offers both fixed\n34\nand floating rate loans. Maturities on commercial real estate loans are generally five years (with amortization up to\ntwenty-five years and a balloon payment due at maturity), and maturities on residential mortgage loans are typically between 15 and 30 years, with many of those loans sold to the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation with the retention of servicing rights\n. SBA and certain other real estate loans that can be sold in the secondary market may be granted for longer maturities.\nThe Bank\u2019s construction loans primarily finance the development and construction of commercial and residential properties. The Bank uses underwriting guidelines to assess the likelihood of repayment from sources such as sale of the property or availability of permanent mortgage financing prior to making the construction loan. Construction loans decreased by $56.0 million to $6.4 million at December 31, 2016, from $62.4 million at December 31, 2015.\nAdditionally, the Bank makes consumer loans for the purpose of financing automobiles, various types of consumer goods, and other personal purposes. Consumer loans generally provide for the monthly payment of principal and interest. Most of the Bank\u2019s consumer loans are either unsecured, secured by the personal property being purchased or, in the instances of home equity loans, real property.\nAt December 31, 2016, total gross loans increased by $105.4 million, or 9.8%, to $1.18 billion from $1.07 billion at December 31, 2015. The increase in loans was largely attributed to a $91.7 million increase in commercial loans to $807.5 million at December 31, 2016, from $715.8 million at December 31, 2015. This was primarily due to several large loans originated in California, Guam and the Marshall Islands. By category, the increase in commercial loans was due to the $132.2 million increase in commercial mortgage loans, a $14.7 million growth in commercial and industrial loans, and the $747 thousand issuance of a commercial agriculture loan, all offset by the decrease of $56.0 million in the commercial construction portfolio as a large construction loan was rolled over into a commercial mortgage. The increase in commercial loans was supplemented by a $13.7 million increase in consumer loans to $368.5 million at December 31, 2016, up from $354.8 million at December 31, 2015. The increase in consumer loans was principally due to growth of $9.7 million in other consumer loans as a result of pre-approved loans and a holiday loan promotion and a $4.3 million increase in automobile loans. The growth of other consumer loans and automobile loans was offset by modest decreases in home equity loans and residential mortgages.\nAt December 31, 2016, loans outstanding were comprised of approximately 67.4% variable rate loans and 32.6% fixed rate loans.\nSince it first opened in 1972, the Bank has expanded its operations and its branch network, first in Guam, then in the other islands of our region and in San Francisco, California. In the interests of enhancing performance and stability through market and industry diversification, the Bank has increased its focus on growth in the San Francisco area in recent years, adding personnel with experience and expertise in the Bay Area. The following table provides figures for net loans in the Bank\u2019s administrative regions, after adjusting for deferred fee income and the allowance for loan losses, for the years ending December 31, 2014, 2015 and 2016.\nAt December 31,\n2014\n2015\n2016\nGuam\n$631,889\n$671,579\n$709,715\nCommonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands\n$66,055\n$71,975\n$74,379\nThe Freely Associated States of Micronesia *\n$47,227\n$56,301\n$75,324\nCalifornia\n$222,222\n$254,395\n$298,627\nTotal\n$967,393\n$1,054,250\n$1,158,045\n*\nThe Freely Associated States are comprised of the Federated States of Micronesia (Chuuk, Kosrae, Pohnpei and Yap), the Republic of Palau and the Republic of the Marshall Islands.\nAs the table indicates, the Bank\u2019s total net loans increased by 9.8% during 2016 and by 9.0% during 2015. Total loans in California increased by $44.2 million, or 17.4%, accounting for 42.6% of total portfolio growth during 2016.  Loan growth in Guam was second, at $38.1 million, or 36.7% of total loan growth, and outstanding loans in the Freely Associated States of Micronesia grew by $19.0 million, or 18.3% of total growth. For the two years ended December 31, 2016, Guam accounted for 40.8% of total loan growth and California contributed 40.1%. Although the economy in the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands is recovering at a more rapid pace, loan growth has not yet caught up.\n35\nLoan Maturities\nThe following table presents the maturity distribution of the Bank\u2019s loans as of December 31, 2016. The table shows the distribution of such loans between those with predetermined (fixed) interest rates and those with variable (floating) interest rates. Floating rates generally fluctuate with changes in the New York prime rate, as reflected in The Wall Street Journal, and the Bank of Guam prime rate.\nAt December 31, 2016\nDue in Less Than 1 Year\nDue in More\nThan 1 Year But Less Than 5 Years\nDue in More Than 5 Years\nNon-Accrual\nTotal\n(Dollars in thousands)\nCommercial loans\n$6,399\n$409,328\n$384,288\n$7,484\n$807,499\nResidential Mortgages\n266\n13,210\n124,567\n6,388\n144,431\nConsumer Loans\n19,560\n194,566\n9,777\n174\n224,077\nTotal\n$26,225\n$617,104\n$518,632\n$14,046\n$1,176,007\nVariable rate loans\n$6,189\n$338,110\n$438,215\n$9,791\n$792,305\nFixed rate loans\n20,036\n278,994\n80,417\n4,255\n383,702\nTotal\n$26,225\n$617,104\n$518,632\n$14,046\n$1,176,007\nLoan Servicing\nAs of December 31, 2016 and 2015, there were $211.0 million and $213.2 million, respectively, in Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation loans that were serviced by the Bank.\nLoan servicing rights are included in Accrued Interest Receivable and Other Assets on the consolidated balance sheets, and are reported at estimated fair value.\nNonperforming Assets\nFinancial institutions generally have a certain level of exposure to credit quality risk, and could potentially receive less than a full return of principal and interest if a debtor becomes unable or unwilling to repay. Since loans are the most significant assets of the Bank and generate the largest portion of its revenues, the Bank\u2019s management of credit risk is focused primarily on loan quality.\nBanks have generally suffered their most severe earnings declines as a result of customers\u2019 inability to generate sufficient cash flow to service their debts, and\/or downturns in national and regional economies and declines in overall asset values, including real estate prices.\nThe Bank\u2019s credit policies identify allowable geographic credit concentrations. In addition, these policies establish the Bank\u2019s underwriting standards and the methods of monitoring credit quality on an ongoing basis. The Bank\u2019s internal credit risk controls are focused on underwriting practices, credit originating procedures, training, risk management techniques, and familiarity with loan customers, as well as the relative diversity and geographic concentration of our loan portfolio.\nThe Bank\u2019s credit risk may also be affected by external factors, such as the level of interest rates, employment, general economic conditions, real estate values, and trends in particular industries or geographic markets. As an independent community bank serving a specific geographic area, the Bank must contend with the unpredictable changes in the general regional market and, particularly, primary local markets. The Bank\u2019s asset quality has been affected in the past by the impact of national and regional recessions, consumer bankruptcies, and depressed real estate values.\nNonperforming assets are comprised of the following: loans for which the Bank is no longer accruing interest; restructured loans that are more than 90 days past due; loans 90 days or more past due and still accruing interest (although they are generally placed on non-accrual when they become 90 days past due, unless they are both well-secured and in the process of revision or collection); and other real estate owned (\u201cOREO\u201d) that is acquired through foreclosures. Management\u2019s classification of a loan as \u201cnon-accrual\u201d is an indication that there is reasonable doubt as to the full recovery of principal or interest on the loan. At that point, the Bank stops accruing interest income, and reverses any uncollected interest that had previously been accrued. These loans may or may not be collateralized, and collection efforts are pursued. The Bank begins recognizing interest income again only as cash interest payments are received and it has been determined that the collection of all outstanding principal is no longer in doubt. Loans may be restructured by management when a borrower has experienced some change in financial status causing an inability to meet the original repayment\n36\nterms and where the Bank believes the borrower will e\nventually overcome those circumstances and make full repayment. OREO consists of properties acquired by foreclosure or similar means that management is offering or will offer for sale. Total OREO, net of OREO reserves, was $2.7 million at December 31, 2016\n, compared to $3.3 million at December 31, 2015.\nNonperforming Assets\nThe following table provides information about nonperforming assets by asset type as of December 31, 2016 and 2015.\nDecember 31,\n2016\n2015\n(Dollars in Thousands)\nNonperforming Assets.\nNon-accrual Loans past due 30 days or more\n$4,927\n$9,195\nLoans past due 90 days or more still accruing\n1,882\n1,631\nRestructured Loans past due 30 days \u2013 not included above\n-\n-\nOther Real Estate Owned, gross\n2,746\n3,460\nTotal Nonperforming Assets\n$9,555\n$14,286\nThe following table provides information about nonperforming loans by loan type.\nDecember 31,\n2016\n2015\n(Dollars in Thousands)\nNonperforming Loans.\nCommercial.\nCommercial & Industrial\n$119\n$206\nCommercial Mortgage\n691\n4,105\nCommercial Construction\n-\n-\nCommercial Agriculture\n-\n-\nTotal Commercial\n810\n4,311\nConsumer.\nResidential Mortgage\n4,088\n4,956\nHome Equity\n-\n-\nAutomobile\n104\n59\nOther Consumer\n1,807\n1,500\nTotal Consumer\n5,999\n6,515\nTotal Nonperforming Loans\n$6,809\n$10,826\nAllowance for Loan Losses\nThe Bank maintains its allowance for loan losses at a level which, in management\u2019s judgment, is adequate to absorb prospective credit losses inherent in the loan portfolio as of the balance sheet date. The amount of the allowance is based on management\u2019s evaluation of the collectability of the loan portfolio, including the nature and volume of the portfolio, credit concentrations, trends in historical loss experience, the level of certain classified and impaired loans, and economic conditions, along with their related impacts on specific borrowers and industry groups. The allowance is increased by provisions for loan losses, which are charged against earnings, and reduced by charge-offs, net of recoveries. Because of uncertainties inherent in the estimation process, management\u2019s estimate of potential credit losses in the loan portfolio and the related allowance may change from time to time.\nThe Bank\u2019s allowance for loan losses increased by $1.3 million to $15.4 million during 2016 from $14.2 million at the end of 2015. The increase in the allowance for loan losses in 2016 was based primarily on growth in our loan portfolio and management\u2019s periodic reevaluation of its inherent risk. The Bank had $5.6 million in charge-offs in 2016, which were partially offset by loan recoveries of $3.0 million.\nNet loans charged-off includes the realization of losses in the portfolio that were partially recognized previously through provisions for loan losses and write-downs of loan principal valuations. Net charge-offs were $2.6 million in 2016, 8.3% lower than the net charge-offs of $2.9 million in 2015. The 2016 net charge-offs were lower primarily due to a principal recovery received from the payoff of one classified commercial loan, including a portion of the loan that had previously been written down. Historical net loan charge-offs are not necessarily indicative of the amount of net charge-offs that the Bank will realize in the future.\n37\nThe table in Note 6 \u2013 Loans, under\nCredit Quality Indicators\n, provides a summary of t\nhe allocation of the allowance for loan losses for specific categories at the dates indicated. The allocation presented should not be interpreted as an indication that charges to the allowance for loan losses will be incurred in these amounts or proportion\ns, or that the portion of the allowance allocated to each category represents the total amount available for charge-offs that may occur within these categories.\nAllocation of Loan Loss Allowance\nThe material set forth in Note 6 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 15 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K is incorporated by reference.\nDeposits\nThe composition and cost of the Bank\u2019s deposit base are important components in analyzing the Bank\u2019s net interest margin and balance sheet liquidity characteristics, both of which are discussed in greater detail in other sections in this report. The Bank\u2019s liquidity is impacted by the volatility of deposits or other funding instruments or, in other words, by the propensity of that money to leave the institution for interest rate-related or other reasons. Deposits can be adversely affected if economic conditions in the Bank\u2019s market area weaken. Potentially, the most volatile deposits in a financial institution are jumbo certificates of deposit, meaning time deposits with balances that equal or exceed $100,000, as customers with balances of that magnitude are typically more rate-sensitive than customers with smaller balances.\nThe following table summarizes the distribution of deposits for the periods indicated.\nDecember 31,\n2016\n2015\n(Dollars in Thousands)\nNon-interest bearing deposits\n$469,451\n$413,662\nInterest bearing deposits.\nDemand deposits\n346,922\n167,227\nRegular savings\n669,957\n610,324\nTime deposits.\n$100,000 or more\n43,757\n37,012\nLess than $100,000\n14,325\n14,073\nOther interest bearing deposits\n234,258\n180,373\nTotal interest bearing deposits\n1,309,219\n1,009,009\nTotal Deposits\n$1,778,670\n$1,422,671\nThe Bank gathers deposits from among the communities it serves. The Bank\u2019s business is not generally seasonal in nature, and the Bank is not primarily dependent upon funds from sources outside the United States of America, but approximately 24.3% of its deposit base at December 31, 2016, is acquired in the Micronesian islands that are politically organized in free association with the United States and use the U.S. dollar as their currency. At December 31, 2016 and 2015, 34.1% and 30.4% of deposits were from domestic and foreign government sources.\nNon-interest and low interest-bearing demand deposits increased by $235.5 million, or 40.5%, to $816.4 million at December 31, 2016, compared to $580.9 million at December 31, 2015.\nAs mentioned earlier, the Bank has expanded its operations and its branch network since it first opened in 1972, first in Guam, then in the other islands of our region and in San Francisco, California. As time has passed, the Bank has gathered market share in each of the islands. In recent years, in order to diversify its geographic market, the Bank has increased its focus on growth in the San Francisco area. The following table provides figures for deposits in the Bank\u2019s administrative regions for the years ending December 31, 2014, 2015 and 2016.\nAt December 31,\n2014\n2015\n2016\nGuam\n$792,378\n$824,661\n$975,526\nCommonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands\n$230,654\n$234,336\n$319,895\nThe Freely Associated States of Micronesia *\n$285,509\n$314,603\n$431,865\nCalifornia\n$46,973\n$49,071\n$51,384\nTotal\n$1,355,514\n$1,422,671\n$1,778,670\n38\n*\nThe Freely Associated States are comprised of the Federated States of Micronesia (Chuuk, Kosrae, Pohnpei and Yap), the Republic of Palau and the Republic of the Marshall Islands.\nDuring 2016, deposits increased by a total of $356.0 million, of which $150.9 million, or 42.4%, was in the Bank\u2019s Guam branches and $117.3 million, or 32.9%, was in our Freely Associated States branches. Deposits increased in our CNMI branches by $85.6 million. Overall, the Bank\u2019s deposit base increased by 25.0% during 2016, after rising by 5.0% during 2015.  Deposits increased in the California region by 4.7% in the year ended December 31, 2016, after increasing by 4.5% the previous year as a continuation of gradual, moderate growth in that market. The California region contributed 0.6% of total Bank deposit growth during 2016, after having contributed 3.1% of total Bank deposit growth during 2015.\nDeposit Maturity Distribution\nAt December 31, 2016, the scheduled maturities of time deposits were as follows.\nYears ending December 31,\n2017\n$53,673\n2018\n1,208\n2019\n866\n2020\n1,279\n2021 and thereafter\n1,056\nTotal\n$58,082\nThe Bank provides and services government and business deposit accounts that are frequently more than $100,000 in average balance per account. The account activity for some account types and client types necessitates appropriate liquidity management practices by the Bank to ensure its ability to fund withdrawals.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nIn the normal course of business, the Bank makes commitments to extend credit to its customers as long as there are no violations of any conditions established in the associated contractual arrangements. These commitments are obligations that represent a potential credit risk to the Bank, yet are not reflected in any form within the Company\u2019s consolidated balance sheets other than in a modest contingency reserve against those commitments. Total unused commitments to extend credit were $152.6 million at December 31, 2016, as compared to $153.4 million at December 31, 2015. Unused commitments represented 13.0% and 14.3% of outstanding gross loans at December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively.\nThe effect on the Bank\u2019s revenues, expenses, cash flows and liquidity from the unused portion of the commitments to provide credit cannot be reasonably predicted, because there is no certainty that these lines of credit will ever be fully utilized, if at all. For more information regarding the Company\u2019s off-balance sheet arrangements, see Note 16 to the financial statements located elsewhere herein.\nThe following table presents the Bank\u2019s commitments to extend credit for the periods indicated.\nDecember 31,\n2016\n2015\nCommitments to extend credit\n$152,585\n$153,412\nLetters of credit.\nStandby letters of credit\n$52,396\n$49,256\nCommercial letters of credit\n3,045\n6,546\nTotal\n$55,441\n$55,802\nContractual Obligations\nThe Bank utilizes facilities, equipment and land under various operating leases with original terms ranging from 1 to 99 years. Some of these leases include scheduled rent increases. The total amount of the rent is being expensed on the straight-line method over the lease terms. The Bank has recorded a deferred obligation of $926 thousand and $874 thousand as of December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively, which has been included within other liabilities, to reflect the excess of rent expense over cash paid on the leases.\n39\nAt December 31, 2016, annual lease commitments under the above noncancelable operating leases were as follows.\nYears ending December 31,\n2017\n$1,889\n2018\n1,528\n2019\n1,337\n2020\n1,190\n2021 and Thereafter\n21,385\nTotal\n$27,329\nThe Bank leases certain facilities from two separate entities in which two of its directors have separate ownership interests. Lease payments made to these entities during the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014 approximated $379 thousand, $370 thousand and $370 thousand, respectively.\nAdditionally, the Bank leases office space to third parties, with original lease terms ranging from 3 to 5 years and option periods ranging up to 15 years. At December 31, 2016, minimum future rents to be received under non-cancelable operating sublease agreements were $44 thousand, $29 thousand, $20 and $13 for the years ending December 31, 2017, 2018, 2019 and 2020, respectively. Although it is possible that one or more of these leases will be renewed, there is no certainty upon which to base an estimate.\nA summary of rental activities for years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, is as follows.\nFor the Years Ended December 31,\n2016\n2015\n2014\nRent expense\n$2,673\n$2,480\n$2,472\nLess: sublease rentals\n291\n274\n273\nNet rent expense\n$2,382\n$2,206\n$2,199\nLiquidity and Asset\/Liability Management\nLiquidity refers to the Bank\u2019s ability to maintain cash flows sufficient to fund operations and to meet obligations and other commitments in a timely and cost-effective fashion. At various times the Bank requires funds to meet short-term cash requirements brought about by loan growth or deposit outflows, the purchase of assets, or liability repayments. The Bank\u2019s large base of core deposits is an integral part of its ability to manage its liquidity position appropriately. These core deposits are generated by offering traditional banking services in its service areas and have, historically, been a stable source of funds. To manage liquidity needs properly, cash inflows must be timed to coincide with anticipated outflows, or other sufficient liquid resources must be available to meet varying demands. The Bank manages cash and investment securities in order to be able to meet unexpected, sudden changes in levels of its assets or deposit liabilities without maintaining excessive amounts of balance sheet liquidity. Excess balance sheet liquidity can negatively impact the Bank\u2019s interest margin. In order to meet short-term liquidity needs, the Bank may utilize overnight Federal Funds purchases and other borrowing arrangements with correspondent banks, and use interest rate pricing to attract new deposits from local sources; it also maintains collateralized lines of credit with the FHLB and the FRB. In addition, the Bank can obtain cash for temporary needs by selling securities that it classifies as Available-for-Sale.\nAt December 31, 2016, the Bank had an increase in gross loans of $105.4 million from December 31, 2015, funded by the $356.0 million increase in its deposit base. One of the measures of liquidity is our loan-to-deposit ratio, based upon gross loans, which decreased to 66.1% at December 31, 2016, compared to 75.3% at December 31, 2015. Each calendar quarter, the Bank performs a six-month cash flow analysis to ensure that it will have sufficient liquidity to meet all of its potential cash obligations under a worst-case scenario, and maintains excess liquidity under those hypothetical conditions.\nFHLB, FRB and Other Borrowings and Available Lines of Credit\nThe Bank has off-balance sheet liquidity in the form of Federal Funds purchase arrangements with correspondent banks, as well as collateralized borrowing arrangements with the FHLB and the FRB. The Bank can borrow from the FHLB on a short-term (typically overnight) or long-term (more than one year) basis. At December 31, 2016, the Bank had no long-term borrowings. The Bank had an available line of credit of $116.6 million with the FHLB of Des Moines at December 31, 2016.\nThe Bank can also borrow from the FRB\u2019s discount window. It had $27.0 million of investment securities pledged to the FRB San Francisco as collateral on an available line of credit of $25.6 million at December 31, 2016, none of which credit was outstanding.\n40\nAt December 31, 2016, the Bank had arrangements for F\nederal Funds purchases of up to $17.0 million from three of its U.S. correspondent financial institutions. The Bank had no Federal Funds purchases outstanding at December 31, 2016 and 2015.\nAt December 31, 2016, the Company had no other borrowed funds.\nCapital Resources\nThe Bank is subject to various regulatory capital requirements administered by the United States federal banking agencies. Failure to meet minimum capital requirements can initiate certain mandatory and possibly additional discretionary actions by regulators that, if undertaken, could have a direct material effect on the Bank\u2019s consolidated financial statements. Under capital adequacy guidelines and the regulatory framework for prompt corrective action, the Bank must meet specific capital guidelines that involve quantitative measures of their assets, liabilities and certain off-balance-sheet items, as calculated under regulatory accounting practices.\nQuantitative measures established by regulation to ensure capital adequacy require the Bank to maintain minimum amounts and ratios (set forth in the following table) of total, Tier 1 and common equity Tier 1 capital (as defined in the regulations) to risk-weighted assets (as defined) and of Tier 1 capital (as defined) to average assets (as defined). The common equity Tier 1 capital to risk-weighted assets ratio was newly required effective January 1, 2015. Management believes, as of December 31, 2016 and 2015, that the Bank met all capital adequacy requirements to which it is subject.\nAs of December 31, 2016, the most recent notification from the FDIC categorized the Bank as well capitalized under the regulatory framework for prompt corrective action. To be categorized as well capitalized, an institution must maintain minimum total risk-based, Tier 1 risk-based and Tier 1 leverage ratios as set forth in the following table. There are no conditions or events since the notification that management believes have changed the Bank\u2019s category. The Bank\u2019s actual capital amounts and ratios as of December 31, 2016 and 2015, are also presented in the table.\nActual\nFor Capital Adequacy\nPurposes\nTo Be Well Capitalized\nUnder Prompt Corrective\nAction Provisions\nAmount\nRatio\nAmount\nRatio\nAmount\nRatio\nAt December 31, 2016.\nTotal capital (to Risk\nWeighted Assets)\n$144,827\n12.610%\n$99,023\n8.625%\n$114,809\n10.000%\nTier 1 capital (to Risk\nWeighted Assets)\n$130,463\n11.360%\n$76,061\n6.625%\n$91,847\n8.000%\nTier 1 capital (to Average\nAssets)\n$130,463\n7.060%\n$73,937\n4.000%\n$92,421\n5.000%\nCommon Equity Tier 1\nCapital (to Risk Weighted\nAssets)\n$125,463\n10.930%\n$58,839\n5.125%\n$74,626\n6.500%\nAt December 31, 2015.\nTotal capital (to Risk\nWeighted Assets)\n$128,119\n12.452%\n$82,315\n8.000%\n$102,893\n10.000%\nTier 1 capital (to Risk\nWeighted Assets)\n$115,242\n11.200%\n$61,736\n6.000%\n$82,315\n8.000%\nTier 1 capital (to Average\nAssets)\n$115,242\n7.404%\n$62,256\n4.000%\n$77,820\n5.000%\nCommon Equity Tier 1\nCapital (to Risk Weighted\nAssets)\n$115,242\n11.200%\n$46,302\n4.500%\n$66,881\n6.500%\nMarket Risk\nMarket risk is the risk of loss of future earnings, fair values or cash flows that may result from changes in the price of a financial instrument. The value of a financial instrument may change as a result of changes in interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates, commodity prices, equity prices and other market changes that affect market risk sensitive instruments. Market risk is an attribute of all market risk sensitive financial instruments, including securities, loans, deposits and borrowings, as well as a company\u2019s role as a financial intermediary in customer-related transactions. The objective of market risk management is to avoid excessive exposure of the company\u2019s earnings and equity to loss, and to reduce the volatility inherent in certain types of financial instruments.\n41\nInterest Rate Risk Management\nMarket risk arises from changes in interest rates, exchange rates, commodity prices and equity prices. The Bank\u2019s market risk exposure is primarily that of interest rate risk, and it has established policies and procedures to monitor and limit earnings and balance sheet exposure to changes in interest rates. The Bank does not engage in the trading of financial instruments, and has only nominal direct exposure to currency exchange rate risk, but has indirect exposure to exchange rate risk because of the dominant position of foreign tourism in its primary markets.\nThe principal objective of interest rate risk management (often referred to as \u201casset\/liability management\u201d) is to manage the financial components of the Bank\u2019s balance sheet, as well as their characteristics, in a manner that will optimize the risk\/reward equation for earnings and capital in relation to changing interest rates. The Bank\u2019s exposure to market risk is reviewed on a monthly basis by its Asset and Liability Committee. Interest rate risk is the potential for economic losses due to future interest rate changes. These economic losses can be reflected as a loss of future net interest income and\/or a loss of current fair market values. The objective is to measure the effect on net interest income and to adjust the balance sheet to minimize the inherent risk while simultaneously maximizing income. Management realizes certain risks are inherent, and that the goal is to identify and manage those risks. Management uses two methodologies to manage interest rate risk: (i) a standard GAP analysis; and (ii) an interest rate shock simulation model.\nThe planning of asset and liability maturities is an integral part of the management of an institution\u2019s net interest margin. To the extent that the maturities of assets and liabilities do not match in a changing interest rate environment, the net interest margin may change over time. Even with perfectly matched re-pricing of assets and liabilities, risks remain in the form of prepayment risk for some loans and securities, or in the form of risks of delays in the adjustment of interest rates applying to either earning assets with floating rates or to interest bearing liabilities. The Bank has generally been able to control its exposure to changing interest rates by maintaining a substantial proportion of its portfolio in floating interest rate loans and a majority of its time deposits with relatively short maturities.\nInterest rate changes do not affect all categories of assets and liabilities equally or at the same time. Varying interest rate environments can create unexpected changes in prepayment levels of assets and liabilities, which may have a significant effect on the net interest margin and are not reflected in the interest sensitivity analysis table. Because of these factors, an interest sensitivity gap report may not provide a complete assessment of the exposure to changes in interest rates.\nThe Bank uses modeling software for asset\/liability management in order to simulate the effects of potential interest rate changes on its net interest margin, and to calculate the estimated fair values of the Bank\u2019s financial instruments under different interest rate scenarios. The program utilizes current balances, interest rates, maturity dates and re-pricing information for individual financial instruments, and incorporates assumptions on the characteristics of embedded options along with pricing and duration for those instruments to project the effects of a given interest rate change on the Bank\u2019s interest income and interest expense. Rate scenarios consisting of key rate and yield curve projections are run against the Bank\u2019s investment, loan, deposit and borrowed funds portfolios. These rate projections can be shocked (an immediate and parallel change in all base rates, up or down) and ramped (with incremental increases or decreases in rates over a specified time period), based on current trends and forecasts, including stable economic conditions.\n42\nThe following table sets forth the estimated changes in the Bank\u2019s\nnet interest income that would result from the designated instantaneous parallel shifts in interest rates noted, as of December 31, 2016. Computations of prospective effects of hypothetical interest rate changes are based on numerous assumptions, includin\ng relative levels of market interest rates, loan prepayments and deposit decay, and should not be relied upon as indicative of actual results. (Please note that, in the current interest rate environment, the reductions in rates presented in the analysis ar\ne unlikely to occur.)\nIncrease\/(Decrease) in Estimated Net Interest\nIncome\nAmount\nPercent\n(Dollars in thousands)\nChange in Interest Rates (basis points)\n+400\n$27,121\n35.85%\n+300\n$20,317\n26.86%\n+200\n$13,386\n17.69%\n+100\n$6,241\n8.25%\n\u00b1   0\n$-\n0.00%\n-100\n$(2,488\n)\n-3.29%\n-200\n$(3,858\n)\n-5.10%\n-300\n$(4,329\n)\n-5.72%\n-400\n$(4,528\n)\n-5.98%\nThese data do not reflect any actions that we may undertake in response to changes in interest rates, such as changes in rates paid on certain deposit accounts based on local competitive factors, which could improve or attenuate the actual impact on net interest income.\nAs with any method of gauging interest rate risk, there are certain shortcomings inherent to the methodology noted above. The model assumes interest rate changes are instantaneous, and result in parallel shifts in the yield curve. In reality, rate changes are rarely instantaneous. The use of the simplifying assumption that short-term and long-term rates change by the same degree also disregards historic rate change patterns, which rarely show parallel yield curve shifts. Further, the model assumes that certain assets and liabilities of similar maturity or period to re-pricing will react in the same way to changes in rates. In reality, certain types of financial instruments may react in advance of changes in market rates, while the reaction of other types of financial instruments may lag significantly behind the change in general market rates. Additionally, the methodology noted above does not reflect the full impact of annual and lifetime restrictions on changes in rates for certain assets, such as adjustable rate loans. When interest rates change, actual loan prepayments and actual early withdrawals from time certificates may deviate significantly from the assumptions used in the model. Finally, this methodology does not measure or reflect the impact that higher rates may have on adjustable-rate loan clients\u2019 ability to service their debt. All of these factors are considered in less formulaic ways in monitoring the Bank\u2019s exposure to interest rate risk.\nCritical Accounting Policies\nGeneral\nThe Company\u2019s consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (generally accepted accounting principles, or \u201cGAAP\u201d). The financial information contained within our consolidated financial statements is, to a significant extent, based on approximate measures of the financial effects of transactions and events that have already occurred. A variety of factors could affect the ultimate value that is obtained, either when earning income, recognizing an expense, recovering an asset or relieving a liability. In certain instances, we use a discount factor and prepayment assumptions to determine the present value of assets and liabilities. A change in the discount factor or prepayment speeds could increase or decrease the values of those assets and liabilities, which would result in either a beneficial or adverse impact to our financial results. We use historical loss factors as one factor in determining the inherent loss that may be present in our loan portfolio. Actual losses could differ significantly from the historical factors that we use. Other estimates that we use are related to the realization of our deferred tax assets and the expected useful lives of our depreciable assets. In addition, GAAP itself may change from one previously acceptable method to another, although the economics of our transactions would remain the same.\nFair Value of Securities\nIn accordance with GAAP, the Bank revalues the Available-for-Sale component of its investment portfolio on a quarterly basis, and records any unrealized gain or loss as an adjustment to other comprehensive income in its equity accounts. Held-to-Maturity securities are recorded at their amortized book value. The Bank also evaluates whether any of its security holdings are Other Than Temporarily Impaired (\u201cOTTI\u201d), but has determined that, as of December 31, 2016, none of its securities are deemed to be OTTI.\n43\nAllowance for Loan Losses\nThe allowance for loan losses is an estimate of the potential losses in our loan portfolio. Our accounting for estimated loan losses was previously discussed in this Item 7 under the heading,\n\u201cAllowance for Loan Losses.\u201d\nDeferred Tax Assets\nOur net deferred income tax asset arises from temporary differences between the carrying amount of assets and liabilities reported in the financial statements and the amounts used for income tax return purposes. Our accounting for Deferred Tax Assets was previously discussed under the heading \u201c\nIncome Tax Expense\n\u201d.","75":"","76":"","77":"","78":"ITEM 7.\nMANAGEMENT\u2019S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITIO\nN AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nYou should read the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations together with our historical consolidated financial statements and the related notes thereto appearing in this Annual Report. In addition to historical information, some of the information contained in this discussion and analysis or set forth elsewhere in this Annual Report, including information with respect to our plans and strategy for our business and related financing, includes forward\u2010looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. As a result of many factors, including those factors set forth in the \u201cRisk Factors\u201d section of this Annual Report, our actual results could differ materially from the results described in or implied by the forward\u2010looking statements contained in the following discussion and analysis.\nOverview\nWe are a fully integrated specialty pharmaceutical company developing, manufacturing and commercializing innovative treatments for pain and other conditions. Given the need for acute and chronic pain products and the issue of prescription abuse, we are focused on bringing non-narcotic and abuse-deterrent opioid formulations to patients and physicians. We are currently marketing SPRIX\n\u00ae\n(ketorolac tromethamine) Nasal Spray (\u201cSPRIX Nasal Spray\u201d) and OXAYDO\n\u00ae\n(oxycodone HCI, USP) tablets for oral use only\u2014 CII (\u201cOXAYDO\u201d). On January 9, 2017, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (\u201cFDA\u201d) approved Egalet\u2019s first product developed using our proprietary GuardianTM Technology, ARYMO ERTM (morphine sulfate) extended-release (\u201cER\u201d) tablets (\u201cARYMO ER\u201d), an ER morphine product formulated with abuse-deterrent (\u201cAD\u201d) properties. We plan to make ARYMO ER, which is approved for the management of pain severe enough to require daily, around-the-clock, long-term opioid treatment and for which alternative treatment options are inadequate, commercially available at the end of the first quarter 2017. We also are developing Egalet-002, a Guardian Technology AD, ER, oral oxycodone formulation currently in Phase 3 studies, for the same indication as ARYMO ER. We plan to continue to grow through the revenues of our three approved products, business development and leveraging our proprietary Guardian Technology.\nWith approximately 100 million Americans suffering from chronic pain according to the Institute of Medicine and an estimated 29.0 million people suffering from drug use disorders worldwide according to the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime. World Drug Report 2016, there is a need for pain treatments and the need to decrease the abuse of pain medications. In reaction to this widespread prescription opioid misuse and abuse, the U.S. government and the FDA have established this issue as a high priority. In February 2016, the FDA announced an action plan to combat the growing problem of prescription abuse, importantly highlighting the development of AD formulations as a part of the solution. In addition, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (\u201cCDC\u201d) has stated that the first line of therapy should be non-opioid treatments, such as non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (\u201cNSAIDs\u201d). We are committed to developing, manufacturing and marketing non-narcotic treatment options such as NSAIDs and abuse-deterrent formulation opioids to provide treatment options that are less likely to be abused or deter abuse.\nOur goal is to be a leading specialty pharmaceutical company focused on developing and commercializing innovative treatments for pain and other conditions. In 2016, we had a 71-person specialty sales force targeting the approximately 11,500 physicians in the high\u2010decile of pain medicine prescribers in the United States to build awareness and increase adoption of both SPRIX Nasal Spray and OXAYDO. With the pending launch of ARYMO ER, we are transitioning the salesforce into two separate teams. 50 territory managers will promote OXAYDO and ARYMO ER to approximately 6,000 healthcare providers. Another 32 territory managers will focus on educating approximately 4,500\n75\nTable of Contents\nhealthcare providers about SPRIX Nasal spray. In addition, we have an account management team calling on commercial and government payers and a trade team focused on channel partners.\nIn December 2016, we filed a supplemental new drug application (\u201csNDA\u201d) for OXAYDO to the FDA to support an abuse-deterrent label claim for the intravenous route of abuse. The application was based on data that was presented at the PAINWeek conference in September 2016. In addition, we have submitted a prior approval supplement to the FDA for a 10 mg and 15 mg dose of OXAYDO to potentially provide patients and physicians additional dosage options beyond the currently marketed 5 mg and 7.5 mg doses.\nWe are developing our product candidate, Egalet\u2010002 as an AD, ER oxycodone product for the management of pain severe enough to require daily, around-the-clock, long-term opioid treatment and for which alternative treatment options are inadequate. We have a pivotal Phase 3 clinical development program for Egalet-002 ongoing. We have conducted Phase 1 pharmacokinetic (\u201cPK\u201d) trials of Egalet\u2010002, a battery of Category 1 AD studies compared to OxyContin, a Category 3 intranasal human abuse potential (\u201cHAP\u201d) study and a pilot Category 3 oral HAP study. We anticipate completing the Phase 3 program in the fourth quarter of 2017. The FDA has granted us Fast Track status with respect to Egalet\u2010002. Based on this and the expected timing of our clinical trials, we anticipate submitting an New Drug Application for Egalet\u2010002 in 2019.\nIn addition to growing through product sales, we plan to conduct business development to build on our product portfolio and leverage Guardian Technology to fuel pipeline growth. Our business development activities will be concentrated in three areas: 1) augment our product portfolio through potential in-licenses and product acquisitions; 2) enhance the opportunity for our existing products through partnerships that access physicians and patients outside our commercial focus in the United States or markets outside the United States; and 3) develop partnerships to leverage our Guardian Technology by collaborating around our current product candidates or exploring new product opportunities.\nFinancial Operations\nOur net losses were $43.2 million, $57.9 million and $90.6 million for the years ended December 31, 2014, 2015 and 2016, respectively. We recognized related party revenues of $1.9 million in the year ended December 31, 2014, related party revenues and net product sales of $18.6 million and $4.2 million, respectively, for the year ended December 31, 2015 and collaboration revenues and net product sales of $100,000 and $16.9 million, respectively, for the year ended December 31, 2016.  As of December 31, 2016, we had an accumulated deficit of $225.2 million. We expect to incur significant expenses and operating losses for the foreseeable future as we incur significant commercialization expenses as we continue to grow our sales, marketing and distribution infrastructure to sell our commercial products in the U.S.  Additionally, we expect to continue the development and clinical trials of, and seek regulatory approval for, our product candidates, as well as scale-up manufacturing capabilities, protect and expand our intellectual property portfolio and hire additional personnel.\nUntil we become profitable, if ever, we will seek to fund our operations primarily through public or private equity or debt financings or other sources. Other additional financing may not be available to us on acceptable terms, or at all. Our failure to raise capital as and when needed could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and our ability to pursue our business strategy. If we are unable to raise capital when needed or on attractive terms, we could be forced to delay, reduce or eliminate our research and development programs or any future commercialization efforts.\nFinancial Operations Overview\nRevenue\nTo date, we have generated no revenues from ARYMO ER, our recently approved product, and Egalet\u2010002, our clinical stage product candidate.  We have generated $21.0 million in net product revenue from our other approved products, SPRIX Nasal Spray and OXAYDO, and have generated $22.6 million in total revenue since our inception from feasibility and collaboration agreements. Our ability to generate additional revenue and become profitable depends upon our ability to expand the marketing of our approved products and commercialize our product candidates, or other product candidates that we may in-license or acquire in the future.\n76\nTable of Contents\nCost of Sales (excluding amortization of product rights)\nCost of sales includes the cost of inventory sold or reserved; manufacturing, supply chain costs, product shipping and handling costs, and product royalties.  The cost of sales associated with the deferred product revenues is recorded as deferred costs, which are included in inventory, until such time the deferred revenue is recognized.\nAmortization of Product Rights\nAmortization of product rights consists of the amortization expense associated with the intangible product rights related to the SPRIX Nasal Spray acquisition and OXAYDO license.  These expenses are recognized on a straight line basis over the useful life of the related intangible asset.\nGeneral & Administrative Expenses\nGeneral and administrative expenses consist primarily of salaries and related costs for personnel in our executive, finance and other administrative areas. Other general and administrative expenses include facility costs and professional fees for legal, patent, regulatory fees, consulting and accounting services.  We anticipate that our general and administrative expenses will increase in the future due to the growth of our commercialization efforts for our approved products and, if approved, our product candidates and to fund ongoing public company costs. These increases will likely include increased costs for insurance, costs related to the hiring of additional personnel and payments to outside consultants, regulatory fees, and legal and accounting fees, among other expenses.\nSales & Marketing Expenses\nSales and marketing expenses consist primarily of salaries and related costs for personnel in our sales and marketing departments, along with our third party contracted sales force.  Other sales and marketing costs include professional fees for consulting and promotional materials. We anticipate that our sales and marketing expenses will continue to increase as we grow our commercial operations for our approved products and, if approved, our product candidates. These increases will likely include increased costs for hiring of additional personnel, outside consultants and marketing programs, among other expenses.\nResearch and Development Expenses\nResearch and development expenses consist primarily of costs associated with the development and clinical testing of Egalet\u2010002 and life cycle management opportunities for our approved products. Our research and development expenses consist of.\n\u00b7\nemployee\u2010related expenses, including salaries, benefits, and travel expense;\n\u00b7\nexpenses incurred under agreements with Clinical Research Organizations (\u201cCROs\u201d) and investigative sites that conduct our clinical trials;\n\u00b7\nthe cost of acquiring, developing and manufacturing clinical trial materials;\n\u00b7\nfacilities and other expenses, which include direct and allocated expenses for rent and maintenance of facilities, other supplies; and\n\u00b7\ncosts associated with preclinical activities\nWe expense research and development costs to operations as incurred. We account for non\u2010refundable advance payments for goods and services that will be used in future research and development activities as expenses when the service has been performed or when the goods have been received, rather than when the payment is made.\n77\nTable of Contents\nResearch and development activities are part of our business model. Product candidates in later stages of clinical development generally have higher development costs than those in earlier stages of clinical development, primarily due to the increased size and duration of later\u2010stage clinical trials. We expect to have significant research and development expenses for the foreseeable future.\nWe do not currently utilize a formal time allocation system to capture personnel related expenses on a project\u2010by\u2010project basis because we record expenses by functional department.  However, we do allocate third party research and development expenses to our product and product candidates, as shown in the table below.\nThe following table summarizes our research and development expenses for the years ended December 31, 2014, 2015 and 2016.\n(in thousands)\nYear Ended\nYear Ended\nYear Ended\nDecember 31,\nDecember 31,\nDecember 31,\n2014\n2015\n2016\nARYMO ER\n$10,547\n\t\t\t\t\n$7,777\n\t\t\t\t\n$5,252\n\t\t\t\t\nEgalet\u2010002\n3,397\n\t\t\t\t\n11,613\n\t\t\t\t\n17,883\n\t\t\t\t\nOXAYDO\n\u2014\n\u2014\n4,091\n\t\t\t\t\nOther clinical and preclinical development\n2,634\n\t\t\t\t\n3,853\n\t\t\t\t\n2,054\n\t\t\t\t\nPersonnel related\n5,817\n\t\t\t\t\n3,811\n\t\t\t\t\n4,479\n\t\t\t\t\n$22,395\n\t\t\t\t\n$27,054\n\t\t\t\t\n$33,759\n\t\t\t\t\nWe incurred research and development expenses of $22.4 million, $27.1 million and $33.8 million during the years ended December 31, 2014, 2015 and 2016, respectively. We anticipate that a portion of our operating expenses will continue to be related to research and development as we continue to advance our preclinical programs and our clinical\u2010 stage product candidates.\nIt is difficult to determine with certainty the duration and completion costs of our current or future preclinical programs and clinical trials of our product candidates, or if, when or to what extent we will generate revenues from the commercialization and sale of any of our product candidates that obtain regulatory approval. We may never succeed in achieving regulatory approval for any of our product candidates. The duration, costs and timing of clinical trials and development of our product candidates will depend on a variety of factors, including the uncertainties of future clinical and preclinical studies, uncertainties in clinical trial enrollment rate and significant and changing government regulation. In addition, the probability of success for each product candidate will depend on numerous factors, including competition, manufacturing capability and commercial viability. A change in the outcome of any of these variables with respect to the development of Egalet\u2010002, or any other product candidate could mean a significant change in the costs and timing associated with the development of that product candidate. For example, if regulatory authorities were to require us to conduct clinical trials beyond those which we currently anticipate will be required for the completion of our clinical pipeline or if we experience significant delays in enrollment in any clinical trials, we could be required to expend significant additional financial resources and time on the completion of the clinical development.\nThe successful development of our product candidates is highly uncertain due to the numerous risks and uncertainties associated with developing drugs, including the uncertainty of.\n\u00b7\nthe scope, rate of progress and expense of our research and development activities;\n\u00b7\nclinical trial results;\n\u00b7\nthe terms and timing of regulatory approvals; and\n\u00b7\nthe expense of filing, prosecuting, defending and enforcing patent claims and other intellectual property rights.\n78\nTable of Contents\nAs a result of these uncertainties, we are unable to determine with certainty the duration and completion costs of our development projects or when and to what extent we will receive revenue from the commercialization and sale of our product candidates.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Significant Judgments and Estimates\nOur management\u2019s discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based on our financial statements, which we have prepared in accordance with U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (\u201cGAAP\u201d). The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities and expenses and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities in our financial statements. On an ongoing basis, we evaluate our estimates and judgments, including those related to revenue recognition, debt, stock based compensation, income taxes and accrued research and development expenses, as described in greater detail below. We base our estimates on our limited historical experience, known trends and events and various other factors that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions.\nOur significant accounting policies are described in more detail in the notes to our financial statements appearing at the end of this filing. However, we believe that the following accounting policies are the most critical to aid you in fully understanding and evaluating our financial condition and results of operations.\nRevenue Recognition\nWe generate revenue from product sales of our approved products and collaborative research and development agreements that we have entered or may enter into from time to time.\nNet Product Sales\nWe recognize revenue in accordance with the Financial Accounting Standards Board (\u201cFASB\u201d) Accounting Standards Codification (\u201cASC\u201d)\n605,\nRevenue Recognition\n, when the following criteria have been met: persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists; delivery has occurred and risk of loss has passed; the seller\u2019s price to the buyer is fixed or determinable and collectability is reasonably assured.  We determine that persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists based on written contracts that define the terms of the arrangements.  Pursuant to the contract terms, we determine when title to products and associated risk of loss has passed on to the customer.  We assess whether the price is fixed or determinable based on the payment terms associated with the transaction and whether the sales price is subject to refund or adjustment.  We assess collectability based primarily on the customer\u2019s payment history and creditworthiness.\nWe sell SPRIX Nasal Spray in the U.S. to a single specialty pharmaceutical distributor subject to rights of return. We have limited SPRIX Nasal Spray sales history under the current distribution model and pricing, and have determined that at this time we cannot reliably estimate expected returns of the product at the time of shipment. Accordingly, we defer recognition of revenue on product shipments of SPRIX Nasal Spray until the right of return no longer exists, which occurs at the earlier of the time SPRIX Nasal Spray units are dispensed through patient prescriptions or expiration of the right of return. Units dispensed are generally not subject to return, except in the rare cases where the product malfunctions or the product is damaged in transit. We calculate patient prescriptions dispensed using an analysis of third-party information. As of December 31, 2016, we had deferred revenue of $1.3 million related to sales of SPRIX Nasal Spray to its specialty pharmaceutical distributor.\nWe sell OXAYDO in the U.S. to several wholesalers, all subject to rights of return. We have limited OXAYDO sales history under the current distribution model and pricing, and have determined that at this time we cannot reliably estimate expected returns of the product at the time of shipment. Accordingly, we defer recognition of revenue on product shipments of OXAYDO until the right of return no longer exists, which occurs at the earlier of the time OXAYDO units are dispensed through patient prescriptions or expiration of the right of return. We calculate patient\n79\nTable of Contents\nprescriptions dispensed using an analysis of third-party information. As of December 31, 2016, we had deferred revenue of $2.6 million related to sales of OXAYDO to the wholesalers.\nThe following table presents an analysis of product sales allowances and accruals for the year ended December 31, 2016.\n(in thousands)\nFees and distribution costs\nCo-pay assistance\nTotal\nBalances at December 31, 2015\n$\u2014\n$240\n\t\t\t\t\n$240\n\t\t\t\t\nAllowances for current period sales\n1,839\n\t\t\t\t\n8,836\n\t\t\t\t\n10,675\n\t\t\t\t\nCredits or payments made for current period sales\n(1,839)\n\t\t\t\t\n(8,055)\n\t\t\t\t\n(9,894)\n\t\t\t\t\nBalance at December 31, 2016\n$\u2014\n$1,021\n\t\t\t\t\n$1,021\n\t\t\t\t\nTotal gross product sales\n$27,554\n\t\t\t\t\nTotal provision for product sales allowances and accruals as a percentage of total gross sales\n39%\n\t\t\t\t\nIntangible and Long Lived Assets\nIntangible assets consist of product rights related to the product acquisition of SPRIX Nasal Spray from Luitpold, product rights associated with the Collaboration and License Agreement with Acura to commercialize OXAYDO tablets, and in\u2010process research and development (\u201cIP R&D\u201d) related to our drug delivery platform technology.\nLong\u2010lived assets, including intangible assets and property and equipment, are assessed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount of the asset may not be recoverable. Recoverability of long\u2010lived assets that will continue to be used in our operations is measured by comparing the carrying amount of the asset to the forecasted undiscounted future cash flows related to that asset. In the event the carrying value of the asset exceeds the undiscounted future cash flows, and the carrying value is not considered recoverable, an impairment loss is measured as the excess of the asset\u2019s carrying value over its fair value, generally based on a discounted future cash flow method.\nEvents giving rise to impairment are an inherent risk in the pharmaceutical industry and are difficult to predict. Factors that we consider in deciding when to perform an impairment review include significant under\u2010performance of the asset in relation to expectations, significant negative industry or economic trends and significant changes or planned changes in our use of the assets. We have not recorded any impairment charges for the years ended December 31, 2014, 2015 and 2016.\nStock\u2010Based Compensation Expense\nWe apply the fair value recognition provisions of FASB ASC Topic 718,\nCompensation\u2014Stock Compensation\n.  Determining the amount of share-based compensation expense to be recorded requires us to develop estimates of the fair value of stock options as of their grant date. We recognize share-based compensation expense ratably over the requisite service period, which in most cases is the vesting period of the award. Calculating the fair value of share-based awards requires that we make highly subjective assumptions.\nWe use the Black-Scholes option pricing model to value our stock option awards. Use of this valuation methodology requires that we make assumptions as to the volatility of our common stock, the expected term of our stock\n80\nTable of Contents\noptions, and the risk-free interest rate for a period that approximates the expected term of our stock options and our expected dividend yield. Because we are a publicly held company with a limited operating history, we utilize data from a representative group of companies to estimate expected stock price volatility. We selected companies from the pharmaceutical industry with similar characteristics to us, including those in the early stage of product development and with a therapeutic focus, to comprise our representative group.\nWe use the simplified method as prescribed by the SEC Staff Accounting Bulletin (\u201cSAB\u201d) No. 107,\nShare-Based Payment\n, to calculate the expected term of stock option grants to employees as we do not have sufficient historical exercise data to provide a reasonable basis upon which to estimate the expected term of stock options granted to employees. We utilize a dividend yield of zero based on the fact that we have never paid cash dividends and have no current intention to pay cash dividends. The risk-free interest rate used for each grant is based on the U.S. Treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant for instruments with a similar expected life. The weighted-average assumptions used to estimate the fair value of stock options using the Black-Scholes option pricing model were as follows for the year ended December 31, 2014, 2015 and 2016.\n2014\n2015\n2016\nRisk-free interest rate\n1.81\n\t\t\t\t%\n1.76\n\t\t\t\t%\n1.66\n\t\t\t\t%\nExpected term of options (in years)\n6.24\n\t\t\t\t\n6.27\n\t\t\t\t\n6.19\n\t\t\t\t\nExpected volatility\n74.88\n\t\t\t\t%\n72.93\n\t\t\t\t%\n68.94\n\t\t\t\t%\nDividend yield\n\u2014\n\u2014\n\u2014\nConvertible Debt Accounting\nWe perform an assessment of all embedded features of a debt instrument to determine if (1) such features should be bifurcated and separately accounted for, and (2) if bifurcation requirements are met, whether such features should be classified and accounted for as equity or liability instruments. If the embedded feature meets the requirements to be bifurcated and accounted for as a liability, the fair value of the embedded feature is measured initially, included as a liability on our Consolidated Balance Sheet, and re-measured to fair value at each reporting period. Any changes in fair value are recorded in our Consolidated Statement of Operations. We monitor, on an ongoing basis, whether events or circumstances could give rise to a change in our classification of embedded features.\nWe determined the embedded conversion options in the 5.50% Convertible Senior Notes due 2020 (the \u201c5.50% Notes\u201d) are not required to be separately accounted for as derivatives. However, since the 5.50% Notes can be settled in cash or shares of our common stock or a combination of cash and shares of our common stock at our option, we are required to separate the 5.50% Notes into a liability and equity component. The carrying amount of the liability component is calculated by measuring the fair value of a similar liability that does not have an associated equity component. The carrying amount of the equity component representing the embedded conversion option is determined by deducting the fair value of the liability component from the initial proceeds. The excess of the principal amount of the liability component over its carrying amount is amortized to interest expense over the expected life of the 5.50% Notes using the effective interest method. The equity component is not re-measured as long as it continues to meet the conditions for equity classification for contracts in an entity\u2019s own equity.\nThe fair value of the liability component of the 5.50% Notes was estimated at $40.6 million at issuance in April 2016. Therefore, the difference between the $61.0 million face value of the 5.50% Notes and the $40.6 million estimated fair value of the liability component is being amortized to interest expense over the term of the 5.50% Notes through April 1, 2020 using the effective interest method.\nThe estimated fair value of the liability component at the date of issuance was determined using valuation models that are complex and subject to judgment. Significant assumptions within the valuation models included an implied credit spread, the expected volatility and dividend yield of our common stock and the risk-free interest rate for notes with a similar term.\n81\nTable of Contents\nThe 5.50% Notes are convertible prior to maturity, subject to certain conditions described below, into shares of our common stock.\nHolders may convert all or any portion of their 5.50% Notes, in multiples of $1,000 principal amount, at their option at any time prior to the close of business on the business day immediately preceding January 1, 2020 only under the following circumstances.\n\uf0b7\non or after the date that is six months after the last date of original issuance of the 5.50% Notes, if the last reported sale price of our common stock for at least 20 trading days (whether or not consecutive) during a period of 30 consecutive trading days ending within the five trading days immediately preceding a conversion date is greater than or equal to the conversion price for the notes on each applicable trading day;\n\uf0b7\nduring the five-business day period after any five consecutive trading day period, the measurement period, in which the trading price per $1,000 principal amount of the 5.50% Notes for each trading day of the measurement period was less than 98% of the product of the last reported sale price of our common stock and the conversion rate on each such trading day; or\n\uf0b7\nupon the occurrence of specified corporate events.\nWe will satisfy the conversion obligation by paying or delivering, as the case may be, cash, shares of our common stock or a combination thereof, at our election.\nOn a quarterly basis, we perform an assessment to determine whether the 5.50% Notes have become convertible at the option of the holder, based on meeting any of the conversion criteria described above. Should the 5.50% Notes become convertible, we then assess our intent and ability to settle the 5.50% Notes in cash, shares of our common stock, or a combination of cash and shares of our common stock.\nThe 5.50% Notes include an interest make-whole feature whereby if a noteholder converts any of the 5.50% Notes prior to April 1, 2018, we will, in addition to the other consideration payable or deliverable in connection with such conversion, make an interest make-whole payment to the converting holder equal to the sum of the present value of the remaining scheduled payments of interest that would have been made on the 5.50% Notes to be converted had such notes remained outstanding from the conversion date through April 1, 2018, computed using a discount rate equal to 2%. We have determined that this feature is an embedded derivative and have recognized the fair value of this derivative as a liability in our Consolidated Balance Sheets, with subsequent changes to fair value recorded through earnings at each reporting period on our Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Loss as change in fair value of derivative liabilities.  The fair value of this embedded derivative was determined based on a binomial tree lattice model.\nAccrued Research and Development Expenses\nAs part of the process of preparing our financial statements, we are required to estimate our accrued expenses, including clinical trial expenses. This process involves reviewing quotations and contracts, identifying services that have been performed on our behalf and estimating the level of service performed and the associated cost incurred for the service when we have not yet been invoiced or otherwise notified of the actual cost. The majority of our service providers invoice us monthly in arrears for services performed or when contractual milestones are met. We make estimates of our accrued expenses as of each balance sheet date in our financial statements based on facts and circumstances known to us at that time. We periodically confirm the accuracy of our estimates with the service providers and make adjustments if necessary. The significant estimates in our accrued research and development expenses are related to fees paid to vendors in connection with research and development activities for which we have not yet been invoiced. The financial terms of these agreements are subject to negotiation, vary from contract to contract and may result in uneven payment flows in accruing service fees, we estimate the time period over which services will be performed and the level of effort to be expended in each period. If the actual timing of the performance of services or the level of effort varies from our estimate, we will adjust the accrual accordingly. If we do not identify costs that we have begun to incur or if we underestimate or overestimate the level of services performed or the costs of these services, our\n82\nTable of Contents\nactual expenses could differ from our estimates. We do not anticipate the future settlement of existing accruals to differ materially from our estimates.\nIncome Taxes\nOur income tax expense, deferred tax assets and reserves for unrecognized tax benefits reflect management\u2019s best assessment of estimated future taxes to be paid. We are subject to income taxes in the U.S., Denmark, and the United Kingdom.  Significant judgments and estimates are required in determining the consolidated income tax expense, including a determination of whether and how much of a tax benefit taken by us in our tax filings or positions is more likely to be realized than not.\nWe believe that it is more likely than not that the benefit from some of our U.S. federal, U.S. state, Denmark, and U.K. net operating loss carryforwards will not be realized. At December 31, 2016, in recognition of this risk, we have provided a valuation allowance of approximately $53.7 million on the deferred tax assets relating to these net operating loss carryforwards and other deferred tax assets. If our assumptions change and we determine we will be able to realize these net operating losses, the tax benefits relating to any reversal of the valuation allowance on deferred tax assets at December 31, 2016 will be accounted for as a reduction of income tax expense.\nChanges in tax laws and rates could also affect recorded deferred tax assets and liabilities in the future. We are not aware of any such changes that would be expected to have a material effect on our results of operations, cash flows or financial position.\nWe recognize tax liabilities in accordance with ASC Topic 740 \u2013\nTax Provisions\nand we adjust these liabilities when our judgment changes as a result of the evaluation of new information not previously available. Due to the complexity of some of these uncertainties, the ultimate resolution may result in a payment that is materially different from our current estimate of the tax liabilities. These differences will be reflected as increases or decreases to income tax expense in the period in which they are determined.\n83\nTable of Contents\nResults of Operations\nComparison of Years Ended December 31, 2015 and 2016\n(in thousands)\nYear Ended\nDecember 31,\n2015\n2016\nChange\nRevenues\nNet product sales\n$4,184\n\t\t\t\t\n$16,864\n\t\t\t\t\n$12,680\n\t\t\t\t\nCollaboration revenues\n\u2014\n100\n\t\t\t\t\n100\n\t\t\t\t\nRelated party revenues\n18,646\n\t\t\t\t\n\u2014\n(18,646)\n\t\t\t\t\nTotal revenue\n22,830\n\t\t\t\t\n16,964\n\t\t\t\t\n(5,866)\n\t\t\t\t\nCost and Expenses\nCost of sales (excluding amortization of product rights)\n3,271\n\t\t\t\t\n3,660\n\t\t\t\t\n389\n\t\t\t\t\nAmortization of product rights\n1,958\n\t\t\t\t\n2,006\n\t\t\t\t\n48\n\t\t\t\t\nGeneral and administrative\n26,474\n\t\t\t\t\n30,670\n\t\t\t\t\n4,196\n\t\t\t\t\nSales and marketing\n16,289\n\t\t\t\t\n27,892\n\t\t\t\t\n11,603\n\t\t\t\t\nResearch and development\n27,054\n\t\t\t\t\n33,759\n\t\t\t\t\n6,705\n\t\t\t\t\nTotal costs and expenses\n75,046\n\t\t\t\t\n97,987\n\t\t\t\t\n22,941\n\t\t\t\t\nLoss from operations\n(52,216)\n\t\t\t\t\n(81,023)\n\t\t\t\t\n(28,807)\n\t\t\t\t\nOther (income) expense.\nChange in fair value of derivative liability\n(260)\n\t\t\t\t\n(644)\n\t\t\t\t\n(384)\n\t\t\t\t\nInterest expense, net\n7,477\n\t\t\t\t\n12,109\n\t\t\t\t\n4,632\n\t\t\t\t\nOther gain\n(864)\n\t\t\t\t\n(797)\n\t\t\t\t\n67\n\t\t\t\t\nLoss on foreign currency exchange\n82\n\t\t\t\t\n2\n\t\t\t\t\n(80)\n\t\t\t\t\n6,435\n\t\t\t\t\n10,670\n\t\t\t\t\n4,235\n\t\t\t\t\nLoss before provision for income taxes\n(58,651)\n\t\t\t\t\n(91,693)\n\t\t\t\t\n(33,042)\n\t\t\t\t\nProvision (benefit) for income taxes\n(718)\n\t\t\t\t\n(1,061)\n\t\t\t\t\n(343)\n\t\t\t\t\nNet loss\n$(57,933)\n\t\t\t\t\n$(90,632)\n\t\t\t\t\n$(32,699)\n\t\t\t\t\nNet product sales\nNet product sales increased from $4.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 to $16.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2016.  The increase was due to continued growth of SPRIX Nasal Spray product sales and a full year of OXAYDO product sales in 2016.\nCollaboration revenues\nThere were no collaboration revenues for the year ended December 31, 2015.  Collaboration revenues were $100,000 for the year ended December 31, 2016, and consisted entirely of revenues recognized under our SPRIX Nasal Spray marketing agreement with Septodont.\nRelated party revenues\nRelated party revenues for the year ended December 31, 2015 were $18.6 million due to the termination of the Shionogi agreement which resulted in the recognition of $16.9 million in related party revenues that otherwise would have been classified as deferred revenue as of December 31, 2015 and recognized as revenue over the life of the agreement.  There were no related party revenues for the year ended December 31, 2016, as a result of the termination of the Shionogi agreement in December 2015.  Refer to Note 15 \u2013 Acquisition and License and\n84\nTable of Contents\nCollaboration Agreements in the Notes to our Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information about the Shionogi agreement.\nCost of sales (excluding amortization of product rights)\nCost of sales (excluding amortization of product rights) was $3.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 related to the product sales of SPRIX Nasal Spray and OXAYDO, which began in 2015.  The cost of sales in 2015 included $1.6 million related to an inventory write down due to SPRIX Nasal Spray product expiration for product that was purchased from Luitpold as part of the initial acquisition of SPRIX Nasal Spray.\nCost of sales (excluding amortization of product rights) was $3.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2016.  The cost of sales in 2016 included $310,000 related to an inventory write down due to OXAYDO product expiration.\nCost of sales (excluding amortization of product rights) for SPRIX Nasal Spray reflects the fair value of finished goods inventory assumed as part of the SPRIX Nasal Spray acquisition as well as the average cost of inventory subsequently produced and dispensed to patients.  The cost of sales (excluding product amortization rights) for OXAYDO reflects the average costs of inventory dispensed to patients during the period.\nAmortization of product rights\nAmortization of product rights was $2.0 million for each of the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2016 was composed, in each case, of $1.1 million and $903,000, related to intangible assets acquired in the OXAYDO License and SPRIX Nasal Spray acquisition, respectively.\nGeneral and administrative expenses\nGeneral and administrative expenses increased by $4.2 million, or 15.8%, from $26.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 to $30.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2016.\nThis increase was attributable to increases in salary, benefits and stock-based compensation expense of $4.5 million due to an increase in headcount.  There were also increased professional and administrative fees of $4.0 million due to increased medical publication expenses, depreciation expense associated with the manufacturing equipment and regulatory professional fees\nrelated to preparation for the ARYMO ER FDA Advisory Committee meeting that was\nheld in 2016. These increases were partially offset by a $4.1 million decrease related to the in regulatory filing fees for ARYMO ER and SPRIX Nasal Spray that were incurred during 2015. The regulatory fees during 2016 were composed of annual Pharmaceutical Drug User Fee Act (\u201cPDUFA\u201d) product and establishment fees.\nSales and marketing expenses\nSales and marketing expenses increased by $11.6 million, or 71.2%, from $16.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 to $27.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2016.\nThis increase was attributable to the continued growth of our commercial operations in the United States. There was an increase of $5.9 million in sales force expenses due to the expansion of the contracted sales force. There was a full year of sales force activities during 2016 compared to 6 months of sales force activity during 2015.  As of December 31, 2015 and 2016, we had a contract sales force of 43 and 64 territory managers, respectively. There were also increases in salary and benefits of $1.2 million, and increases in promotional expenses for OXAYDO of $1.0 million and launch planning expenses for ARYMO ER of $1.1 million.\nIn January 2017, we internalized our commercial sales force resulting in the creation of a specialty sales force of approximately 72 people.  We believe the internalization of our sales force will not have a materially impact on our sales and marketing expenses in 2017.\n85\nTable of Contents\nResearch and development expenses\nResearch and development expenses increased by $6.7 million, or 24.8%, from $27.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 to $33.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2016.\nThis increase was driven primarily by increases in our development program expenses of $6.3 million related to Egalet-002 Phase 3 clinical efficacy and safety trials and Human Abuse Potential (\u201cHAP\u201d) trials, and $4.3 million related to OXAYDO bioequivalence and HAP trials, respectively. These increases were partially offset by a decrease in ARYMO ER development program expenses of $2.5 million and a decrease in other research and development activities of $1.8 million.\nChange in fair value of derivative liability\nThe interest make whole provision of the 5.50% Notes is subject to re-measurement at each balance sheet date and we recognize any change in fair value in our statements of operations and comprehensive loss as a change in fair value of the derivative liability.   During the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2016, we had a gain of $260,000 and $644,000, respectively, as a result of the change in the fair value of our derivative liability.  The change in fair value of the derivative liability is due the changes in the value of our common stock during the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2016.\nInterest expense, net\nInterest expense increased from $7.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 to $12.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2016.  Interest expense for the year ended December 31, 2015 was primarily attributable to the interest expense on the 5.50% convertible notes and the Hercules Loan Agreement.\nInterest expense for the year ended December 31, 2016 primarily consisted of interest expense on the Hercules Loan Agreement prior to its termination, the 5.50% Notes and the 13% Senior Secured Notes (the \u201c13% Notes\u201d).  The interest expense of $12.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 was comprised of $6.1 million of coupon interest, debt discount amortization of $5.7 million and $800,000 in debt extinguishment costs related to the repayment in full of the Hercules Loan Agreement.

The change was primarily attributable a change in the average rates of currency in which we transacted during 2015 compared to 2016.\nProvision (benefit) for income taxes\nWe had a tax benefit of $718,000 during the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to a tax benefit of $1.1 million during the year ended December 31, 2016. The tax benefit in each of the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2016 relates to a state tax benefit associated with the 5.50% Notes.\n86\nTable of Contents\nComparison of Years Ended December 31, 2014 and 2015\n(in thousands)\nYear Ended\nDecember 31,\n2014\n2015\nChange\nRevenues\nNet product sales\n$\u2014\n$4,184\n\t\t\t\t\n$4,184\n\t\t\t\t\nCollaboration revenues\n\u2014\n\u2014\n\u2014\nRelated party revenues\n1,920\n\t\t\t\t\n18,646\n\t\t\t\t\n16,726\n\t\t\t\t\nTotal revenue\n1,920\n\t\t\t\t\n22,830\n\t\t\t\t\n20,910\n\t\t\t\t\nCost and Expenses\nCost of sales (excluding amortization of product rights)\n\u2014\n3,271\n\t\t\t\t\n3,271\n\t\t\t\t\nAmortization of product rights\n\u2014\n1,958\n\t\t\t\t\n1,958\n\t\t\t\t\nGeneral and administrative\n15,715\n\t\t\t\t\n26,474\n\t\t\t\t\n10,759\n\t\t\t\t\nSales and marketing\n946\n\t\t\t\t\n16,289\n\t\t\t\t\n15,343\n\t\t\t\t\nResearch and development\n22,395\n\t\t\t\t\n27,054\n\t\t\t\t\n4,659\n\t\t\t\t\nTotal costs and expenses\n39,056\n\t\t\t\t\n75,046\n\t\t\t\t\n35,990\n\t\t\t\t\nLoss from operations\n(37,136)\n\t\t\t\t\n(52,216)\n\t\t\t\t\n(15,080)\n\t\t\t\t\nOther (income) expense.\nChange in fair value of derivative liability\n\u2014\n(260)\n\t\t\t\t\n(260)\n\t\t\t\t\nInterest expense, net\n7,079\n\t\t\t\t\n7,477\n\t\t\t\t\n398\n\t\t\t\t\nOther (gain) loss\n(1,045)\n\t\t\t\t\n(864)\n\t\t\t\t\n181\n\t\t\t\t\nLoss (gain) on foreign currency exchange\n(3)\n\t\t\t\t\n82\n\t\t\t\t\n85\n\t\t\t\t\n6,031\n\t\t\t\t\n6,435\n\t\t\t\t\n404\n\t\t\t\t\nLoss before provision for income taxes\n(43,167)\n\t\t\t\t\n(58,651)\n\t\t\t\t\n(15,484)\n\t\t\t\t\nProvision (benefit) for income taxes\n47\n\t\t\t\t\n(718)\n\t\t\t\t\n(765)\n\t\t\t\t\nNet loss\n$(43,214)\n\t\t\t\t\n$(57,933)\n\t\t\t\t\n$(14,719)\n\t\t\t\t\nNet product sales\nNet product sales increased from $0 for the year ended December 31, 2014 to $4.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2015.  The increase was due to the launch of SPRIX Nasal Spray and OXAYDO in 2015.\nRelated party revenues\nRelated party revenues increased from $1.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2014 to $18.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2015.  The increase was due to the termination of the collaboration agreement with Shionogi which resulted in the recognition of $16.9 million in related party revenues that otherwise would have been classified as deferred revenue as of December 31, 2015 and recognized as revenue over the life of the agreement.\nCost of sales (excluding amortization of product rights)\nCost of sales (excluding amortization of product rights) were $3.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 related to the sales of SPRIX Nasal Spray and OXAYDO, which began in 2015.  The cost of sales in 2015 included $1.6 million related to an inventory write down predominantly due to SPRIX Nasal Spray product expiration which was purchased from Luitpold as part of the initial acquisition of the product. The cost of sales for SPRIX Nasal Spray (excluding amortization of product rights) reflects the fair value of finished goods inventory that was acquired as part of the acquisition and was dispensed to patients during the period. The cost of sales for OXAYDO (excluding amortization of product rights) reflects the average costs of inventory dispensed to patients during the period.\n87\nTable of Contents\nAmortization of product rights\nAmortization of product rights was $2.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 and was comprised of $1.1 million and $903,000 related to intangible assets acquired in the OXAYDO license and SPRIX Nasal Spray acquisition, respectively. There was no intangible amortization in 2014.\nGeneral and administrative expenses\nGeneral and administrative expenses increased by $10.8 million, or 68.5%, from $15.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2014 to $26.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2015. This was primarily attributable to FDA regulatory fees of $3.9 million, increases in salary and benefits of $3.8 million, due to an increase in headcount, as well as professional and administrative fees of $3.9 million as we expanded our operations in 2015. These increases were offset by a decrease in stock compensation expense of $1.1 million due to the timing of restricted stock vesting schedules.\nSales and marketing expenses\nSales and marketing expenses increased by $15.3 million, from $946,000 for the year ended December 31, 2014 to $16.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 related to the establishment of the commercial operations in the United States and launch activities for SPRIX and OXAYDO. Expenses for the year ended December 31, 2015 consisted primarily of $8.3 million in salary, benefits and our contract sales force as well as sales and marketing operations for SPRIX and OXAYDO of $4.7 million.  Sales and marketing costs were de minimis for 2014.\nResearch and development expenses\nResearch and development expenses increased by $4.7 million, or 20.8%, from $22.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2014 to $27.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2015. This increase was driven primarily by an increase in our development costs for Egalet-002 of $8.2 million and was offset by decrease in ARYMO ER development expenses of $2.8 million and a decrease in stock compensation expense of $2.9 million due to timing of restricted stock vesting schedules.\nChange in fair value of derivative liability\nThe interest make whole provision of the 5.50% Notes is subject to re-measurement at each balance sheet date and we recognize any change in fair value in our statements of operations and comprehensive loss as a change in fair value of the derivative liability.  The change in the fair value of the derivative liability of $260,000 is due primarily to the decrease in the value of our common stock during the year ended December 31, 2015 following the issuance of the 5.50% Notes.  There was no change in derivative liability for the year ended December 31, 2014.\nInterest expense, net\nInterest expense increased from $7.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2014 to $7.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2015. Interest expense for the year ended December 31, 2014 was primarily attributable to the recognition of the unamortized premium upon conversion of related party senior convertible debt in connection with our initial public offering in February 2014. Interest expense for the year ended December 31, 2015 was primarily attributable to the interest expense on the 5.50% convertible notes and the Hercules loan, Refer to Note 9 \u2014 Long Term Debt in the Notes to our Consolidated Financial Statements, for additional information about our long term debt at December 31, 2015.\n88\nTable of Contents\nOther gain\nOther gain was $1.0 million and $864,000 for the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2015, respectively, and in both years consisted entirely of a Danish research and development tax credit.\nLoss (gain) on foreign currency exchange\nWe recognized a gain on foreign currency exchange of $3,000 during the year ended December 31, 2014 and a loss of $82,000 during the year ended December 31, 2015. The change was primarily attributable a change in the average rates of currency in which we transacted during 2014 when compared to 2015.\nProvision for income taxes\nWe had a provision for income taxes of $47,000 during the year ended December 31, 2014 and a tax benefit of $718,000 during the year ended December 31, 2015.  The tax benefit in the year ended December 31, 2015 relates to a state tax benefit associated with the 5.50% Notes.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nSince our inception, we have incurred net losses and generally negative cash flows from our operations. We incurred net losses of $57.9 million and $90.6 million for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2016, respectively. Our operating activities used $38.9 million and $72.9 million of cash during the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2016, respectively. At December 31, 2016, we had an accumulated deficit of $225.2 million, a working capital surplus of $68.3 million and cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities totaling $86.8 million.\nFrom our inception and through the completion of our initial public offering (\u201cIPO\u201d) on February 11, 2014, we received gross proceeds of $31.1 million from the issuance of preferred stock and convertible debt.\nOn February 11, 2014, 4,200,000 shares of our common stock were sold at an IPO price of $12.00 per share, for aggregate gross proceeds of $50.4 million. On March 7, 2014, in connection with the exercise by the underwriters of a portion of the over-allotment option granted to them in connection with the IPO, 630,000 additional shares of our common stock were sold at the IPO price of $12.00 per share, for aggregate gross proceeds of approximately $7.6 million. In addition, as part of the IPO, we converted all of our convertible preferred stock and related party senior convertible debt into 5,329,451 and 2,585,745 shares of common stock, respectively. Also, Shionogi, our previous collaboration partner, purchased 1,250,000 shares of our common stock in a separate private placement concurrent with the completion of the IPO at a price per share equal to $12.00 per share, for aggregate gross proceeds of $15.0 million. In addition, the 2013 related party senior convertible debt holders automatically exercised 600,000 warrants for shares of common stock at an exercise price of $0.0083 per share.\nIn January 2015, we entered into the Loan and Security Agreement, which was subsequently amended in December 2015 (as amended, the \u201cHercules Loan Agreement\u201d), with Hercules Technology Growth Capital, Inc. (\u201cHercules\u201d) and certain other lenders, pursuant to which we borrowed $15.0 million under a term loan. On August 31, 2016, we repaid all outstanding obligations under the Loan Agreement with the proceeds of the 13% Notes.  As a result of the repayment, we recorded debt extinguishment costs of $800,000 during year ended December 31, 2016 which is classified as interest expense on our Consolidated Statement of Operations.\nIn April 2015, we issued through a private placement $60.0 million in aggregate principal amount of the 5.50% Notes.  On May 6, 2015, we issued an additional $1.0 million in principal amount pursuant to the initial purchasers\u2019 exercise of their 30-day over-allotment for the aggregate gross proceeds of $61.0 million. Interest on the 5.50% Notes is payable semi-annually in arrears on April 1 and October 1 of each year. Refer to Note 9 \u2014 Long Term Debt in the Notes to our Consolidated Financial Statements, for additional information.\n89\nTable of Contents\nOn July 2, 2015, we entered into a sales agreement to offer shares of our common stock from time to time in an \u201cat-the-market\u201d offering.  We may offer and sell shares of common stock for an aggregate offering price of up to $30.0 million.  No shares have been sold pursuant to this agreement as of the date of this report.  The agreement does not have an expiration date, but can be canceled at any time for convenience with 10 days written notice.\nOn July 31, 2015, we completed an underwritten public offering of 7,666,667 shares of common stock (including the exercise in full of the underwriters\u2019 option to purchase additional shares) at an offering price of $11.25 per share for gross proceeds of $86.3 million.  The net offering proceeds from the sale were $80.8 million, after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions of $5.2 million and offering costs of $293,000.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2015, we had cash outflows related to the purchase of SPRIX Nasal Spray and license of OXAYDO of $8.1 million and $7.7 million, respectively. Refer to Note 15 - Acquisitions and License and Collaboration Agreements in the Notes to our Consolidated Financial Statements, for additional information.\nThrough December 31, 2016 we have also financed our operation with the $4.1 million in payments from our collaborative research and development agreements along with aggregate upfront and milestone payments of $20.0 million from Shionogi under a collaboration agreement.  Our collaboration with Shionogi was terminated in December 2015.\nIn August 2016, we issued $40.0 million in aggregate principal amount of the 13% Notes and issued an additional $40.0 million in aggregate principal amount when we obtained approval from the FDA of our product candidate ARYMO ER, in January 2017, after the date of this report.  Interest on the 13% Notes accrues at a rate of 13% per annum and is payable semi-annually in arrears on March 20\nand September 20\nof each year (each, a \u201cPayment Date\u201d) commencing on March 20, 2017.  On each Payment Date commencing on March 20, 2018 we will pay an installment of principal on the 13% Notes in an amount equal to 15% (or 17% if certain sales targets are not met) of the aggregate net sales of OXAYDO, SPRIX Nasal Spray, ARYMO ER and Egalet-002, if approved, for the two consecutive fiscal quarter period most recently ended, less the amount of interest paid on the Notes on such Payment Date.\nWe believe that our existing cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities will be sufficient to fund our projected operating requirements through at least June 30, 2018.\nCash Flows\nComparison of Years Ended December 31, 2015 and 2016\nThe following table summarizes our cash flows for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2016.\n(in thousands)\nYear Ended\nDecember 31,\n2015\n2016\nNet cash provided by (used in).\nOperating activities\n$(38,906)\n\t\t\t\t\n$(72,867)\n\t\t\t\t\nInvesting activities\n(119,787)\n\t\t\t\t\n48,865\n\t\t\t\t\nFinancing activities\n152,293\n\t\t\t\t\n21,647\n\t\t\t\t\nEffect of foreign currency translation on cash\n327\n\t\t\t\t\n45\n\t\t\t\t\nNet decrease in cash\n$(6,073)\n\t\t\t\t\n$(2,310)\n\t\t\t\t\nCash Flows from Operating Activities\nNet cash used in operating activities was $38.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 and consisted primarily of a net loss of $57.9 million. These outflows were partially offset by $5.2 million in stock-based compensation expense, $4.0 million of non-cash interest and debt discount amortization, $3.0 million of noncash depreciation and amortization expense and $7.0 million in net cash inflows from changes in operating assets and liabilities. Cash inflows from changes in operating assets and liabilities were primarily due to an increase in accounts\n90\nTable of Contents\npayable and accrued expenses of $6.3 million primarily driven by our commercial operations, clinical studies and manufacturing operations, and an increase due to deferred revenue related to the product sales of SPRIX Nasal Spray and OXAYDO.\nNet cash used in operating activities was $72.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 and consisted primarily of a net loss of $90.6 million. This net loss was partially offset by $6.3 million in stock-based compensation expense, $5.9 million of non-cash interest and debt discount amortization, $4.1 million of noncash depreciation and amortization expense and $1.7 million in net cash inflows from changes in operating assets and liabilities. Cash inflows from changes in operating assets and liabilities were primarily due to an increase in accrued expenses of $10.5 million, primarily driven by our commercial operations, clinical studies and interest obligations, and a decrease in deposits and other assets of $1.4 million.  These inflows were partially offset by a decrease in deferred revenue of $6.2 million related to the product sales of SPRIX Nasal Spray and OXAYDO.\nCash Flows from Investing Activities\nNet cash used in investing activities for the year ended December 31, 2015 was $119.8 million.  Cash outflows for the year ended December 31, 2015 consisted of the purchase of investments for $110.2 million, the purchase of SPRIX Nasal Spray for $8.1 million, the in-license of OXAYDO for $7.7 million, and payments and deposits for property and equipment of $4.0 million.  These outflows were partially offset by inflows from the maturity and sales of investments of $10.2 million.\nNet cash provided by investing activities for the year ended December 31, 2016 was $48.9 million.  Cash inflows consisted of $115.6 million provided by the sale and maturity of investments.  These outflows were partially offset by cash outflows for purchases of investments of $59.5 million and purchases of property and equipment of $7.2 million, primarily related to the expansion of our commercial manufacturing capability at our third-party contract manufacturer, Halo Pharmaceuticals.\nCash Flows from Financing Activities\nNet cash provided by financing activities was $152.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 and consisted of the net proceeds from Hercules Loan Agreement of $14.7 million, net proceeds from the issuance of the 5.50% Notes of $56.7 million and the net proceeds from the July 2015 equity offering of $80.8 million.\nNet cash provided by financing activities was $21.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 and consisted of the net proceeds from the first tranche of the 13% Notes of $37.2 million, partially offset by the $15.9 million repayment of the Hercules Loan Agreement.\nComparison of Years Ended December 31, 2014 and 2015\nThe following table summarizes our cash flows for the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2015.\n(in thousands)\nYear Ended\nDecember 31,\n2014\n2015\nNet cash provided by (used in).\nOperating activities\n$(25,074)\n\t\t\t\t\n$(38,906)\n\t\t\t\t\nInvesting activities\n(3,743)\n\t\t\t\t\n(119,787)\n\t\t\t\t\nFinancing activities\n66,982\n\t\t\t\t\n152,293\n\t\t\t\t\nEffect of foreign currency translation on cash\n(1,127)\n\t\t\t\t\n327\n\t\t\t\t\nNet increase (decrease) in cash\n$37,038\n\t\t\t\t\n$(6,073)\n\t\t\t\t\n91\nTable of Contents\nCash Flows from Operating Activities\nNet cash used in operating activities was $25.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2014 and consisted primarily of a net loss of $43.2 million. These outflows were partially offset by $641,000 of noncash depreciation and amortization expense, $8.5 million in stock-based compensation expense, $7.0 million in accretion of the debt premium to interest expense, and $2.0 million in net cash inflows from changes in operating assets and liabilities. Cash inflows from changes in operating assets and liabilities were primarily due to an increase in accounts payable and accrued expense of $4.7 million due to an increase in our expense base and the timing in which we paid our consultants. We also had a decrease in our prepaid expenses of $540,000.\nNet cash used in operating activities was $38.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 and consisted primarily of a net loss of $57.9 million. These outflows were partially offset by $5.2 million in stock-based compensation expense, $4.0 million of non-cash interest and debt discount amortization, $3.0 million of noncash depreciation and amortization expense and $7.0 million in net cash inflows from changes in operating assets and liabilities. Cash inflows from changes in operating assets and liabilities were primarily due to an increase in accounts payable and accrued expenses of $6.3 million primarily driven by our commercial operations, clinical studies and manufacturing operations, and an increase due to deferred revenue related to the product sales of SPRIX Nasal Spray and OXAYDO.\nCash Flows from Investing Activities\nNet cash used in investing activities for the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2015 was $3.7 million and $119.8 million, respectively. Cash flows for the year ended December 2014 consisted primarily of purchases of property and equipment as well as deposits on future related purchases.  Cash outflows for the year ended December 31, 2015 consisted of the purchase of investments for $110.2 million, purchase of SPRIX Nasal Spray for $8.1 million, license of OXAYDO for $7.7 million, and payments and deposits for property and equipment of $4.0 million.  These outflows were partially offset by inflows from the maturity and sales of investment of $10.2 million.\nCash Flows from Financing Activities\nNet cash provided by financing activities was $67.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2014 and consisted primarily of $53.0 million in proceeds from the completion of our IPO in February of 2014. There were additional proceeds of $14.0 million from the issuance of common stock in connection with our concurrent private placement with Shionogi.\nNet cash provided by financing activities was $152.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 and consisted of the net proceeds from Hercules Loan Agreement of $14.7 million, net proceeds from the issuance of the 5.50% Notes of $56.7 million and the net proceeds from the July 2015 equity offering of $80.8 million.\nOperating and Capital Expenditure Requirements\nWe have not achieved profitability since our inception and we expect to continue to incur net losses for the foreseeable future. Our primary uses of capital are, and we expect will continue to be, compensation and related expenses, sales and marketing expenses, research and development expenses, commercial infrastructure development, legal and other regulatory expense, business development opportunities and general overhead costs, included interest and principal repayments on our outstanding debt. We expect our cash expenditures to increase in the near term as we continue to grow our commercialization activities around SPRIX Nasal Spray, OXAYDO and ARYMO ER.\nBecause our product candidates are in various stages of clinical and preclinical development and the outcome of these efforts is uncertain, we cannot estimate the actual amounts necessary to successfully complete the development and commercialization of our product candidates or whether, or when, we may achieve profitability. Until such time, if ever, as we can generate substantial product revenues, we expect to finance our cash needs through a combination of equity or debt financings and collaboration arrangements. In order to meet these additional cash requirements, we may seek to sell\n92\nTable of Contents\nadditional equity or convertible debt securities that may result in dilution to our stockholders.  The indenture governing the 13% Notes contains covenants that restrict our ability to issue additional indebtedness.  However, if we raise additional funds through the issuance of convertible debt securities, these securities could have rights senior to those of our common stock and could contain covenants that restrict our operations. If we raise additional funds through collaboration arrangements in the future, we may have to relinquish valuable rights to our technologies, future revenue streams or product candidates or grant licenses on terms that may not be favorable to us.  We may also seek to raise additional financing through the issuance of debt which, if available, may involve agreements that include restrictive covenants limiting our ability to take important actions, such as incurring additional debt, making capital expenditures or declaring dividends. There can be no assurance that we will be able to obtain additional equity or debt financing on terms acceptable to us, if at all. If we are unable to raise capital when needed or on attractive terms, we could be forced to delay, reduce or eliminate our research and development programs or any future commercialization efforts or grant rights to develop and market product candidates that we would otherwise prefer to develop and market ourselves.\nWe believe that our existing capital resources, including the net proceeds from the issuance of the 5.50% Notes, the issuance of the 13% Notes, our July 2015 equity offering, and net revenue from our approved products will be sufficient to fund our operations at least through June 30, 2018.  However, our future operating and capital requirements will depend on many factors, including.\n\u00b7\nthe commercial success of our approved products\n\u00b7\nthe results of our clinical trials;\n\u00b7\nthe costs, timing and outcome of regulatory review;\n\u00b7\nthe cost of our current commercialization activities, including marketing, sales and distribution costs, as well as, commercialization activities for any future product candidates that are approved for sale;\n\u00b7\nour ability to establish collaborations or product acquisitions on favorable terms, if at all;\n\u00b7\nthe scope, progress, results and costs of product development of our product candidates; and\n\u00b7\nthe costs of preparing, filing and prosecuting patent applications, maintaining and protecting our intellectual property rights and defending intellectual property-related claims.\nPlease see \u201cRisk Factors\u201d for additional risks associated with our substantial capital requirements.\nContractual Obligations and Commitments\nThe following table represents our contractual obligations and commitments as of December 31, 2016.\n(in thousands)\nPayments Due By Period\nLess than\nMore than\nTotal\n1 year\n1 to 3 years\n3 to 5 years\n5 years\nOperating lease obligations(1)\n$2,976\n\t\t\t\t\n$733\n\t\t\t\t\n$1,056\n\t\t\t\t\n$1,095\n\t\t\t\t\n$92\n\t\t\t\t\nHercules debt (2)\n\u2014\n\u2014\n\u2014\n\u2014\n\u2014\n13% Notes (3)\n53,966\n\t\t\t\t\n5,373\n\t\t\t\t\n39,861\n\t\t\t\t\n8,732\n\t\t\t\t\n\u2014\n5.50% Notes (4)\n72,743\n\t\t\t\t\n3,355\n\t\t\t\t\n6,710\n\t\t\t\t\n62,678\n\t\t\t\t\n\u2014\nOther (5)\n5\n\t\t\t\t\n4\n\t\t\t\t\n1\n\t\t\t\t\n\u2014\n\u2014\nTotal\n$129,690\n\t\t\t\t\n$9,465\n\t\t\t\t\n$47,628\n\t\t\t\t\n$72,505\n\t\t\t\t\n$92\n\t\t\t\t\n(1)\nOperating lease obligations reflect our obligation to make payments in connection with the leases for our office space.\n93\nTable of Contents\n(2)\nOn August 31, 2016, we repaid all outstanding obligations under the Loan Agreement with Hercules with proceeds from the issuance of the 13% Notes.\n(3)\nOn August 31, 2016, we completed the initial closing of our offering of up to $80.0 million of the 13% Notes at which we issued $40.0 million in aggregate principal amount of the 13% Notes.  Interest on the 13% Notes accrues at a rate of 13% per annum and is payable semi-annually in arrears on March 20 and September 20 of each year (each, a \u201cPayment Date\u201d) commencing on March 20, 2017. On each Payment Date commencing on March 20, 2018, we will also pay an installment of principal of the 13% Notes pursuant to a straight-line fixed amortization schedule.\nIn January, 2017, we issued an additional $40.0 million aggregate principal amount of the 13% Notes after we obtained FDA approval of ARYMOTM ER.  The above table does not reflect the additional $40.0 million in aggregate principal amount as ARYMO ER was approved after the date of this report. Following the approval of ARYMO ER from the FDA, in lieu of the straight-line fixed amortization schedule, on each Payment Date commencing on March 20, 2018, we will pay an installment of principal on the 13% Notes in an amount equal to 15% (or 17% if certain sales targets are not met) of the aggregate net sales of OXAYDO, SPRIX Nasal Spray, ARYMO ER and Egalet-002, if approved, for the two consecutive fiscal quarter period most recently ended, less the amount of interest paid on the 13% Notes on such Payment Date.  This payment schedule is not reflected in the above tables, as it represents our obligations as of December 31, 2016, prior to the approval of ARYMO ER by the FDA.\n(4)\nIn April 1, 2015, we issued, through a private placement, $60.0 million in aggregate principal amount of the 5.50% Notes. On May 6, 2015, we issued an additional $1.0 million in principal amount pursuant to the initial purchasers\u2019 exercise of their 30-day over-allotment for aggregate gross proceeds of $61.0 million.  Interest on the 5.50% Notes is payable semi-annually in arrears on April 1 and October 1 of each year, commencing October 1, 2015.\n(5)\nWe have employment agreements with our executive officers that require the funding of a specific level of payments if specified events occur, such as a change in control or termination without cause. However, because of the contingent nature of those payments, they are not presented in the table.\nIn addition, in the course of normal business operations, we have agreements with contract service providers to assist in the performance of our research and development, commercial and manufacturing activities. We can elect to discontinue the work under these agreements at any time. We could also enter into additional collaborative research, contract research, manufacturing and supplier agreements in the future, which may require upfront payments or long\u2010term commitments of cash.\nPurchase Commitments\nAs of December 31, 2016, we have no material non\u2010cancelable purchase commitments with service providers as we have generally contracted on a cancelable purchase order basis.

See also \u0093Cautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements\u0094 preceding Part I.\nOverview\nStrategic Storage Trust II,\nInc., a Maryland corporation (the \u0093Company\u0094), was formed on January 8, 2013 under the Maryland General Corporation Law for the purpose of engaging in the business of investing in self storage facilities and related self storage real\nestate investments. Our\nyear-end\nis December 31. As used in this report, \u0093we,\u0094 \u0093us,\u0094 \u0093our,\u0094 and \u0093Company\u0094 refer to Strategic Storage Trust II, Inc. and each of our\nsubsidiaries.\nSmartStop Asset Management, LLC (our \u0093Sponsor\u0094), is the sponsor of our Offering (as defined below). Our Sponsor\nbecame our sponsor on October 1, 2015 in connection with the merger of SmartStop Self Storage, Inc. into Extra Space Storage, Inc. Our Sponsor owns 97.5% of the economic interests (and 100% of the voting membership interests) of Strategic\nStorage Advisor II, LLC, a Delaware limited liability company (our \u0093Advisor\u0094) and owns 100% of Strategic Storage Property Management II, LLC, a Delaware limited liability company (our \u0093Property Manager\u0094). See Note 1 of the Notes\nto the Consolidated Statements contained in this report for further details about our affiliates.\n46\nTable of Contents\nOn January 10, 2014, we commenced a public offering of a maximum of $1.0 billion in\ncommon shares for sale to the public (the \u0093Primary Offering\u0094) and $95.0 million in common shares for sale pursuant to our distribution reinvestment plan (collectively, the \u0093Offering\u0094). On May 23, 2014, we satisfied the\n$1.5 million minimum offering requirements of our Offering and commenced formal operations. On September 28, 2015, we revised our Primary Offering and offered two classes of shares of common stock: Class A common stock, $0.001 par\nvalue per share (the \u0093Class A Shares\u0094) and Class T common stock, $0.001 par value per share (the \u0093Class T Shares\u0094). As of December 31, 2016, we had sold approximately 47 million Class A Shares and\napproximately 7 million Class T Shares in our Offering for gross proceeds of approximately $481 million and approximately $67 million, respectively. Our Primary Offering terminated on January 9, 2017. In preparation for the\ntermination of our Offering, on November 30, 2016, we filed with the SEC a Registration Statement on Form\nS-3,\nwhich registered up to an additional $100.9 million in shares under our distribution\nreinvestment plan (our \u0093DRP Offering\u0094). The DRP Offering may be terminated at any time upon 10 days\u0092 prior written notice to stockholders.\nAs of December 31, 2016, we owned 77 self storage properties located in 14 states (Alabama, California, Colorado, Florida, Illinois,\nIndiana, Maryland, Michigan, New Jersey, Nevada, North Carolina, Ohio, South Carolina, and Washington) and Ontario, Canada (the Greater Toronto Area) comprising of approximately 46,920 units and approximately 5.5 million rentable square feet.\nCritical Accounting Policies\nWe have established accounting policies which conform to generally accepted accounting principles (\u0093GAAP\u0094). Preparing financial\nstatements in conformity with GAAP requires management to use judgment in the application of accounting policies, including making estimates and assumptions. Following is a discussion of the estimates and assumptions used in setting accounting\npolicies that we consider critical in the presentation of our financial statements. Many estimates and assumptions involved in the application of GAAP may have a material impact on our financial condition or operating performance, or on the\ncomparability of such information to amounts reported for other periods, because of the subjectivity and judgment required to account for highly uncertain items or the susceptibility of such items to change. These estimates and assumptions affect\nour reported amounts of assets and liabilities, our disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the dates of the financial statements and our reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the period covered by this report. If\nmanagement\u0092s judgment or interpretation of the facts and circumstances relating to various transactions had been different, it is possible that different accounting policies would have been applied or different amounts of assets, liabilities,\nrevenues and expenses would have been recorded, thus resulting in a materially different presentation of the financial statements or materially different amounts being reported in the financial statements. Additionally, other companies may use\ndifferent estimates and assumptions that may impact the comparability of our financial condition and results of operations to those companies.\nWe believe that our critical accounting policies include the following: real estate purchase price allocations; the evaluation of whether any\nof our long-lived assets have been impaired; the determination of the useful lives of our long-lived assets; and the evaluation of the consolidation of our interests in joint ventures. The following discussion of these policies supplements, but does\nnot supplant the description of our significant accounting policies, as contained in Note 2 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements contained in this report, and is intended to present our analysis of the uncertainties involved in\narriving upon and applying each policy.\nReal Estate Purchase Price Allocation\nWe allocate the purchase prices of acquired properties based on a number of estimates and assumptions. We allocate the purchase prices to the\ntangible and intangible assets acquired and the liabilities assumed based on estimated fair values. These estimated fair values are based upon comparable market sales information for land and estimates of depreciated replacement cost of equipment,\nbuilding and site improvements. Acquisitions of portfolios of properties are allocated to the individual properties based upon an income approach or a cash flow analysis using appropriate risk adjusted capitalization rates which we estimate based\nupon the relative size, age, and location of the individual property along with actual historical and estimated occupancy and rental rate levels, and other relevant factors. If available, and determined by management to be appropriate, appraised\nvalues are used, rather than these estimated values. Because we believe that substantially all of the leases in place at properties we acquire will be at market rates, as the majority of the leases are\nmonth-to-month\ncontracts, we do not expect to allocate any portion of the purchase prices to above or below market leases. The determination of market rates is also subject to a number of estimates and\nassumptions. Our allocations of purchase prices could result in a materially different presentation of the financial statements or materially different amounts being reported in the financial statements, as such allocations may vary dramatically\nbased on the estimates and assumptions we use.\n47\nTable of Contents\nImpairment of Long-Lived Assets\nThe majority of our assets consist of long-lived real estate assets as well as intangible assets related to our acquisitions. We evaluate such\nassets for impairment based on events and changes in circumstances that may arise in the future and that may impact the carrying amounts of our long-lived assets. When indicators of potential impairment are present, we will assess the recoverability\nof the particular asset by determining whether the carrying value of the asset will be recovered, through an evaluation of the undiscounted future operating cash flows expected from the use of the asset and its eventual disposition. This evaluation\nis based on a number of estimates and assumptions. Based on this evaluation, if the expected undiscounted future cash flows do not exceed the carrying value, we will adjust the value of the long-lived asset and recognize an impairment loss. Our\nevaluation of the impairment of long-lived assets could result in a materially different presentation of the financial statements or materially different amounts being reported in the financial statements, as the amount of impairment loss, if any,\nrecognized may vary based on the estimates and assumptions we use.\nEstimated Useful Lives of Long-Lived Assets\nWe assess the useful lives of the assets underlying our properties based upon a subjective determination of the period of future benefit for\neach asset. We record depreciation expense with respect to these assets based upon the estimated useful lives we determine. Our determinations of the useful lives of the assets could result in a materially different presentation of the financial\nstatements or materially different amounts being reported in the financial statements, as such determinations, and the corresponding amount of depreciation expense, may vary dramatically based on the estimates and assumptions we use.\nConsolidation of Investments in Joint Ventures\nWe will evaluate the consolidation of our investments in joint ventures in accordance with relevant accounting guidance. This evaluation\nrequires us to determine whether we have a controlling interest in a joint venture through a means other than voting rights, and, if so, such joint venture may be required to be consolidated in our financial statements. Our evaluation of our joint\nventures under such accounting guidance could result in a materially different presentation of the financial statements or materially different amounts being reported in the financial statements, as the joint venture entities included in our\nfinancial statements may vary based on the estimates and assumptions we use.\nREIT Qualification\nWe made an election under Section 856(c) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (the Code) to be taxed as a REIT under the Code, commencing\nwith the taxable year ended December 31, 2014. By qualifying as a REIT for federal income tax purposes, we generally will not be subject to federal income tax on income that we distribute to our stockholders. If we fail to qualify as a REIT in\nany taxable year, we will be subject to federal income tax on our taxable income at regular corporate rates and will not be permitted to qualify for treatment as a REIT for federal income tax purposes for four years following the year in which our\nqualification is denied. Such an event could materially and adversely affect our net income and could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations. However, we believe that we are organized and operate in a\nmanner that will enable us to continue to qualify for treatment as a REIT for federal income tax purposes, and we intend to continue to operate as to remain qualified as a REIT for federal income tax purposes.\nResults of Operations\nOverview\nWe derive revenues principally from: (i) rents received from tenants who rent storage units under\nmonth-to-month\nleases at each of our self storage facilities; and (ii) sales of packing- and storage-related supplies at our storage facilities. Therefore, our operating\nresults depend significantly on our ability to retain our existing tenants and lease our available self storage units to new tenants, while maintaining and, where possible, increasing the prices for our self storage units. Additionally, our\noperating results depend on our tenants making their required rental payments to us.\nCompetition in the market areas in which we operate\nis significant and affects the occupancy levels, rental rates, rental revenues and operating expenses of our facilities. Development of any new self storage facilities would intensify competition of self storage operators in markets in which we\noperate.\nAs of December 31, 2016, 2015, and 2014, we owned 77, 33, and five self storage facilities, respectively. Our operating\nresults for the year ended December 31, 2014 include results for partial year periods for five self storage facilities that we owned as of December 31, 2014. Our operating results for the year ended December 31, 2015 include full year\nperiods for those five self storage facilities plus partial year periods for the 28 self storage facilities we acquired during 2015.\n48\nTable of Contents\nOur operating results for the year ended December 31, 2016 included full year periods for the 33 properties owned as of December 31, 2015, plus partial year periods for the 44 self\nstorage facilities we acquired during 2016. As such, we believe there is little basis for comparison between the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015, and 2014. Operating results in future periods will depend on the results of operations of\nthese properties and of the real estate properties that we acquire in the future.\nComparison of the Years Ended December 31,\n2016 and 2015\nTotal Revenues\nTotal revenues for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015 were approximately $45.4 million and $17.9 million, respectively.\nThe increase in total revenue is primarily attributable to a full year of operations for 33 properties and a partial year of operations for 44 properties during the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to a full year of operations for five\nproperties and a partial year of operations of 28 properties during the year ended December 31, 2015. We expect total revenues to increase in future periods commensurate with our future acquisition activity.\nProperty Operating Expenses\nProperty operating expenses for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015 were approximately $16.0 million and $6.8 million,\nrespectively. Property operating expenses includes the cost to operate our facilities including payroll, utilities, insurance, real estate taxes, and marketing. The increase in property operating expenses is primarily attributable to a full year of\noperations for 33 properties and a partial year of operations for 44 properties during the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to a full year of operations for five properties and a partial year of operations of 28 properties during the year\nended December 31, 2015. We expect property operating expenses to increase in future periods commensurate with our future acquisition activity.\nProperty Operating Expenses \u0096 Affiliates\nProperty operating expenses \u0096 affiliates for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015 were approximately $5.7 million and\n$2.1 million, respectively. Property operating expenses \u0096 affiliates includes property management fees and asset management fees. The increase in property operating expenses \u0096 affiliates is primarily attributable to a full year of\noperations for 33 properties and a partial year of operations for 44 properties during the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to a full year of operations for five properties and a partial year of operations of 28 properties during the year\nended December 31, 2015. We expect property operating expenses \u0096 affiliates to increase in future periods commensurate with our future acquisition activity.\nGeneral and Administrative Expenses\nGeneral and administrative expenses for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015 were approximately $2.9 million and\n$1.6 million, respectively. General and administrative expenses consist primarily of legal expenses, transfer agent fees, directors\u0092 and officers\u0092 insurance expense, an allocation of a portion of our Advisor\u0092s payroll related\ncosts, accounting expenses and board of directors\u0092 related costs. The increase in general and administrative expenses is primarily attributable to increases in accounting, transfer agent, board of directors\u0092, and legal costs commensurate\nwith our increased operational activity. We expect general and administrative expenses to increase in the future as our operational activity increases, but decrease as a percentage of total revenues.\nDepreciation and Amortization Expenses\nDepreciation and amortization expenses for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015 were approximately $22.1 million and\n$9.1 million, respectively. Depreciation expense consists primarily of depreciation on the buildings and site improvements at our properties. Amortization expense consists of the amortization of intangible assets resulting from our\nacquisitions. The increase in depreciation and amortization expenses is primarily attributable to a full year of operations for 33 properties and a partial year of operations for 44 properties during the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to\na full year of operations for five properties and a partial year of operations of 28 properties during the year ended December 31, 2015. We expect depreciation and amortization expenses to increase in future periods commensurate with our future\nacquisition activity.\n49\nTable of Contents\nAcquisition Expenses \u0096 Affiliates\nAcquisition expenses \u0096 affiliates for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015 were approximately $10.7 million and\n$2.8 million, respectively. These acquisition expenses primarily relate to the costs associated with the 44 properties acquired during 2016 and 28 properties acquired during 2015. We expect acquisition expenses\u0097affiliates to fluctuate\ncommensurate with our acquisition activities.\nOther Property Acquisition Expenses\nOther property acquisition expenses for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015 were approximately $3.0 million and\n$0.6 million, respectively. These acquisition expenses primarily relate to the due diligence costs associated with the 44 properties acquired during 2016 and 28 properties acquired during 2015. We expect other property acquisition expenses to\nfluctuate commensurate with our acquisition activities.\nInterest Expense and Accretion of Fair Market Value of Secured Debt\nInterest expense and the accretion of fair market value of secured debt for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015 were approximately\n$7.1 million and $2.8 million, respectively. The increase is attributable to the debt obtained in conjunction with the 44 properties acquired during 2016 and 28 properties acquired during 2015. We expect interest expense and the accretion\nof fair market value of secured debt to increase in future periods commensurate with our future debt level.\nInterest Expense - Debt\nIssuance Costs\nInterest expense - debt issuance costs for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015 were approximately\n$3.8 million and $1.0 million, respectively. The increase in interest expense - debt issuance costs is attributable to the amortization of costs incurred in connection with obtaining financing for the acquisition of our self storage\nproperties and approximately $0.8 million of costs incurred related to the KeyBank CMBS Loan that were expensed in accordance with GAAP. We expect debt issuance costs to fluctuate commensurate with our future financing activity.\nSame-Store Facility Results\nThe following table sets forth operating data for our same-store facilities (those properties included in the consolidated results of\noperations since January 1, 2015) for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015.

On a same-store basis, for the same periods, parking\nrepresented approximately 43,000 square feet.\n(4)\nDetermined by dividing the sum of the\nmonth-end\noccupied square feet for the applicable group of facilities for each applicable period by the sum of their\nmonth-end\nrentable square feet for the period.\n(5)\nDetermined by dividing the aggregate realized rental revenue for each applicable period by the aggregate of the\nmonth-end\noccupied square feet for the period. Properties are\nincluded in the respective calculations in their first full month of operations, as appropriate. We have excluded the realized rental revenue and occupied square feet related to parking herein for the purpose of calculating annualized rent per\noccupied square foot.\nOur increase in same-store revenue of approximately $370,000 was primarily the result of increased\naverage physical occupancy of approximately 3% and increased rent per occupied square foot of approximately 8.1% for the year ended December 31, 2016 over the year ended December 31, 2015.\nOur same-store property operating expenses increased by approximately $120,000 for the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to the year\nended December 31, 2015 primarily due to increased payroll and property tax expenses.\nComparison of the Years Ended\nDecember 31, 2015 and 2014\nTotal Revenues\nTotal revenues for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014 were approximately $17.9 million and $0.5 million, respectively.\nThe increase in total revenues is primarily attributable to the acquisition of 28 self storage properties during 2015 and, to a lesser extent, a full year of operations from the five properties acquired during 2014. We expect total revenues to\nincrease in future periods.\nProperty Operating Expenses\nProperty operating expenses for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014 were approximately $6.8 million and $0.2 million,\nrespectively. Property operating expenses includes the cost to operate our facilities including payroll, utilities, insurance, real estate taxes, and marketing. The increase in property operating expenses is primarily attributable to the acquisition\nof 28 self storage properties during 2015 and, to a lesser extent, a full year of operations from the five properties acquired during 2014.\nProperty Operating Expenses \u0096 Affiliates\nProperty operating expenses \u0096 affiliates for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014 were approximately $2.1 million and\n$0.1 million, respectively. Property operating expenses \u0096 affiliates includes property management fees and asset management fees. The increase in property operating expenses \u0096 affiliates is primarily attributable to the acquisition of\n28 self storage properties during 2015 and, to a lesser extent, a full year of operations from the five properties acquired during 2014.\nGeneral and Administrative Expenses\nGeneral and administrative expenses for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014 were approximately $1.6 million and\n$0.9 million, respectively. General and administrative expenses consist primarily of legal expenses, transfer agent fees, directors\u0092 and officers\u0092 insurance expense, an allocation of a portion of our Advisor\u0092s payroll related\ncosts, accounting expenses and board of directors\u0092 related costs.\nDepreciation and Amortization Expenses\nDepreciation and amortization expenses for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014 were approximately $9.1 million and\n$0.3 million, respectively. Depreciation expense consists primarily of depreciation on the buildings and site improvements at our properties. Amortization expense consists of the amortization of intangible assets resulting from our\nacquisitions. The increase in depreciation and amortization expense is attributable to the acquisition of 28 self storage properties during 2015 and, to a lesser extent, a full year of operations from the five properties acquired during 2014.\n51\nTable of Contents\nAcquisition Expenses \u0096 Affiliates\nAcquisition expenses \u0096 affiliates for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014 were approximately $2.8 million and\n$1.1 million, respectively. These acquisition expenses relate to the costs associated with the 28 properties acquired during 2015 and the five properties acquired in the fourth quarter of 2014.\nOther Property Acquisition Expenses\nOther property acquisition expenses for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014 were approximately $0.6 million and\n$0.2 million, respectively. These other property acquisition expenses relate to the costs associated with the 28 properties acquired during 2015 and the five properties acquired in the fourth quarter of 2014.\nInterest Expense and Accretion of Fair Market Value of Secured Debt\nInterest expense and the accretion of fair market value of secured debt for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014 were approximately\n$2.8 million and $0.1 million, respectively. The increase is attributable to the interest incurred on the debt used to finance the acquisitions of 28 properties acquired during 2015 and the five properties acquired in the fourth quarter of\n2014.\nInterest Expense - Debt Issuance Costs\nDebt issuance costs for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014 were approximately $1.0 million and $4,000, respectively. The\nincrease in debt issuance costs is attributable to the costs incurred in connection with obtaining financing for the acquisition of the 28 self storage properties during 2015 and approximately $0.5 million of costs incurred related to the\nAmended KeyBank Credit Facility that were expensed in accordance with GAAP.\nNon-GAAP\nFinancial Measures\nFunds from Operations and Modified Funds from Operations\nDue to certain unique operating characteristics of real estate companies, the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts, or NAREIT,\nan industry trade group, has promulgated a measure known as funds from operations, or FFO, which we believe to be an appropriate supplemental measure to reflect the operating performance of a REIT. The use of FFO is recommended by the REIT industry\nas a supplemental performance measure. FFO is not equivalent to our net income (loss) as determined under GAAP.\nWe define FFO, a\nnon-GAAP\nmeasure, consistent with the standards established by the White Paper on FFO approved by the Board of Governors of NAREIT, as revised in February 2004, or the White Paper. The White Paper defines FFO\nas net income (loss) computed in accordance with GAAP, excluding gains or losses from sales of property and asset impairment write downs, plus depreciation and amortization, and after adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures.\nAdjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures are calculated to reflect FFO on the same basis. Our FFO calculation complies with NAREIT\u0092s policy described above.\nThe historical accounting convention used for real estate assets requires straight-line depreciation of buildings and improvements, which\nimplies that the value of real estate assets diminishes predictably over time. Diminution in value may occur if such assets are not adequately maintained or repaired and renovated as required by relevant circumstances or other measures necessary to\nmaintain the assets are not undertaken. However, we believe that, since real estate values historically rise and fall with market conditions, including inflation, interest rates, the business cycle, unemployment and consumer spending, presentations\nof operating results for a REIT using historical accounting for depreciation may be less informative. In addition, in the determination of FFO, we believe it is appropriate to disregard impairment charges, as this is a fair value adjustment that is\nlargely based on market fluctuations and assessments regarding general market conditions which can change over time. An asset will only be evaluated for impairment if certain impairment indications exist and if the carrying value, or book value,\nexceeds the total estimated undiscounted future cash flows (including net rental revenues, net proceeds on the sale of the property, and any other ancillary cash flows at a property or group level under GAAP) from such asset. Testing for impairment\nis a continuous process and is analyzed on a quarterly basis. Investors should note, however, that determinations of whether impairment charges have been incurred are based partly on anticipated operating performance, because estimated undiscounted\nfuture cash flows from a property, including estimated future net rental revenues, net proceeds on the sale of the property, and certain other ancillary cash flows, are taken into account in determining whether an impairment charge has been\nincurred. While impairment charges are excluded from the calculation of FFO as described above, investors are cautioned that due to the fact that impairments are based on estimated future undiscounted cash flows and that we intend to have a\nrelatively limited term of our operations; it could be difficult to recover any impairment charges through the eventual sale of the property. To date, we have not recognized any impairments.\n52\nTable of Contents\nHistorical accounting for real estate involves the use of GAAP. Any other method of accounting\nfor real estate such as the fair value method cannot be construed to be any more accurate or relevant than the comparable methodologies of real estate valuation found in GAAP. Nevertheless, we believe that the use of FFO, which excludes the impact\nof real estate related depreciation and amortization and impairments, assists in providing a more complete understanding of our performance to investors and to our management, and when compared year over year, reflects the impact on our operations\nfrom trends in occupancy rates, rental rates, operating costs, general and administrative expenses, and interest costs, which may not be immediately apparent from net income (loss).\nHowever, FFO or modified funds from operations (\u0093MFFO\u0094), discussed below, should not be construed to be more relevant or accurate\nthan the current GAAP methodology in calculating net income (loss) or in its applicability in evaluating our operating performance. The method utilized to evaluate the value and performance of real estate under GAAP should be considered a more\nrelevant measure of operational performance and is, therefore, given more prominence than the\nnon-GAAP\nFFO and MFFO measures and the adjustments to GAAP in calculating FFO and MFFO.\nChanges in the accounting and reporting rules under GAAP that were put into effect and other changes to GAAP accounting for real estate\nsubsequent to the establishment of NAREIT\u0092s definition of FFO have prompted an increase in cash-settled expenses, specifically acquisition fees and expenses, that are expensed as operating expenses under GAAP. We believe these fees and expenses\ndo not affect our overall long-term operating performance. Publicly registered,\nnon-traded\nREITs typically have a significant amount of acquisition activity and are substantially more dynamic during their\ninitial years of investment and operation. The purchase of properties, and the corresponding expenses associated with that process, is a key feature of our business plan in order to generate operational income and cash flow in order to make\ndistributions to investors. While other\nstart-up\nentities may also experience significant acquisition activity during their initial years, we believe that publicly registered,\nnon-traded\nREITs are unique in that they typically have a limited life with targeted exit strategies within a relatively limited time frame after the acquisition activity ceases. As disclosed in the prospectus\nfor our Offering, we will use the proceeds raised in our Offering to acquire properties, and we expect to begin the process of achieving a liquidity event (\ni.e.\n, listing of our shares of common stock on a national securities exchange, a\nmerger or sale, the sale of all or substantially all of our assets, or another similar transaction) within three to five years after the completion of our Offering, which is generally comparable to other publicly registered,\nnon-traded\nREITs. Thus, we do not intend to continuously purchase assets and intend to have a limited life. The decision whether to engage in any liquidity event is in the sole discretion of our board of directors.\nDue to the above factors and other unique features of publicly registered,\nnon-traded\nREITs, the Investment Program Association, or the IPA, an industry trade group, has standardized a measure known as MFFO,\nwhich the IPA has recommended as a supplemental measure for publicly registered,\nnon-traded\nREITs and which we believe to be another appropriate supplemental measure to reflect the operating performance of a\npublicly registered,\nnon-traded\nREIT having the characteristics described above. MFFO is not equivalent to our net income (loss) as determined under GAAP, and MFFO may not be a useful measure of the impact of\nlong-term operating performance on value if we do not ultimately engage in a liquidity event. We believe that, because MFFO excludes acquisition fees and expenses that affect our operations only in periods in which properties are acquired and that\nwe consider more reflective of investing activities, as well as other\nnon-operating\nitems included in FFO, MFFO can provide, on a going-forward basis, an indication of the sustainability (that is, the capacity\nto continue to be maintained) of our operating performance after the period in which we are acquiring our properties and once our portfolio is in place. By providing MFFO, we believe we are presenting useful information that assists investors and\nanalysts to better assess the sustainability of our operating performance after our Offering has been completed and our properties have been acquired. We also believe that MFFO is a recognized measure of sustainable operating performance by the\npublicly registered,\nnon-traded\nREIT industry. Further, we believe MFFO is useful in comparing the sustainability of our operating performance after our Offering and acquisitions are completed with the\nsustainability of the operating performance of other real estate companies that are not as involved in acquisition activities. Investors are cautioned that MFFO should only be used to assess the sustainability of our operating performance after our\nOffering has been completed and properties have been acquired, as it excludes acquisition fees and expenses that have a negative effect on our operating performance during the periods in which properties are acquired.\nWe define MFFO, a\nnon-GAAP\nmeasure, consistent with the IPA\u0092s Guideline\n2010-01,\nSupplemental Performance Measure for Publicly Registered,\nNon-Listed\nREITs: Modified Funds From Operations (the \u0093Practice Guideline\u0094) issued by the IPA in\nNovember 2010. The Practice Guideline defines MFFO as FFO further adjusted for the following items included in the determination of GAAP net income (loss): acquisition fees and expenses; amounts relating to straight line rents and amortization of\nabove or below intangible lease assets and liabilities; accretion of discounts and amortization of premiums on debt investments;\nnon-recurring\nimpairments of real estate related investments;\nmark-to-market\nadjustments included in net income;\nnon-recurring\ngains or losses included in net income from the extinguishment or sale\nof debt, hedges, foreign\n53\nTable of Contents\nexchange, derivatives or securities holdings where trading of such holdings is not a fundamental attribute of the business plan, unrealized gains or losses resulting from consolidation from, or\ndeconsolidation to, equity accounting, and after adjustments for consolidated and unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures, with such adjustments calculated to reflect MFFO on the same basis. The accretion of discounts and amortization of\npremiums on debt investments, unrealized gains and losses on hedges, foreign exchange, derivatives or securities holdings, unrealized gains and losses resulting from consolidations, as well as other listed cash flow adjustments are adjustments made\nto net income (loss) in calculating cash flows from operations and, in some cases, reflect gains or losses which are unrealized and may not ultimately be realized.\nOur MFFO calculation complies with the IPA\u0092s Practice Guideline described above. In calculating MFFO, we exclude acquisition related\nexpenses, the amortization of fair value adjustments related to debt, realized and unrealized gains and losses on foreign exchange holdings and the adjustments of such items related to noncontrolling interests. The other adjustments included in the\nIPA\u0092s Practice Guideline are not applicable to us for the periods presented. Acquisition fees and expenses are paid in cash by us, and we have not set aside or put into escrow any specific amount of proceeds from our Offering to be used to fund\nacquisition fees and expenses. We do not intend to fund acquisition fees and expenses in the future from operating revenues and cash flows, nor from the sale of properties and subsequent\nre-deployment\nof\ncapital and concurrent incurring of acquisition fees and expenses. Acquisition fees and expenses include payments to our Advisor and third parties. Acquisition related expenses under GAAP are considered operating expenses and as expenses included in\nthe determination of net income (loss) and income (loss) from continuing operations, both of which are performance measures under GAAP. All paid and accrued acquisition fees and expenses will have negative effects on returns to investors, the\npotential for future distributions, and cash flows generated by us, unless earnings from operations or net sales proceeds from the disposition of other properties are generated to cover the purchase price of the property, these fees and expenses and\nother costs related to such property. In the future, if we are not able to raise additional proceeds from our DRP Offering or other offerings, this could result in us paying acquisition fees or reimbursing acquisition expenses due to our Advisor, or\na portion thereof, with net proceeds from borrowed funds, operational earnings or cash flows, net proceeds from the sale of properties, or ancillary cash flows. As a result, the amount of proceeds available for investment and operations would be\nreduced, or we may incur additional interest expense as a result of borrowed funds.\nFurther, under GAAP, certain contemplated\nnon-cash\nfair value and other\nnon-cash\nadjustments are considered operating\nnon-cash\nadjustments to net income (loss) in determining\ncash flows from operations. In addition, we view fair value adjustments of derivatives and the amortization of fair value adjustments related to debt as items which are unrealized and may not ultimately be realized or as items which are not\nreflective of\non-going\noperations and are therefore typically adjusted for when assessing operating performance.\nWe use MFFO and the adjustments used to calculate it in order to evaluate our performance against other publicly registered,\nnon-traded\nREITs which intend to have limited lives with short and defined acquisition periods and targeted exit strategies shortly thereafter. As noted above, MFFO may not be a useful measure of the impact of\nlong-term operating performance if we do not continue to operate in this manner. We believe that our use of MFFO and the adjustments used to calculate it allow us to present our performance in a manner that reflects certain characteristics that are\nunique to publicly registered,\nnon-traded\nREITs, such as their limited life, limited and defined acquisition period and targeted exit strategy, and hence that the use of such measures may be useful to\ninvestors. For example, acquisition fees and expenses are intended to be funded from the proceeds of our Offering and other financing sources and not from operations. By excluding expensed acquisition fees and expenses, the use of MFFO provides\ninformation consistent with management\u0092s analysis of the operating performance of the properties. Additionally, fair value adjustments, which are based on the impact of current market fluctuations and underlying assessments of general market\nconditions, but can also result from operational factors such as rental and occupancy rates, may not be directly related or attributable to our current operating performance. By excluding such charges that may reflect anticipated and unrealized\ngains or losses, we believe MFFO provides useful supplemental information.\nPresentation of this information is intended to provide useful\ninformation to investors as they compare the operating performance of different REITs, although it should be noted that not all REITs calculate FFO and MFFO the same way, so comparisons with other REITs may not be meaningful. Furthermore, FFO and\nMFFO are not necessarily indicative of cash flow available to fund cash needs and should not be considered as an alternative to net income (loss) or income (loss) from continuing operations as an indication of our performance, as an alternative to\ncash flows from operations, which is an indication of our liquidity, or indicative of funds available to fund our cash needs including our ability to make distributions to our stockholders. FFO and MFFO should be reviewed in conjunction with other\nmeasurements as an indication of our performance. MFFO may be useful in assisting management and investors in assessing the sustainability of operating performance in future operating periods, and in particular, after the offering and acquisition\nstages are complete.\nNeither the SEC, NAREIT, nor any other regulatory body has passed judgment on the acceptability of the adjustments\nthat we use to calculate FFO or MFFO. In the future, the SEC, NAREIT or another regulatory body may decide to\n54\nTable of Contents\nstandardize the allowable adjustments across the publicly registered,\nnon-traded\nREIT industry and we would have to adjust our calculation and\ncharacterization of FFO or MFFO. The following is a reconciliation of net income (loss), which is the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure, to FFO and MFFO for each of the periods presented below.\nYear Ended\nDecember 31,\n2016\nYear Ended\nDecember 31,\n2015\nYear Ended\nDecember 31,\n2014\nNet loss attributable to Strategic Storage Trust II, Inc. common stockholders\n(1)\n$(26,090,385\n)\n$(15,290,941\n)\n$(2,396,385\n)\nAdd.\nDepreciation\n11,132,336\n3,939,676\n93,433\nAmortization of intangible assets\n10,864,617\n5,142,417\n158,617\nDeduct.\nAdjustment for noncontrolling interests\n(10,818\n)\n(45,976\n)\n(3,414\n)\nFFO\n(4,104,250\n)\n(6,254,824\n)\n(2,147,749\n)\nOther Adjustments.\nAcquisition expenses\n(2)\n13,702,058\n3,401,321\n1,288,690\nAccretion of fair market value of secured\ndebt\n(3)\n(386,848\n)\n(91,061\n)\n(16,543\n)\nAdjustment for noncontrolling interests\n(7,145\n)\n(26,775\n)\n(7,007\n)\nMFFO\n$9,203,815\n$(2,971,339\n)\n$(882,609\n)\nAs discussed above, our results of operations for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015, and 2014 have\nbeen significantly impacted by our acquisitions during each year. The information below should be read in conjunction with the discussion regarding the acquisitions above.\n(1)\nNet loss attributable to Strategic Storage Trust II, Inc. common stockholders for the years ended December 31, 2015, and 2014 included approximately $4.8 million, and $0.1 million, respectively, in\ndistributions to Preferred Unitholders in our Operating Partnership and approximately $1.6 million and $28,000, respectively, in accretion of preferred equity costs. As of December 31, 2015, we had redeemed all of the Preferred Units.\n(2)\nIn evaluating investments in real estate, we differentiate the costs to acquire the investment from the operations derived from the investment. Such information would be comparable only for publicly registered,\nnon-traded\nREITs that have generally completed their acquisition activity and have other similar operating characteristics. By excluding expensed acquisition related expenses, we believe MFFO provides useful\nsupplemental information that is comparable for each type of real estate investment and is consistent with management\u0092s analysis of the investing and operating performance of our properties. Acquisition fees and expenses include payments\nto our Advisor and third parties. Acquisition related expenses under GAAP are considered operating expenses and as expenses included in the determination of net income (loss) and income (loss) from continuing operations, both of which are\nperformance measures under GAAP. All paid and accrued acquisition fees and expenses will have negative effects on returns to investors, the potential for future distributions, and cash flows generated by us, unless earnings from operations or net\nsales proceeds from the disposition of other properties are generated to cover the purchase price of the property, these fees and expenses and other costs related to such property.\n(3)\nThis represents the difference between the stated interest rate and the estimated market interest rate on assumed notes as of the date of acquisition. Such amounts have been excluded from MFFO because we believe MFFO\nprovides useful supplementary information by focusing on operating fundamentals, rather than events not related to our normal operations. We are responsible for managing interest rate risk and do not rely on another party to manage such risk.\nNon-cash\nItems Included in Net Loss.\nProvided below is additional information related to selected\nnon-cash\nitems included in net loss above,\nwhich may be helpful in assessing our operating results.\n\u0095\nDebt issuance costs of approximately $3.8 million, $1.0 million, and $4,000 respectively, were recognized for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015, and 2014.\n55\nTable of Contents\nCash Flows\nA comparison of cash flows for operating, investing and financing activities for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015 are as\nfollows.\nYear Ended\nDecember 31, 2016\nYear Ended\nDecember 31, 2015\nChange\nNet cash flow provided by (used in).\nOperating activities\n$(1,587,221\n)\n$(1,252,240\n)\n$(334,981\n)\nInvesting activities\n(510,295,408\n)\n(140,865,350\n)\n(369,430,058\n)\nFinancing activities\n498,943,670\n163,690,908\n335,252,762\nCash flows used in operating activities for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015 were approximately\n$1.6 million and $1.3 million, respectively, a change of approximately $0.3 million. The change in cash used in our operating activities is primarily the result of an increase in net loss, excluding depreciation, amortization, and\naccretion of approximately $2.0 million (primarily the result of increased acquisition expense of approximately $10.3 million), offset by a change in working capital of approximately $1.6 million.\nCash flows used in investing activities for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015 were approximately $510 million and\n$141 million, respectively, an increase in the use of cash of approximately $369 million. The change in cash used in investing activities primarily relates to cash consideration paid of approximately $500 million for our acquisitions\nduring the year ended December 31, 2016, compared to $136 million for the purchase of our acquisitions during the year ended December 31, 2015.\nCash flows provided by financing activities for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015 were approximately $499 million and\n$164 million, respectively, an increase in the cash provided of approximately $335 million. The change in cash provided by financing activities was comprised of approximately $128 million more in net proceeds from the issuance of\ncommon stock, approximately $207 million more in net proceeds from the issuance of debt.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nShort-Term Liquidity and Capital Resources\nWe generally expect that we will meet our short-term operating liquidity requirements from the combination of proceeds of our Offering,\nproceeds from secured or unsecured financing from banks or other lenders, net cash provided by property operations and advances from our Advisor which will be repaid, without interest, as funds are available after meeting our current liquidity\nrequirements, subject to the limitations on reimbursement set forth in our Advisory Agreement with our Advisor. Per the Advisory Agreement, all advances from our Advisor shall be reimbursed no less frequently than monthly, although our\nAdvisor has indicated that it may waive such a requirement on a\nmonth-by-month\nbasis.\nDistribution Policy and Distributions\nOn December 20, 2016, our board of directors declared a distribution rate for the first quarter of 2017 of $0.00164383561 per day per\nshare on the outstanding shares of common stock payable to both Class A and Class T stockholders of record of such shares as shown on our books at the close of business on each day during the period, commencing on January 1, 2017 and\ncontinuing on each day thereafter through and including March 31, 2017. Such distributions payable to each stockholder of record during a month will be paid the following month.\nCurrently, we are making distributions to our stockholders using proceeds of the Offering in anticipation of future cash flow. As such, this\nreduces the amount of capital we will ultimately invest in properties. Because substantially all of our operations will be performed indirectly through our Operating Partnership, our ability to pay distributions depends in large part on our\nOperating Partnership\u0092s ability to pay distributions to its partners, including to us. In the event we do not have enough cash from operations to fund cash distributions, we may borrow, issue additional securities or sell assets in order to\nfund the distributions. Though we presently intend to pay only cash distributions, and potentially stock distributions, we are authorized by our charter to pay\nin-kind\ndistributions of readily marketable\nsecurities, distributions of beneficial interests in a liquidating trust established for our dissolution and the liquidation of our assets in accordance with the terms of the charter or distributions that meet all of the following conditions.\n(a) our board of directors advises each stockholder of the risks associated with direct ownership of the property; (b) our board of directors offers each stockholder the election of receiving such\nin-kind\ndistributions; and\n(c) in-kind\ndistributions are only made to those stockholders who accept such offer.\n56\nTable of Contents\nFor some period after our Offering, we may not be able to pay distributions from our cash flows\nfrom operations, in which case distributions may be paid in part from debt financing.\nOver the long-term, we expect that a greater\npercentage of our distributions will be paid from cash flows from operations. However, our operating performance cannot be accurately predicted and may deteriorate in the future due to numerous factors, including our ability to raise and invest\ncapital at favorable yields, the financial performance of our investments in the current real estate and financial environment and the types and mix of investments in our portfolio. As a result, future distributions declared and paid may exceed cash\nflow from operations.\nDistributions are paid to our stockholders based on the record date selected by our board of directors. We\ncurrently declare and pay distributions monthly based on daily declaration and record dates so that investors may be entitled to distributions immediately upon purchasing our shares. We expect to continue to regularly pay distributions unless our\nresults of operations, our general financial condition, general economic conditions, or other factors inhibit us from doing so. Distributions will be authorized at the discretion of our board of directors, which will be directed, in substantial\npart, by its obligation to cause us to comply with the REIT requirements of the Code. Our board of directors may increase, decrease or eliminate the distribution rate that is being paid at any time. Distributions will be made on all classes of our\ncommon stock at the same time. The per share amount of distributions on Class A Shares and Class T Shares will likely differ because of different allocations of class-specific expenses. Specifically, distributions on Class T Shares\nwill likely be lower than distributions on Class A Shares because Class T Shares are subject to ongoing stockholder servicing fees. The funds we receive from operations that are available for distribution may be affected by a number of\nfactors, including the following.\n\u0095\nthe amount of time required for us to invest the funds received in the Offering;\n\u0095\nour operating and interest expenses;\n\u0095\nthe amount of distributions or dividends received by us from our indirect real estate investments;\n\u0095\nour ability to keep our properties occupied;\n\u0095\nour ability to maintain or increase rental rates;\n\u0095\nconstruction defects or capital improvements;\n\u0095\ncapital expenditures and reserves for such expenditures;\n\u0095\nthe issuance of additional shares; and\n\u0095\nfinancings and refinancings.\nThe following shows our distributions and the sources of such\ndistributions for the respective periods presented.\nYear Ended\nDecember 31, 2016\nYear Ended\nDecember 31, 2015\nDistributions paid in cash \u0096 common stockholders\n$11,358,337\n$1,497,802\nDistributions paid in cash \u0096 Operating Partnership unitholders\n12,003\n12,001\nDistributions paid in cash \u0096 preferred unitholders\n\u0097\n4,909,305\nDistributions reinvested\n10,791,747\n1,177,289\nTotal distributions\n$22,162,087\n$7,596,397\nSource of distributions\nCash flows provided by operations\n$\u0097\n\u0097\n$\u0097\n\u0097\nOffering proceeds from Primary Offering\n11,370,340\n51%\n6,419,108\n85%\nOffering proceeds from distribution reinvestment plan\n10,791,747\n49%\n1,177,289\n15%\nTotal sources\n$22,162,087\n100%\n$7,596,397\n100%\nFrom our inception through December 31, 2016, we paid cumulative distributions of approximately\n$30.0 million, as compared to cumulative negative FFO of approximately $12.5 million. For the year ended December 31, 2016, we paid\n57\nTable of Contents\ndistributions of approximately $22.2 million, as compared to a negative FFO of approximately $4.1 million which reflects acquisition related expenses of approximately\n$13.7 million. For the year ended December 31, 2015, we paid distributions of approximately $7.6 million, as compared to a negative FFO of approximately $6.3 million which reflects acquisition related expenses of approximately\n$3.4 million. The payment of distributions from sources other than FFO may reduce the amount of proceeds available for investment and operations or cause us to incur additional interest expense as a result of borrowed funds.\nWe must distribute to our stockholders at least 90% of our taxable income each year in order to meet the requirements for being treated as a\nREIT under the Code. Our directors may authorize distributions in excess of this percentage as they deem appropriate. Because we may receive income from interest or rents at various times during our fiscal year, distributions may not reflect our\nincome earned in that particular distribution period, but may be made in anticipation of cash flow that we expect to receive during a later period and may be made in advance of actual receipt of funds in an attempt to make distributions relatively\nuniform. To allow for such differences in timing between the receipt of income and the payment of expenses, and the effect of required debt payments, among other things, we could be required to borrow funds from third parties on a short-term basis,\nissue new securities, or sell assets to meet the distribution requirements that are necessary to achieve the tax benefits associated with qualifying as a REIT. We are not prohibited from undertaking such activities by our charter, bylaws or\ninvestment policies, and we may use an unlimited amount from any source to pay our distributions. These methods of obtaining funding could affect future distributions by increasing operating costs and decreasing available cash, which could reduce\nthe value of our stockholders\u0092 investment in our shares. In addition, such distributions may constitute a return of investors\u0092 capital.\nWe have not been able to and may not be able to pay distributions from our cash flows from operations, in which case distributions may be paid\nin part from debt financing or from proceeds from the issuance of common stock in our Primary Offering and pursuant to our distribution reinvestment plan. The payment of distributions from sources other than cash flows from operations may reduce the\namount of proceeds available for investment and operations or cause us to incur additional interest expense as a result of borrowed funds.\nOver the long-term, we expect that a greater percentage of our distributions will be paid from cash flows from operations. However, our\noperating performance cannot be accurately predicted and may deteriorate in the future due to numerous factors, including our ability to raise and invest capital at favorable yields, the financial performance of our investments in the current real\nestate and financial environment and the types and mix of investments in our portfolio. As a result, future distributions declared and paid may exceed cash flow from operations.\nIndebtedness\nAs\nof December 31, 2016, our total indebtedness was approximately $320.8 million, which included approximately $184.3 million in fixed rate debt, $137.0 million in variable rate debt and approximately $2.1 million in debt\npremium less approximately $2.6 million in debt issuance costs.\nLong-Term Liquidity and Capital Resources\nOn a long-term basis, our principal demands for funds will be for property acquisitions, either directly or through entity interests, for the\npayment of operating expenses and distributions, and for the payment of interest on our outstanding indebtedness, if any.\nLong-term\npotential future sources of capital include proceeds from secured or unsecured financings from banks or other lenders, issuance of equity instruments, undistributed funds from operations, and additional public or private offerings. To the extent we\nare not able to secure requisite financing in the form of a credit facility or other debt, we will be dependent upon proceeds from the issuance of equity securities and cash flows from operating activities in order to meet our long-term liquidity\nrequirements and to fund our distributions.\n58\nTable of Contents\nContractual Obligations\nThe following table summarizes our contractual obligations as of December 31, 2016.\nPayments due during the years ending December 31.\nTotal\n2017\n2018-2019\n2020-2021\nThereafter\nDebt interest\n(1)\n$68,776,563\n$10,544,304\n$17,304,143\n$15,786,780\n$25,141,336\nDebt principal\n(2)\n321,356,435\n110,873,322\n26,296,992\n14,828,279\n169,357,842\nTotal contractual obligations\n$390,132,998\n$121,417,626\n$43,601,135\n$30,615,059\n$194,499,178\n(1)\nInterest expense for fixed rate debt was calculated based upon the contractual rate and the interest expense on variable rate debt was calculated based on the rate in effect on December 31, 2016.

PBF Energy is the sole managing member of, and owner of an equity interest representing approximately\n96.5%\nof the outstanding economic interests in, PBF LLC as of\nDecember 31, 2016\n. PBF Energy operates and controls all of the business and affairs and consolidates the financial results of PBF LLC and its subsidiaries. PBF LLC is a holding company for the companies that directly and indirectly own and operate the business.\nUnless the context indicates otherwise, the terms \u201cwe,\u201d \u201cus,\u201d and \u201cour\u201d refer to PBF Energy and its consolidated subsidiaries, including PBF LLC, PBF Holding and its subsidiaries and PBFX and its subsidiaries.\n60\nExecutive Summary\nOur business operations are conducted by PBF LLC and its subsidiaries. We were formed in March 2008 to pursue the acquisitions of crude oil refineries and downstream assets in North America. We currently own and operate five domestic oil refineries and related assets located in Toledo, Ohio, Delaware City, Delaware, Paulsboro, New Jersey, New Orleans, Louisiana and Torrance, California. Our refineries have a combined processing capacity, known as throughput, of approximately 900,000 bpd, and a weighted average Nelson Complexity Index of 12.2. We operate in two reportable business segments: Refining and Logistics. Our five oil refineries are all engaged in the refining of crude oil and other feedstocks into petroleum products, and are aggregated into the Refining segment. PBFX operates certain logistical assets such as crude oil and refined petroleum products terminals, pipelines, and storage facilities, which are aggregated into the Logistics segment.\nFactors Affecting Comparability\nOur results over the past three years have been affected by the following events, the understanding of which will aid in assessing the comparability of our period to period financial performance and financial condition.\nTorrance Acquisition\nOn July 1, 2016, we acquired from ExxonMobil and its subsidiary, Mobil Pacific Pipeline Company (together, the \u201cTorrance Sellers\u201d), the Torrance refinery and related logistics assets. The Torrance refinery, located on 750 acres in Torrance, California, is a high-conversion 155,000 barrel per day, delayed-coking refinery with a Nelson Complexity of 14.9. The facility is strategically positioned in Southern California with advantaged logistics connectivity that offers flexible raw material sourcing and product distribution opportunities primarily in the California, Las Vegas and Phoenix area markets. The Torrance Acquisition increased our total throughput capacity to approximately 900,000 bpd.\nIn addition to refining assets, the Torrance Acquisition included a number of high-quality logistics assets consisting of a sophisticated network of crude and products pipelines, product distribution terminals and refinery crude and product storage facilities. The most significant of the logistics assets is a 189-mile crude gathering and transportation system which delivers San Joaquin Valley crude oil directly from the field to the refinery. Additionally, included in the transaction were several pipelines which provide access to sources of crude oil including the Ports of Long Beach and Los Angeles, as well as clean product outlets with a direct pipeline supplying jet fuel to the Los Angeles airport. The Torrance refinery also has crude and product storage facilities with approximately 8.6 million barrels of shell capacity.\nThe purchase price for the assets was approximately $521.4 million in cash after post-closing purchase price adjustments, plus final working capital of $450.6 million. The purchase price and fair value allocation may be subject to adjustment pending completion of the final valuation which was in process as of December 31, 2016. In addition, we assumed certain pre-existing environmental and regulatory emission credit obligations in connection with the Torrance Acquisition. The transaction was financed through a combination of cash on hand, including proceeds from our October 2015 Equity Offering and the 2023 Senior Secured Notes Offering, and borrowings under our Revolving Loan.\nTVPC Contribution Agreement\nOn August 31, 2016, PBFX entered into the TVPC Contribution Agreement between PBFX and PBF LLC. Pursuant to the TVPC Contribution Agreement, PBFX acquired from PBF LLC 50% of the issued and outstanding limited liability company interests of TVPC, whose assets consist of the 189-mile San Joaquin Valley Pipeline system, including the M55, M1 and M70 pipeline systems, including 11 pipeline stations with storage capacity and truck unloading capability at two of the stations (collectively, the \u201cTorrance Valley Pipeline\u201d). The total consideration paid to PBF LLC was $175.0 million, which was funded by PBFX with $20.0 million of cash on hand, $76.2 million in proceeds from the sale of marketable securities, and $78.8 million in net proceeds from the PBFX August 2016 Equity Offering. PBFX borrowed an additional $76.2 million under the PBFX Revolving Credit Facility, which was used to repay $76.2 million of the PBFX Term Loan in order to release $76.2 million in marketable securities that had collateralized the PBFXTerm Loan.\nPBFX Operating Company LP (\"PBFX Op Co\"), PBFX\u2019s wholly-owned subsidiary, serves as TVPC's managing member. PBFX, through its ownership of PBFX Op Co, has the sole ability to direct the activities of TVPC that most significantly impact its economic performance. PBFX is also considered to be the primary beneficiary for accounting purposes, and as a result fully consolidates the net assets and results of operations of TVPC with the 50% of TVPC it does not own recorded as noncontrolling interests and net income attributable to noncontrolling interests. The TVPC noncontrolling interest at PBFX eliminates in consolidation at the PBF Energy level.\n61\nPBFX Plains Asset Purchase\nOn April 29, 2016, PBFX's wholly-owed subsidiary, PBF Logistics Products Terminals LLC, completed the purchase of the East Coast Terminals from an affiliate of Plains All American Pipeline, L.P. The East Coast Terminals include a total of 57 product tanks with a total shell capacity of approximately 4.2 million barrels, pipeline connections to the Colonial Pipeline Company, Buckeye Partners, Sunoco Logistics Partners and other proprietary pipeline systems, 26 truck loading lanes and marine facilities capable of handling barges and ships.With the Plains Asset Purchase, PBFX increased its total shell capacity to over 8.1 million barrels. This acquisition expands PBFX's storage and terminaling footprint and introduces third-party customers to its revenue base.\nThe total cash consideration for the Plains Asset Purchase was approximately $100.0 million, less working capital adjustments. The transaction was financed by PBFX with $98.3 million in proceeds from the sale of marketable securities. PBFX borrowed an additional $98.5 million under the PBFX Revolving Credit Facility, which were used to repay $98.3 million of the PBFX Term Loan in order to release $98.3 million in marketable securities that had collateralized the PBFX Term Loan. The final purchase price and fair value allocation were completed as of December 31, 2016.\nPBF Energy Inc. Public Offerings\nAs a result of the initial public offering and related reorganization transactions, PBF Energy became the sole managing member of PBF LLC with a controlling voting interest in PBF LLC and its subsidiaries. Effective with completion of the initial public offering, PBF Energy consolidates the financial results of PBF LLC and its subsidiaries and records a noncontrolling interest in its consolidated financial statements representing the economic interests of noncontrolling PBF LLC unit holders.\nAdditionally, a series of secondary offerings were made in 2013, 2014 and 2015 whereby funds affiliated with Blackstone and First Reserve sold their interests in us. On June 12, 2013, Blackstone and First Reserve completed an exchange of 15,950,000 PBF LLC Series A units for the same number of shares of PBF Energy Class A common stock which were sold in a secondary public offering (the \"2013 secondary offering\"). On January 10, 2014, March 26, 2014 and June 17, 2014, funds affiliated with Blackstone and First Reserve exchanged 15,000,000, 15,000,000 and 18,000,000 PBF LLC Series A units, respectively, for the same number of shares of PBF Energy Class A common stock that were subsequently sold in secondary public offerings (the \u201c2014 secondary offerings\u201d). On February 6, 2015, funds affiliated with Blackstone and First Reserve exchanged 3,804,653 PBF LLC Series A units for the same number of shares of PBF Energy Class A common stock which were subsequently sold in a secondary public offering (the \u201cFebruary 2015 secondary offering\u201d and collectively with the 2013 secondary offering and the 2014 secondary offerings, the \"secondary offerings\"). As a result of these secondary offerings, Blackstone and First Reserve no longer hold any PBF LLC Series A units. The holders of PBF LLC Series B Units, which include certain current and former executive officers of PBF Energy, received a portion of the proceeds of the sales of the shares of PBF Energy Class A common stock by Blackstone and First Reserve in accordance with the amended and restated limited liability company agreement of PBF LLC. PBF Energy did not receive any proceeds from the secondary offerings.\nOn October 13, 2015, we completed the October 2015 Equity Offering of an aggregate of 11,500,000 shares of Class A common stock, including 1,500,000 shares of Class A common stock that was sold pursuant to the exercise of an over-allotment option, for net proceeds of\n$344.0\nmillion, after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and other offering expenses.\nOn December 19, 2016, we completed the December 2016 Equity Offering of an aggregate of 10,000,000 shares of Class A common stock for net proceeds of\n$274.3\nmillion, after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and other estimated offering expenses.\nAs of\nDecember 31, 2016\n, including the offerings described above, we now own\n109,204,047\nPBF LLC Series C Units and our current and former executive officers and directors and certain employees and others beneficially own\n3,920,902\nPBF LLC Series A Units, and the holders of our issued and outstanding shares of Class A common stock have\n96.5%\nof the voting power in us and the members of PBF LLC other than PBF Energy through their holdings of Class B common stock have the remaining\n3.5%\nof the voting power in us.\n2016 PBFX Equity Offerings\nOn April 5, 2016, PBFX completed a public offering of an aggregate of 2,875,000 common units, including 375,000 common units that were sold pursuant to the full exercise by the underwriter of its option to purchase additional common units, for net proceeds of $51.6 million, after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and other offering expenses . In addition, on August 17, 2016, PBFX completed a public offering of an aggregate of 4,000,000 common units,\n62\nand granted the underwriter an option to purchase an additional 600,000 common units, of which 375,000 units were subsequently purchased on September 14, 2016, for total net proceeds of $86.8 million, after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and other offering expenses. As a result of the 2016 PBFX Equity Offerings, as of\nDecember 31, 2016\n, PBF LLC holds a\n44.2%\nlimited partner interest in PBFX and owns all of PBFX's IDRs, with the remaining\n55.8%\nlimited partner interest owned by public common unit holders.\nChalmette Acquisition\nOn November 1, 2015, we acquired from ExxonMobil Oil Corporation, Mobil Pipe Line Company and PDV Chalmette, Inc., 100% of the ownership interests of Chalmette Refining, which owns the Chalmette refinery and related logistics assets. The Chalmette refinery, located outside of New Orleans, Louisiana, is a dual-train coking refinery and is capable of processing both light and heavy crude oil. Subsequent to the closing of the Chalmette Acquisition, Chalmette Refining is a wholly-owned subsidiary of PBF Holding.\nChalmette Refining owns 100% of the MOEM Pipeline, providing access to the Empire Terminal, as well as the CAM Connection Pipeline, providing access to the Louisiana Offshore Oil Port facility through a third party pipeline. Chalmette Refining also owns 80% of each of the Collins Pipeline Company and T&M Terminal Company, both located in Collins, Mississippi, which provide a clean products outlet for the refinery to the Plantation and Colonial Pipelines. Also included in the acquisition are a marine terminal capable of importing waterborne feedstocks and loading or unloading finished products; a clean products truck rack which provides access to local markets; and a crude and product storage facility.\nThe aggregate purchase price for the Chalmette Acquisition was $322.0 million in cash, plus inventory and working capital of $246.0 million, which was finalized in the first quarter of 2016. The transaction was financed through a combination of cash on hand and borrowings under our Revolving loan.\nPBFX Assets and Drop-Down Transactions\nPBFX\u2019s assets consist of the DCR Rail Terminal, the Toledo Truck Terminal, the DCR West Rack, the Toledo Storage Facility, the Delaware City Products Pipeline and Truck Rack, the East Coast Terminals and the Torrance Valley Pipeline. Apart from the East Coast Terminals, PBFX\u2019s revenue is derived from long-term, fee-based commercial agreements with subsidiaries of PBF Energy, which include minimum volume commitments, for receiving, handling, transferring and storing crude oil and refined products. These transactions are eliminated by PBF Energy in consolidation.\nDuring 2014, PBFX acquired from PBF LLC the DCR West Rack, a heavy crude oil rail unloading facility (also, capable of unloading light crude oil) at the Delaware City refinery and the Toledo Storage Facility, a tank farm and related facilities located at our Toledo refinery, including a propane storage and loading facility.\nOn May 14, 2015, PBFX acquired from PBF LLC all of the issued and outstanding limited liability company interests of Delaware Pipeline Company LLC and Delaware City Logistics Company LLC, whose assets consist of the Delaware City Products Pipeline and Truck Rack.\nOn August 31, 2016, PBFX acquired from PBF LLC 50% of the issued and outstanding limited liability company interests of TVPC, whose assets consist of the Torrance Valley Pipeline.\nAmended and Restated Asset Based Revolving Credit Facility\nOn an ongoing basis, the Revolving Loan is available to be used for working capital and other general corporate purposes. On August 15, 2014, the agreement was amended and restated to, among other things, increase the maximum availability to $2.50 billion and extend its maturity to August 2019. The amended and restated Revolving Loan includes an accordion feature which allows for aggregate commitments of up to\n$2.75 billion\n. In November and December 2015, PBF Holding increased the maximum availability under the Revolving Loan to\n$2.60 billion\nand\n$2.64 billion\n, respectively, in accordance with its accordion feature. The commitment fees on the unused portions, the interest rate on advances and the fees for letters of credit have also been reduced in the amended and restated Revolving Loan.\nAs noted in \"Note 4 - Acquisitions\", we drew down under our Revolving Loan to partially fund the Torrance Acquisition and\n$350.0 million\nremains outstanding as of\nDecember 31, 2016.\nSenior Secured Notes Offerings\nOn November 24, 2015, PBF Holding and PBF Finance Corporation issued\n$500.0 million\nin aggregate principal amount of the 2023 Senior Secured Notes. The net proceeds were approximately\n$490.0 million\nafter deducting the initial\n63\npurchasers\u2019 discount and offering expenses. We used the proceeds for general corporate purposes, including to fund a portion of the purchase price for the Torrance Acquisition.\nPBF Rail Revolving Credit Facility\nEffective March 25, 2014, PBF Rail Logistics Company LLC (\u201cPBF Rail\u201d), an indirect wholly-owned subsidiary of PBF Holding, entered into a\n$250.0\nmillion secured revolving credit agreement (the \u201cRail Facility\u201d). The primary purpose of the Rail Facility was to fund the acquisition by PBF Rail of coiled and insulated crude tank cars and non-coiled and non-insulated general purpose crude tank cars before December 2015.\nAs noted in \"Note 10 - Credit Facility and Long-term Debt\" to the consolidated financial statements, the Rail Facility was amended on two occasions in 2015 and 2016 and on December 22, 2016, the Rail Facility was terminated and replaced with the PBF Rail Term Loan (as described below).\nPBF Rail Term Loan\nOn December 22, 2016, PBF Rail entered into a\n$35.0 million\nterm loan (the \u201cPBF Rail Term Loan\u201d) with DVB Bank SE (\u201cDVB\u201d). The PBF Rail Term Loan amortizes monthly over its five year term and bears interest at the one month LIBOR plus 2.0%. As security for the PBF Rail Term Loan, PBF Rail pledged, among other things: (i) certain eligible railcars; (ii) the Debt Service Reserve Account; and (iii) PBF Holding's member interest in PBF Rail. Additionally, the PBF Rail Term Loan contains customary terms, events of default and covenants for transactions of this nature. PBF Rail may at any time repay the PBF Rail Term Loan without penalty in the event that railcars collateralizing the loan are sold, scrapped or otherwise removed from the collateral pool.\nPBFX Debt and Credit Facilities\nOn May 14, 2014, in connection with the closing of the PBFX Offering, PBFX entered into the five-year,\n$275.0 million\nPBFX Revolving Credit Facility and the three-year,\n$300.0 million\nPBFX Term Loan. The PBFX Revolving Credit Facility was increased from\n$275.0 million\nto\n$325.0 million\nin December 2014 and from\n$325.0 million\nto\n$360.0 million\nin May 2016. The PBFX Revolving Credit Facility is available to fund working capital, acquisitions, distributions and capital expenditures and for other general partnership purposes and is guaranteed by a guaranty of collection from PBF LLC. PBFX also has the ability to increase the maximum amount of the PBFX Revolving Credit Facility by an aggregate amount of up to\n$240.0 million\n, to a total facility size of\n$600.0 million\n, subject to receiving increased commitments from lenders or other financial institutions and satisfaction of certain conditions. The PBFX Revolving Credit Facility includes a\n$25.0 million\nsublimit for standby letters of credit and a\n$25.0 million\nsublimit for swingline loans. The PBFX Term Loan was used to fund distributions to PBF LLC and is guaranteed by a guaranty of collection from PBF LLC and secured at all times by cash, U.S. Treasury or other investment grade securities in an amount equal to or greater than the outstanding principal amount of the PBFX Term Loan.\nCertain subsequent acquisitions made by PBFX were funded partially by proceeds from the sale of marketable securities. PBFX used borrowings under the PBFX Revolving Credit Facility to repay a portion of the outstanding PBFX Term Loan, and thereby release a portion of the marketable securities that had collateralized the PBFX Term Loan.\nOn May 12, 2015, PBFX entered into an indenture among the Partnership, PBF Logistics Finance Corporation, a Delaware corporation and wholly-owned subsidiary of PBFX (\"PBF Logistics Finance,\" and together with PBFX, the \"Issuers\"), the Guarantors named therein (certain subsidiaries of PBFX) and Deutsche Bank Trust Company Americas, as Trustee, under which the Issuers issued\n$350.0\nmillion in aggregate principal amount of the PBFX Senior Notes. PBF LLC has provided a limited guarantee of collection of the principal amount of the PBFX Senior Notes, but is not otherwise subject to the covenants of the indenture. Of the\n$350.0\nmillion aggregate PBFX Senior Notes,\n$19.9\nmillion were purchased by certain of PBF Energy\u2019s officers and directors and their affiliates pursuant to a separate private placement transaction. After deducting offering expenses, PBFX received net proceeds of approximately\n$343.0\nmillion from the PBFX Senior Notes offering.\nJ. Aron Intermediation Agreements\nOn May 29, 2015, PBF Holding entered into amended and restated inventory intermediation agreements with J. Aron pursuant to which certain terms of the existing inventory intermediation agreements were amended, including, among other things, pricing and an extension of the term for a period of two years from the original expiry date of July 1, 2015, subject to certain early termination rights. In addition, the A&R Intermediation Agreements include one-year renewal clauses by mutual consent of both parties. The A&R Intermediation Agreements have not been renewed and are scheduled\n64\nto expire on July 1, 2017. If we are unable to negotiate an extension with J. Aron or enter into an alternative intermediation agreement, we will have to repurchase the inventories outstanding under the A&R Intermediation Agreement at that time.\nPursuant to each A&R Intermediation Agreement, J. Aron continues to purchase and hold title to certain of the intermediate and finished products produced by the Paulsboro and Delaware City refineries, respectively, and delivered into tanks at the Refineries. Furthermore, J. Aron agrees to sell the Products back to Paulsboro refinery and Delaware City refinery as the Products are discharged out of the refineries' tanks. J. Aron has the right to store the products purchased in tanks under the A&R Intermediation Agreements and will retain these storage rights for the term of the agreements. PBF Holding continues to market and sell the products independently to third parties.\nCrude Oil Acquisition Agreements\nWe currently purchase all of our crude and feedstock needs independently from a variety of suppliers on the spot market or through term agreements for our Delaware City refinery. We have a contract with Saudi Aramco pursuant to which we have been purchasing up to approximately 100,000 bpd of crude oil from Saudi Aramco that is processed at our Paulsboro refinery. Prior to December 31, 2015, we had a crude oil supply contract with a third-party for our Delaware City refinery. We currently fully source our own crude oil needs for our Toledo refinery. Prior to July 31, 2014, we had a crude oil acquisition agreement with a third party that expired on July 31, 2014. In connection with the Chalmette Acquisition we entered into a contract with PDVSA for the supply of 40,000 to 60,000 bpd of crude oil that can be processed at any of our East or Gulf Coast refineries. In connection with the closing of the Torrance Acquisition, we entered into a crude supply agreement with ExxonMobil for approximately 60,000 bpd of crude oil that can be processed at our Torrance refinery.\nTax Receivable Agreement\nIn connection with our initial public offering, we entered into a tax receivable agreement pursuant to which we are required to pay the members of PBF LLC, who exchange their units for PBF Energy Class A common stock or whose units we purchase, approximately 85% of the cash savings in income taxes that we realize as a result of the increase in the tax basis of our interest in PBF LLC, including tax benefits attributable to payments made under the tax receivable agreement. We have recognized, as of\nDecember 31, 2016\n, a liability for the tax receivable agreement of\n$611.4 million\n, reflecting our estimate of the undiscounted amounts that we expect to pay under the agreement due to exchanges including those in connection with our IPO and our secondary offerings. Our estimate of the tax receivable agreement liability is based, in part, on forecasts of future taxable income over the anticipated life of our future business operations, assuming no material changes in the relevant tax law. Periodically, we may adjust the liability based, in part, on an updated estimate of the amounts that we expect to pay, using assumptions consistent with those used in our concurrent estimate of the deferred tax asset valuation allowance. For example, we must adjust the estimated tax receivable agreement liability each time we purchase PBF LLC Series A Units or upon an exchange of PBF LLC Series A Units for our Class A common stock. These periodic adjustments to the tax receivable liability, if any, are recorded in general and administrative expense and may result in adjustments to our income tax expense and deferred tax assets and liabilities.\nShare Repurchase Program\nOur Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of up to\n$300.0\nmillion of our Class A common stock. On September 26, 2016, our Board of Directors approved a two year extension to the existing Repurchase Program. As a result of the extension, the Repurchase Program will expire on September 30, 2018. No repurchases of the Company's Class A common stock were made during the year ended\nDecember 31, 2016\n. As of\nDecember 31, 2016\nwe have purchased approximately\n6.05 million\nshares of our Class A common stock under the Repurchase Program for\n$150.8\nmillion through open market transactions. We currently have the ability to purchase approximately an additional\n$149.2\nmillion in common stock under the approved Repurchase Program.\nThese repurchases may be made from time to time through various methods, including open market transactions, block trades, accelerated share repurchases, privately negotiated transactions or otherwise, certain of which may be effected through Rule 10b5-1 and Rule 10b-18 plans. The timing and number of shares repurchased will depend on a variety of factors, including price, capital availability, legal requirements and economic and market conditions. We are not obligated to purchase any shares under the Repurchase Program, and repurchases may be suspended or discontinued at any time without prior notice.\nRenewable Fuels Standard\nWe have seen fluctuations in the cost of renewable fuel credits, known as RINs, required for compliance with the RFS. We incurred approximately\n$347.5 million\nin RINs costs during the year ended\nDecember 31, 2016\nas\n65\ncompared to\n$171.6 million\nand\n$115.7 million\nduring the years ended\nDecember 31, 2015\nand\n2014\n, respectively. The fluctuations in RINs costs are due primarily to volatility in prices for ethanol-linked RINs and increases in our production of on-road transportation fuels since 2012. Our RINs purchase obligation is dependent on our actual shipment of on-road transportation fuels domestically and the amount of blending achieved.\nFactors Affecting Operating Results\nOverview\nOur earnings and cash flows from operations are primarily affected by the relationship between refined product prices and the prices for crude oil and other feedstocks. The cost to acquire crude oil and other feedstocks and the price of refined petroleum products ultimately sold depends on numerous factors beyond our control, including the supply of, and demand for, crude oil, gasoline, diesel and other refined petroleum products, which, in turn, depend on, among other factors, changes in global and regional economies, weather conditions, global and regional political affairs, production levels, the availability of imports, the marketing of competitive fuels, pipeline capacity, prevailing exchange rates and the extent of government regulation. Our revenue and operating income fluctuate significantly with movements in industry refined petroleum product prices, our materials cost fluctuate significantly with movements in crude oil prices and our other operating expenses fluctuate with movements in the price of energy to meet the power needs of our refineries. In addition, the effect of changes in crude oil prices on our operating results is influenced by how the prices of refined products adjust to reflect such changes.\nCrude oil and other feedstock costs and the prices of refined petroleum products have historically been subject to wide fluctuation. Expansion and upgrading of existing facilities and installation of additional refinery distillation or conversion capacity, price volatility, international political and economic developments and other factors beyond our control are likely to continue to play an important role in refining industry economics. These factors can impact, among other things, the level of inventories in the market, resulting in price volatility and a reduction or increase in product margins. Moreover, the industry typically experiences seasonal fluctuations in demand for refined petroleum products, such as for gasoline and diesel, during the summer driving season and for home heating oil during the winter.\nBenchmark Refining Margins\nIn assessing our operating performance, we compare the refining margins (revenue less materials cost) of each of our refineries against a specific benchmark industry refining margin based on crack spreads. Benchmark refining margins take into account both crude and refined petroleum product prices. When these prices are combined in a formula they provide a single value\u2014a gross margin per barrel\u2014that, when multiplied by throughput, provides an approximation of the gross margin generated by refining activities.\nThe performance of our East Coast refineries generally follows the Dated Brent (NYH) 2-1-1 benchmark refining margin. Our Toledo refinery generally follows the WTI (Chicago) 4-3-1 benchmark refining margin. Our Chalmette refinery generally follows the LLS (Gulf Coast) 2-1-1 benchmark refining margin. Our Torrance refinery generally follows the ANS (West Coast) 4-3-1 benchmark refining margin.\nWhile the benchmark refinery margins presented below under \u201cResults of Operations\u2014Market Indicators\u201d are representative of the results of our refineries, each refinery\u2019s realized gross margin on a per barrel basis will differ from the benchmark due to a variety of factors affecting the performance of the relevant refinery to its corresponding benchmark. These factors include the refinery\u2019s actual type of crude oil throughput, product yield differentials and any other factors not reflected in the benchmark refining margins, such as transportation costs, storage costs, credit fees, fuel consumed during production and any product premiums or discounts, as well as inventory fluctuations, timing of crude oil and other feedstock purchases, a rising or declining crude and product pricing environment and commodity price management activities. As discussed in more detail below, each of our refineries, depending on market conditions, has certain feedstock-cost and product-value advantages and disadvantages as compared to the refinery\u2019s relevant benchmark.\nCredit Risk Management\nCredit risk refers to the risk that a counterparty will default on its contractual obligations resulting in financial loss to us. Our exposure to credit risk is reflected in the carrying amount of the receivables that are presented in our balance sheet. To minimize credit risk, all customers are subject to extensive credit verification procedures and extensions of credit above defined thresholds are to be approved by the senior management. Our intention is to trade only with recognized creditworthy third parties. In addition, receivable balances are monitored on an ongoing basis. We also limit the risk of bad debts by obtaining security such as guarantees or letters of credit.\n66\nOther Factors\nWe currently source our crude oil for the Paulsboro, Delaware City, Toledo, Chalmette and Torrance refineries on a global basis through a combination of market purchases and short-term purchase contracts, and through our crude oil supply agreements with Saudi Aramco, PDVSA and ExxonMobil. We have been purchasing up to approximately 100,000 bpd of crude oil from Saudi Aramco that is processed at Paulsboro. We have a contract with PDVSA for the supply of 40,000 to 60,000 bpd of crude oil that can be processed at any of our East or Gulf Coast refineries. Additionally, we have a supply agreement with ExxonMobil for approximately 60,000 bpd of crude oil that can be processed at our Torrance refinery. We believe purchases based on market pricing has given us flexibility in obtaining crude oil at lower prices and on a more accurate \u201cas needed\u201d basis. Since our Paulsboro and Delaware City refineries access their crude slates from the Delaware River via ship or barge and through our rail facilities at Delaware City, these refineries have the flexibility to purchase crude oils from the Mid-Continent and Western Canada, as well as a number of different countries.\nIn the past several years, we expanded and upgraded the existing on-site railroad infrastructure at the Delaware City refinery. Currently, crude oil delivered by rail to this facility is consumed at our Delaware City and Paulsboro refineries. The Delaware City rail unloading facility, which was transferred to PBFX in 2014, allows our East Coast refineries to source WTI-based crude oils from Western Canada and the Mid-Continent, which we believe, at times, may provide cost advantages versus traditional Brent-based international crude oils. In support of this rail strategy, we have at times entered into agreements to lease or purchase crude railcars. A portion of these railcars were purchased via the Rail Facility entered into during 2014, which was terminated in connection with the execution of the PBF Rail Term Loan in 2016. Certain of these railcars were subsequently sold to a third party, which has leased the railcars back to us for periods of between four and seven years. In 2016, we sold approximately 120 of these railcars to optimize our railcar portfolio. Our railcar fleet, at times, provides transportation flexibility within our crude oil sourcing strategy that allows our East Coast refineries to process cost advantaged crude from Canada and the Mid-Continent.\nOur operating cost structure is also important to our profitability. Major operating costs include costs relating to employees and contract labor, energy, maintenance and environmental compliance, and emission control regulations, including the cost of RINs required for compliance with the Renewable Fuels Standard. The predominant variable cost is energy, in particular, the price of utilities, natural gas, electricity and chemicals.\nOur operating results are also affected by the reliability of our refinery operations. Unplanned downtime of our refinery assets generally results in lost margin opportunity and increased maintenance expense. The financial impact of planned downtime, such as major turnaround maintenance, is managed through a planning process that considers such things as the margin environment, the availability of resources to perform the needed maintenance and feed logistics, whereas unplanned downtime does not afford us this opportunity.\nRefinery-Specific Information\nThe following section includes refinery-specific information related to our operations, crude oil differentials, ancillary costs, and local premiums and discounts.\nDelaware City Refinery.\nThe benchmark refining margin for the Delaware City refinery is calculated by assuming that two barrels of Dated Brent crude oil are converted into one barrel of gasoline and one barrel of diesel. We calculate this benchmark using the NYH market value of reformulated blendstock for oxygenate blending (\"RBOB\") and ULSD against the market value of Dated Brent and refer to the benchmark as the Dated Brent (NYH) 2-1-1 benchmark refining margin. Our Delaware City refinery has a product slate of approximately 53% gasoline, 30% distillate (consisting of jet fuel, ULSD and ultra-low sulfur heating oil), 1% high-value petrochemicals, with the remaining portion of the product slate comprised of lower-value products (6% black oil, 4% petroleum coke, 3% LPGs and 3% other). For this reason, we believe the Dated Brent (NYH) 2-1-1 is an appropriate benchmark industry refining margin. The majority of Delaware City revenues are generated off NYH-based market prices.\nThe Delaware City refinery\u2019s realized gross margin on a per barrel basis has historically differed from the Dated Brent (NYH) 2-1-1 benchmark refining margin due to the following factors.\n\u2022\nthe Delaware City refinery processes a slate of primarily medium and heavy sour crude oils, which has constituted approximately 65% to 70% of total throughput. The remaining throughput consists of sweet crude oil and other feedstocks and blendstocks. In addition, we have the capability to process a significant volume of light, sweet crude oil depending on market conditions. Our total throughput costs have historically priced at a discount to Dated Brent; and\n67\n\u2022\nas a result of the heavy, sour crude slate processed at Delaware City, we produce lower value products including sulfur, carbon dioxide and petroleum coke. These products are priced at a significant discount to gasoline, ULSD and heating oil and represent approximately 5% to 7% of our total production volume.\nPaulsboro Refinery.\nThe benchmark refining margin for the Paulsboro refinery is calculated by assuming that two barrels of Dated Brent crude oil are converted into one barrel of gasoline and one barrel of diesel. We calculate this benchmark using the NYH market value of RBOB and ULSD diesel against the market value of Dated Brent and refer to the benchmark as the Dated Brent (NYH) 2-1-1 benchmark refining margin. Our Paulsboro refinery has a product slate of approximately 38% gasoline, 32% distillate (comprised of jet fuel, ULSD and ultra-low sulfur heating oil), 5% high-value Group I lubricants and 10% asphalt, with the remaining portion of the product slate comprised of lower-value products (6% black oil, 4% petroleum coke, 4% LPGs and 1% other). For this reason, we believe the Dated Brent (NYH) 2-1-1 is an appropriate benchmark industry refining margin. The majority of Paulsboro revenues are generated off NYH-based market prices.\nThe Paulsboro refinery\u2019s realized gross margin on a per barrel basis has historically differed from the Dated Brent (NYH) 2-1-1 benchmark refining margin due to the following factors.\n\u2022\nthe Paulsboro refinery has generally processed a slate of primarily medium and heavy sour crude oils, which has historically constituted approximately 70% to 80% of total throughput. The remaining throughput consists of sweet crude oil and other feedstocks and blendstocks;\n\u2022\nas a result of the heavy, sour crude slate processed at Paulsboro, we produce lower value products including sulfur and petroleum coke. These products are priced at a significant discount to gasoline and heating oil and represent approximately 3% to 5% of our total production volume; and\n\u2022\nthe Paulsboro refinery produces Group I lubricants which carry a premium sales price to gasoline and distillates.\nToledo Refinery.\nThe benchmark refining margin for the Toledo refinery is calculated by assuming that four barrels of WTI crude oil are converted into three barrels of gasoline, one-half barrel of ULSD and one-half barrel of jet fuel. We calculate this refining margin using the Chicago market values of conventional blendstock for oxygenate blending (\"CBOB\") and ULSD and the United States Gulf Coast value of jet fuel against the market value of WTI crude oil and refer to this benchmark as the WTI (Chicago) 4-3-1 benchmark refining margin. Our Toledo refinery has a product slate of approximately 54% gasoline, 35% distillate (comprised of jet fuel and ULSD), 5% high-value petrochemicals (including nonene, tetramer, benzene, xylene and toluene) with the remaining portion of the product slate comprised of lower-value products (5% LPGs and 1% other). For this reason, we believe the WTI (Chicago) 4-3-1 is an appropriate benchmark industry refining margin. The majority of Toledo revenues are generated off Chicago-based market prices.\nThe Toledo refinery\u2019s realized gross margin on a per barrel basis has historically differed from the WTI (Chicago) 4-3-1 benchmark refining margin due to the following factors.\n\u2022\nthe Toledo refinery processes a slate of domestic sweet and Canadian synthetic crude oil. Historically, Toledo\u2019s blended average crude costs have been higher than the market value of WTI crude oil;\n\u2022\nthe Toledo refinery configuration enables it to produce more barrels of product than throughput which generates a pricing benefit; and\n\u2022\nthe Toledo refinery generates a pricing benefit on some of its refined products, primarily its petrochemicals.\nChalmette Refinery.\nThe benchmark refining margin for the Chalmette refinery is calculated by assuming two barrels of Light Louisiana Sweet (\"LLS\") crude oil are converted into one barrel of gasoline and one barrel of diesel. We calculate this benchmark using the US Gulf Coast market value of 87 conventional gasoline and ULSD against the market value of LLS and refer to this benchmark as the LLS (Gulf Coast) 2-1-1 benchmark refining margin. Our Chalmette refinery has a product slate of approximately 48% gasoline, 31% distillate (comprised of ULSD, heating oil, and light cycle oil), 5% high-value petrochemicals (including benzene and xylenes) with the remaining portion of the product slate comprised of lower-value products (10% black oil, 5% petroleum coke and 1% other). For this reason, we believe the LLS (Gulf Coast) 2-1-1 is an appropriate benchmark industry refining margin. The majority of Chalmette revenues are generated off Gulf Coast-based market prices.\nThe Chalmette refinery\u2019s realized gross margin on a per barrel basis has historically differed from the LLS (USGC) 2-1-1 benchmark refining margin due to the following factors.\n68\n\u2022\nThe Chalmette refinery has generally processed a slate of primarily medium and heavy sour crude oils, which has historically constituted approximately 60% to 70% of total throughput. The remaining throughput consists of sweet crude oil and other feedstocks and blendstocks; and\n\u2022\nas a result of the heavy, sour crude slate processed at Chalmette, we produce lower-value products including sulfur and petroleum coke. These products are priced at a significant discount to gasoline and heating oil and represent approximately 4% to 6% of our total production volume.\nA project underway to restart an idled naphtha hydrotreater, reformer and light-ends recovery unit will increase high-octane, ultra-low sulfur reformate and chemicals production. A new crude oil tank being constructed will allow gasoline and diesel export opportunities and reduce Renewable Identification Numbers (\u201cRINs\u201d) compliance costs. Both projects are expected to be completed in the third quarter of 2017.\nTorrance Refinery.\nThe benchmark refining margin for the Torrance refinery is calculated by assuming that four barrels of Alaskan North Slope (\u201cANS\u201d) crude oil are converted into three barrels of gasoline, one-half barrel of diesel and one-half barrel of jet fuel. We calculate this benchmark using the West Coast Los Angeles market value of California reformulated blendstock for oxygenate blending (CARBOB), California Air Resources Board (CARB) diesel and jet fuel and refer to the benchmark as the ANS (WCLA) 4-3-1 benchmark refining margin. Our Torrance Refinery has a product slate of approximately 62% gasoline and 25% distillate (comprised of jet fuel, ULSD and marine diesel) with the remaining portion of the product slate comprised of lower-value products (8% petroleum coke, 2% LPG, 2% black oil and 1% other). For this reason, we believe the ANS (West Coast) 4-3-1 is an appropriate benchmark industry refining margin. The majority of Torrance revenues are generated off West Coast Los Angeles-based market prices.\nThe Torrance refinery\u2019s realized gross margin on a per barrel basis has historically differed from the ANS (WCLA) 4-3-1 benchmark refining margin due to the following factors.\n\u2022\nThe Torrance Refinery has generally processed a slate of primarily heavy sour crude oils, which has historically constituted approximately 80% to 90% of total throughput. The Torrance crude slate has the lowest API gravity (typically an American Petroleum Institute (\"API\") gravity of less than 20 degrees) of all of our refineries. The remaining throughput consists of other feedstocks and blendstocks; and\n\u2022\nas a result of the heavy, sour crude slate processed at Torrance, we produce lower-value products including petroleum coke and sulfur. These products are priced at a significant discount to gasoline and diesel and represent approximately 9% to 11% of our total production volume.\n69\nResults of Operations\nThe tables below reflect our consolidated financial and operating highlights for the years ended\nDecember 31, 2016\n,\n2015\nand\n2014\n(amounts in thousands, except per share data). Effective with the completion of the PBFX Offering in May 2014, we operate in two reportable business segments: Refining and Logistics. Our oil refineries, excluding the assets owned by PBFX, are all engaged in the refining of crude oil and other feedstocks into petroleum products, and are aggregated into the Refining segment. PBFX is a publicly traded master limited partnership that operates certain logistical assets such as crude oil and refined petroleum products terminals, pipelines and storage facilities. PBFX's operations are aggregated into the Logistics segment. Prior to the PBFX Offering and PBFX's acquisition of the DCR West Rack, the Toledo Storage Facility, the Delaware City Products Pipeline and Truck Rack, and the Torrance Valley Pipeline, PBFX's assets were operated within the refining operations of our Delaware City, Toledo and Torrance refineries and did not generate third party revenue nor, apart from Delaware Pipeline Company LLC, any intra-entity revenue and were not considered to be a separate reportable segment. We did not analyze our results by individual segments as, apart from the East Coast Terminals, our Logistics segment did not have any third party revenue and a significant portion of its operating results eliminate in consolidation.\nYear Ended December 31,\n2016\n2015\n2014\nRevenue\n$15,920,424\n$13,123,929\n$19,828,155\nCost of sales, excluding depreciation\n13,598,341\n11,481,614\n18,471,203\n2,322,083\n1,642,315\n1,356,952\nOperating expenses, excluding depreciation\n1,423,198\n904,525\n883,140\nGeneral and administrative expenses\n166,452\n181,266\n146,661\nLoss (gain) on sale of assets\n11,374\n(1,004\n)\n(895\n)\nDepreciation and amortization expense\n222,176\n197,417\n180,382\nIncome from operations\n498,883\n360,111\n147,664\nChange in tax receivable agreement liability\n12,908\n18,150\n2,990\nChange in fair value of catalyst leases\n1,422\n10,184\n3,969\nInterest expense, net\n(150,045\n)\n(106,187\n)\n(98,764\n)\nIncome before income taxes\n363,168\n282,258\n55,859\nIncome tax expense (benefit)\n137,650\n86,725\n(22,412\n)\nNet income\n225,518\n195,533\n78,271\nLess: net income attributable to noncontrolling interest\n54,707\n49,132\n116,508\nNet income (loss) attributable to PBF Energy Inc. stockholders\n$170,811\n$146,401\n$(38,237\n)\nGross margin\n$727,496\n$571,524\n$308,399\nGross refining margin\n(1)\n2,143,449\n1,512,330\n1,314,101\nNet income (loss) available to Class A common stock per share.\nBasic\n$1.74\n$1.66\n$(0.51\n)\nDiluted\n$1.74\n$1.65\n$(0.51\n)\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n(1) See Non-GAAP Financial Measures below.\n70\nOperating Highlights\nYear Ended December 31,\n2016\n2015\n2014\nKey Operating Information\nProduction (bpd in thousands)\n734.3\n511.9\n452.1\nCrude oil and feedstocks throughput (bpd in thousands)\n727.7\n516.4\n453.1\nTotal crude oil and feedstocks throughput (millions of barrels)\n266.4\n188.4\n165.4\nGross margin per barrel of throughput\n$2.73\n$3.03\n$1.86\nGross refining margin, excluding special items per barrel of throughput\n(1)\n$6.09\n$10.29\n$12.11\nRefinery operating expense, excluding depreciation, per barrel of throughput\n$5.22\n$4.72\n$5.34\nCrude and feedstocks (% of total throughput)\n(2)\nHeavy Crude\n26%\n14%\n14%\nMedium Crude\n37%\n49%\n44%\nLight Crude\n25%\n26%\n33%\nOther feedstocks and blends\n12%\n11%\n9%\nTotal throughput\n100%\n100%\n100%\nYield (% of total throughput)\nGasoline and gasoline blendstocks\n50%\n49%\n47%\nDistillates and distillate blendstocks\n31%\n35%\n36%\nLubes\n1%\n1%\n2%\nChemicals\n3%\n3%\n3%\nOther\n15%\n12%\n12%\nTotal yield\n100%\n100%\n100%\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n(1) See Non-GAAP Financial Measures below.\n(2) We define heavy crude oil as crude oil with American Petroleum Institute (API) gravity less than 24 degrees.

Excluding the impact of the net change in LCM reserve, our results were negatively impacted by unfavorable movements in certain crude oil differentials, lower crack spreads, increased costs to comply with the RFS, and increased interest costs partially offset by positive earnings contributions from the Chalmette and Torrance refineries and higher throughput in the Mid-Continent. Throughput volumes for 2015 in the Mid-Continent were impacted by unplanned downtime in the second quarter of 2015.\nRevenues\u2014\nRevenues totaled\n$15.9 billion\nfor the year ended\nDecember 31, 2016\ncompared to\n$13.1 billion\nfor the year ended\nDecember 31, 2015\n,\nan increase\nof approximately\n$2.8 billion\nor\n21.3%\n. Revenues per barrel were\n$59.77\nand\n$69.66\nfor the years ended\nDecember 31, 2016\nand\n2015\n, respectively, a decrease of\n14.2%\ndirectly related to lower hydrocarbon commodity prices. For the year ended\nDecember 31, 2016\n, the total throughput rates at our East Coast, Mid-\n72\nContinent and Gulf Coast refineries averaged approximately\n327,000\nbpd,\n159,100\nbpd and\n169,300\nbpd, respectively. For the period from its acquisition on July 1, 2016 through\nDecember 31, 2016\n, our West Coast refinery's throughput averaged\n143,900\nbpd. For the year ended\nDecember 31, 2015\n, the total throughput rates at our East Coast and Mid-Continent refineries averaged approximately\n330,700\nbpd and\n153,800\nbpd, respectively. For the period from its acquisition on November 1, 2015 through December 31, 2015, our Gulf Coast refinery's throughput averaged\n190,800\nbpd. The slight decrease in throughput rates at our East Coast refineries in\n2016\ncompared to\n2015\nis primarily due to weather-related unplanned downtime at our Delaware City refinery in the first quarter of\n2016\n, partially offset by downtime at our Delaware City refinery in\n2015\n. The increase in throughout rates at our Mid-Continent refinery in\n2016\nis due to unplanned downtime in the second quarter of\n2015\n. Our Gulf Coast and West Coast refineries were not acquired until the fourth quarter of\n2015\nand third quarter of\n2016\n, respectively. For the year ended\nDecember 31, 2016\n, the total refined product barrels sold at our East Coast, Mid-Continent and Gulf Coast refineries averaged approximately\n364,100\nbpd,\n171,800\nbpd and\n206,400\nbpd, respectively. For the period from its acquisition on July 1, 2016 through\nDecember 31, 2016\n, refined product barrels sold at our West Coast refinery averaged approximately\n179,200\nbpd. For the year ended\nDecember 31, 2015\n, the total refined product barrels sold at our East Coast and Mid-Continent refineries averaged approximately\n366,100\nbpd and\n162,600\nbpd, respectively. For the period from its acquisition on November 1, 2015 through December 31, 2015, the total refined product barrels sold at our Gulf Coast refinery averaged\n216,100\nbpd. Total refined product barrels sold were higher than throughput rates, reflecting sales from inventory as well as sales and purchases of refined products outside the refineries.\nGross Margin\u2014\nGross margin, including refinery operating expenses and depreciation, totaled\n$727.5 million\n, or\n$2.73\nper barrel of throughput, for the year ended\nDecember 31, 2016\n, compared to\n$571.5 million\n, or\n$3.03\nper barrel of throughput, for the year ended\nDecember 31, 2015\n,\nan increase\nof\n$156.0 million\n. Gross refining margin (as defined below in Non-GAAP Financial Measures) totaled\n$2,143.4 million\n, or\n$8.05\nper barrel of throughput (\n$1,622.1 million\nor\n$6.09\nper barrel of throughput excluding the impact of special items), for the year ended\nDecember 31, 2016\ncompared to\n$1,512.3 million\n, or\n$8.02\nper barrel of throughput (\n$1,939.6 million\nor\n$10.29\nper barrel of throughput excluding the impact of special items), for the year ended\nDecember 31, 2015\n, an increase of approximately\n$631.1 million\nor a decrease of\n$317.5 million\nexcluding special items. Excluding the impact of special items, gross margin and gross refining margin decreased due to unfavorable movements in certain crude differentials, lower crack spreads as persistent above-average refined product inventory levels weighed on margins, and increased costs to comply with the RFS, partially offset by higher throughput rates in the Mid-Continent and positive margin contributions from the Chalmette and Torrance refineries acquired in the fourth quarter of\n2015\nand third quarter of\n2016\n, respectively. Costs to comply with our obligation under the RFS totaled\n$236.2\nmillion for the year ended\nDecember 31, 2016\n(excluding our Gulf Coast and West Coast refineries, whose costs to comply with RFS totaled\n$111.3\nmillion for the year ended\nDecember 31, 2016\n) compared to $163.6 million for the year ended\nDecember 31, 2015\n(excluding our Gulf Coast refinery, whose costs to comply with RFS totaled $8.0 million for the year ended\nDecember 31, 2015\n). In addition, gross margin and gross refining margin were positively impacted by a non-cash LCM adjustment of approximately\n$521.3 million\nresulting from the change in crude oil and refined product prices from the year ended\n2015\nto the year ended\n2016\nwhich, while remaining below historical costs, increased since the prior year end. The non-cash LCM adjustment decreased gross margin and gross refining margin by approximately\n$427.2 million\nin the year ended\nDecember 31, 2015.\nAverage industry refining margins in the Mid-Continent were weaker during the year ended\nDecember 31, 2016\n, as compared to the same period in\n2015\n. The WTI (Chicago) 4-3-1 industry crack spread was\n$12.38\nper barrel, or\n30.9%\nlower, in the year ended\nDecember 31, 2016\n, as compared to\n$17.91\nper barrel in the same period in\n2015\n. Our margins were negatively impacted from our refinery specific crude slate in the Mid-Continent which was impacted by a declining WTI\/Bakken differential and a declining WTI\/Syncrude differential, which averaged a premium of\n$2.01\nper barrel for the year ended\nDecember 31, 2016\nas compared to a premium of\n$1.45\nper barrel in the same period in\n2015.\nThe Dated Brent (NYH) 2-1-1 industry crack spread was approximately\n$13.49\nper barrel, or\n17.5%\nlower, in the year ended\nDecember 31, 2016\n, as compared to\n$16.35\nper barrel in the same period in\n2015\n. The Dated Brent\/WTI differential and Dated Brent\/Maya differential were\n$3.29\nand\n$1.09\nlower, respectively, in the year ended\nDecember 31, 2016\n, as compared to the same period in\n2015\n. In addition, the WTI\/Bakken differential was approximately\n$1.57\nper barrel less favorable in the year ended\nDecember 31, 2016\nas compared to the same period in\n2015\n. Reductions in these benchmark crude differentials typically result in higher crude costs and negatively impact our earnings.\nOperating Expenses\n\u2014 Operating expenses totaled\n$1,423.2 million\nfor the year ended\nDecember 31, 2016\ncompared to\n$904.5 million\nfor the year ended\nDecember 31, 2015\n, an\nincrease\nof\n$518.7 million\n, or\n57.3%\n. Of the total\n$1,423.2 million\nof operating expenses, approximately\n$1,390.6 million\n, or\n$5.22\nper barrel of throughput, related to expenses incurred by the Refining segment, while the remaining\n$32.6 million\nrelated to expenses incurred by the Logistics segment (\n$15.1 million\nof operating expenses for the year ended\nDecember 31, 2015\nrelated to the Logistics segment). The increase in operating expenses was mainly attributable to the operating expenses associated with the Chalmette and Torrance refineries and related logistics assets. For the year ended\nDecember 31, 2016\nand for the period from its acquisition on\n73\nNovember 1, 2015 to\nDecember 31, 2015\n, the Chalmette refinery and related logistics assets incurred operating expenses of approximately\n$343.9\nmillion and\n$52.1\nmillion, respectively. In the period from its acquisition on July 1, 2016 to\nDecember 31, 2016\n, the Torrance refinery and related logistics assets incurred operating expenses of approximately\n$250.5\nmillion. Total operating expenses at our refineries, excluding our Chalmette and Torrance refineries, decreased slightly for the year ended\nDecember 31, 2016\n, primarily due to lower energy costs and maintenance costs. The reduction in energy costs was mainly due to lower natural gas prices while the reduction in maintenance costs was mainly due to timing of repairs and certain non-recurring maintenance costs incurred in 2015. These reductions were partially offset by higher employee-related expenses, primarily attributable to merit increases in salaries. The operating expenses related to the Logistics segment consists of costs related to the operation and maintenance of PBFX's assets, which were higher primarily due to the PBFX Plains Asset Purchase in 2016 and the acquisition from PBF LLC of 50% of the issued and outstanding limited liability company interests of TVPC.\nGeneral and Administrative Expenses\n\u2014 General and administrative expenses totaled\n$166.5 million\nfor the year ended\nDecember 31, 2016\n, compared to\n$181.3 million\nfor the year ended\nDecember 31, 2015\n,\na decrease\nof\n$14.8 million\nor\n8.2%\n. The decrease in general and administrative expenses for the year ended\nDecember 31, 2016\nover 2015 primarily relates to reduced employee related expenses of $39.3 million mainly due to lower incentive compensation expenses, partially offset by $15.6 million in additional outside services costs to support our acquisitions and related integration activities, an increase of $9.2 million in equity compensation expense related to incremental grants in 2016 and accelerated vesting of awards due to retirements, as well as increased expenses of $3.1 million at PBFX, primarily as a result of the PBFX Plains Asset Purchase. Our general and administrative expenses are comprised of the personnel, facilities and other infrastructure costs necessary to support our refineries.\nLoss (gain) on Sale of Assets\n\u2014 There was a loss of\n$11.4 million\non sale of assets for the year ended\nDecember 31, 2016\nrelating to the sale of non-refining assets as compared to a gain of\n$1.0 million\nfor the year ended\nDecember 31, 2015\nwhich related to the sale of railcars which were subsequently leased back.\nDepreciation and Amortization Expense\n\u2014 Depreciation and amortization expense totaled\n$222.2 million\nfor the year ended\nDecember 31, 2016\n, compared to\n$197.4 million\nfor the year ended\nDecember 31, 2015\n,\nan increase\nof\n$24.8 million\n. The increase was a result of additional depreciation expense associated with the assets acquired in the Chalmette and Torrance Acquisitions and the PBFX Plains Asset Purchase, and a general increase in our fixed asset base due to capital projects and turnarounds completed during 2016 and 2015.\nChange in Tax Receivable Agreement Liability\n\u2014\nChange in the tax receivable agreement liability for the year ended\nDecember 31, 2016\nrepresented a gain of\n$12.9 million\nas compared to a gain of\n$18.2 million\nfor the year ended\nDecember 31, 2015.\nChange in Fair Value of Catalyst Leases\n\u2014 Change in the fair value of catalyst leases represented a gain of\n$1.4 million\nfor the year ended\nDecember 31, 2016\n, compared to a gain of\n$10.2 million\nfor the year ended\nDecember 31, 2015\n. These  gains relate to the change in value of the precious metals underlying the sale and leaseback of our refineries\u2019 precious metals catalyst, which we are obligated to return or repurchase at fair market value on the lease termination dates.\nInterest Expense, net\u2014\nInterest expense totaled\n$150.0 million\nfor the year ended\nDecember 31, 2016\n, compared to\n$106.2 million\nfor the year ended\nDecember 31, 2015\n,\nan increase\nof\n$43.8 million\n. This increase is mainly attributable to higher interest costs associated with the issuance of the 2023 Senior Secured Notes in November 2015 and the drawdown on our Revolving Loan to partially fund the Torrance Acquisition in July 2016, partially offset by lower letter of credit fees. Interest expense includes interest on long-term debt including the PBFX credit facilities, costs related to the sale and leaseback of our precious metals catalyst, financing costs associated with the A&R Inventory Intermediation Agreements with J. Aron, letter of credit fees associated with the purchase of certain crude oils, and the amortization of deferred financing costs.\nIncome Tax Expense\u2014\nPBF LLC is organized as a limited liability company and PBFX is a master limited partnership, both of which are treated as \u201cflow-through\u201d entities for federal income tax purposes and therefore are not subject to income tax, although certain subsidiaries of PBF Holding that are treated as C-Corporations for income tax purposes may have an income tax expense with respect to their income and gain, if any. The members of PBF LLC are required to include their proportionate share of PBF LLC\u2019s taxable income or loss, which includes PBF LLC\u2019s allocable share of PBFX\u2019s pre-tax income or loss, on their respective tax returns. PBF LLC generally makes distributions to its members, per the terms of PBF LLC's amended and restated limited liability company agreement, related to such taxes on a pro-rata basis. PBF Energy recognizes an income tax expense or benefit in our consolidated financial statements based on PBF Energy's allocable share of PBF LLC\u2019s pre-tax income or loss, which was approximately\n95.3%\nand\n94.0%\n, on a weighted-average basis for the years ended\nDecember 31, 2016\nand\n2015\n, respectively. PBF Energy's consolidated financial statements do\n74\nnot reflect any benefit or provision for income taxes on the pre-tax income or loss attributable to the noncontrolling interests in PBF LLC or PBFX (although, as described above, PBF LLC must make tax distributions to all its members on a pro-rata basis). PBF Energy's effective tax rate, excluding the impact of noncontrolling interest, for the years ended\nDecember 31, 2016\nand\n2015\nwas\n37.9%\nand\n30.7%\n, respectively, reflecting tax adjustments for discrete items and the impact of tax return to income tax provision adjustments.\nNoncontrolling Interests\u2014\nPBF Energy is the sole managing member of, and has a controlling interest in, PBF LLC. As the sole managing member of PBF LLC, PBF Energy operates and controls all of the business and affairs of PBF LLC and its subsidiaries. PBF Energy consolidates the financial results of PBF LLC and its subsidiaries, including PBFX. With respect to the consolidation of PBF LLC, the Company records a noncontrolling interest for the economic interest in PBF LLC held by members other than PBF Energy, and with respect to the consolidation of PBFX, the Company records a noncontrolling interest for the economic interests in PBFX held by the public unit holders of PBFX, and with respect to the consolidation of PBF Holding, the Company records a 20% noncontrolling interest for the ownership interests in two subsidiaries of Chalmette Refining held by a third party. The total noncontrolling interest on the consolidated statement of operations represents the portion of the Company\u2019s earnings or loss attributable to the economic interests held by members of PBF Energy other than PBF Energy and by the public common unit holders of PBFX and by the third party holder of certain of Chalmette Refining's subsidiaries. The total noncontrolling interest on the balance sheet represents the portion of the Company\u2019s net assets attributable to the economic interests held by the members of PBF LLC other than PBF Energy, by the public common unit holders of PBFX and by the third party stockholder of T&M Terminal Company and Collins Pipeline Company. PBF Energy's weighted-average equity noncontrolling interest ownership percentage in PBF LLC for the years ended\nDecember 31, 2016\nand\n2015\nwas approximately\n4.7%\nand\n6.0%\n, respectively. The carrying amount of the noncontrolling interest on our consolidated balance sheet attributable to the noncontrolling interest is not equal to the noncontrolling interest ownership percentage due to the effect of income taxes and related agreements that pertain solely to PBF Energy.\n2015\nCompared to\n2014\nOverview\u2014Net income for PBF Energy was\n$195.5 million\nfor the year ended\nDecember 31, 2015\ncompared to\n$78.3 million\nfor the year ended\nDecember 31, 2014\n. Net income attributable to PBF Energy was\n$146.4 million\n, or\n$1.65\nper diluted share (\n$1.65\nper share on a fully exchanged, fully diluted basis based on adjusted fully-converted net income, or\n$4.27\nper share on a fully exchanged, fully diluted basis based on adjusted fully-converted net income excluding special items, as described below in Non-GAAP Financial Measures), for the year ended\nDecember 31, 2015\ncompared to net loss attributable to PBF Energy of\n$38.2 million\n, or\n$0.51\nper diluted share (\n$0.24\nnet income per share on a fully exchanged, fully diluted basis based on adjusted fully-converted net income, or\n$4.50\nnet income per share on a fully exchanged, fully diluted basis based in adjusted fully-converted net income excluding special items, as described below in Non-GAAP Financial Measures), for the year ended\nDecember 31, 2014\n. The net income attributable to PBF Energy represents PBF Energy\u2019s equity interest in PBF LLC's pre-tax income (loss), less applicable income taxes. PBF's Energy's weighted-average equity interest in PBF LLC was\n94.0%\nand\n77.9%\nfor the years ended\nDecember 31, 2015\nand\n2014\n, respectively.\nOur results for the year ended\nDecember 31, 2015\nwere negatively impacted by a non-cash special item consisting of a pre-tax inventory LCM adjustment of approximately\n$427.2\nmillion or\n$258.0\nmillion net of tax whereas our results for the year ended\nDecember 31, 2014\nwere negatively impacted by a pre-tax inventory LCM adjustment of approximately\n$690.1\nmillion or\n$412.7\nmillion net of tax. These LCM charges were recorded due to significant declines in the price of crude oil and refined products in\n2015\nand\n2014\n. Our throughput rates during the year ended\nDecember 31, 2015\ncompared to\nDecember 31, 2014\nwere higher due to the acquisition of the Chalmette refinery on November 1, 2015 as well as an approximate 40-day plant-wide planned turnaround at our Toledo Refinery completed in the fourth quarter of 2014. Our results for the year ended\nDecember 31, 2015\nwere positively impacted by higher throughput volumes, lower non-cash special items for LCM charges and higher crack spreads for the East Coast and in the Mid-Continent, partially offset by unfavorable movements in certain crude differentials.\nRevenues\u2014\nRevenues totaled\n$13.1 billion\nfor the year ended\nDecember 31, 2015\ncompared to\n$19.8 billion\nfor the year ended\nDecember 31, 2014\n,\na decrease\nof approximately\n$6.7 billion\n, or\n33.8%\n. Revenue per barrel were\n$69.66\nand\n$119.89\nfor the years ended\nDecember 31, 2015\nand\n2014\n, respectively, a decrease of\n41.9%\ndirectly related to lower hydrocarbon commodity prices. For the year ended\nDecember 31, 2015\n, the total throughput rates in the East Coast and Mid-Continent refineries averaged approximately\n330,700\nbpd and\n153,800\nbpd, respectively. For the period from its acquisition on November 1, 2015 through December 31, 2015, our Gulf Coast refinery's throughput averaged\n190,800\nbpd. For the year ended\nDecember 31, 2014\n, the total throughput rates at our East Coast and Mid-Continent refineries averaged approximately\n325,300\nbpd and\n127,800\nbpd, respectively. The increase in throughput rates at our East Coast refineries in\n2015\ncompared to\n2014\nwas primarily due to higher run rates as a result of favorable market economics partially offset by unplanned downtime at our Delaware City refinery in\n2015\n. The increase in throughput rates at our Mid-\n75\nContinent refinery in\n2015\ncompared to\n2014\nwas primarily due to an approximate 40-day plant-wide planned turnaround completed in the fourth quarter of 2014. For the year ended\nDecember 31, 2015\n, the total refined product barrels sold at our East Coast and Mid-Continent refineries averaged approximately\n366,100\nbpd and\n162,600\nbpd, respectively. For the year ended\nDecember 31, 2014\n, the total refined product barrels sold at our East Coast and Mid-Continent refineries averaged approximately\n350,800\nbpd and\n144,100\nbpd, respectively. For the period from its acquisition on November 1, 2015 through December 31, 2015, the total refined product barrels sold at our Gulf Coast refinery averaged\n216,100\nbpd. Total refined product barrels sold were higher than throughput rates, reflecting sales from inventory as well as sales and purchases of refined products outside the refinery.\nGross Margin\u2014\nGross margin, including refinery operating expenses and depreciation, totaled\n$571.5 million\n, or\n$3.03\nper barrel of throughput, for the year ended\nDecember 31, 2015\n, compared to\n$308.4 million\n, or\n$1.86\nper barrel of throughput, for the year ended\nDecember 31, 2014\n,\nan increase\nof\n$263.1 million\n. Gross refining margin (as defined below in Non-GAAP Financial Measures) totaled\n$1,512.3 million\n, or\n$8.02\nper barrel of throughput (\n$1,939.6 million\nor\n$10.29\nper barrel of throughput excluding the impact of special items) for the year ended\nDecember 31, 2015\ncompared to\n$1,314.1 million\n, or\n$7.94\nper barrel of throughput (\n$2,004.2 million\nor\n$12.11\nper barrel of throughput excluding the impact of special items), for the year ended\nDecember 31, 2014\n, an increase of approximately\n$198.2\nmillion or a decrease of approximately\n$64.6\nmillion excluding special items. Excluding the impact of special items, gross margin was relatively consistent with the prior year. Excluding the impact of special items, gross refining margin decreased due to the narrowing of certain crude differentials partially offset by higher throughput rates, reflecting the impact from the Chalmette Acquisition, and favorable movements in crack spreads.\nAverage industry refining margins in the U.S. Mid-Continent were generally improved during the year ended\nDecember 31, 2015\n, as compared to the same period in\n2014\n. The WTI (Chicago) 4-3-1 industry crack spread was approximately\n$17.91\nper barrel or\n12.5%\nhigher in the year ended\nDecember 31, 2015\n, as compared to the same period in\n2014\n. The price of WTI versus Dated Brent and other crude discounts narrowed during the year ended\nDecember 31, 2015\n, and our refinery specific crude slate in the Mid-Continent faced an adverse WTI\/Syncrude differential, which averaged a premium of\n$1.45\nper barrel for the year ended\nDecember 31, 2015\nas compared to a discount of\n$2.25\nper barrel in the same period in\n2014.\nThe Dated Brent (NYH) 2-1-1 industry crack spread was approximately\n$16.35\nper barrel, or\n26.5%\nhigher, in the year ended\nDecember 31, 2015\n, as compared to the same period in\n2014\n. However, the WTI\/Dated Brent differential was\n$1.81\nlower in the year ended\nDecember 31, 2015\n, as compared to the same period in\n2014\n, and the WTI\/Bakken differential was\n$2.58\nper barrel less favorable for the same periods. The Dated Brent\/Maya differential was approximately\n$4.63\nper barrel less favorable in the year ended\nDecember 31, 2015\nas compared to the same period in\n2014\n. Additionally, the decrease in the Dated Brent\/Maya crude differential, our proxy for the light\/heavy crude differential, had a negative impact on our East Coast refineries, which can process a large slate of medium and heavy, sour crude oil that is priced at a discount to light, sweet crude oil. However, the lower flat price of crude oil during\n2015\nas compared to\n2014\nresulted in improved margins on certain lower value products we produce.\nOperating Expenses\n\u2014 Operating expenses totaled\n$904.5 million\nfor the year ended\nDecember 31, 2015\ncompared to\n$883.1 million\n, or\n$5.34\nper barrel of throughput, for the year ended\nDecember 31, 2014\n, an\nincrease\nof\n$21.4 million\n, or\n2.4%\n. Of the total\n$904.5 million\nof operating expenses, approximately\n$889.4 million\n, or\n$4.72\nper barrel of throughput, related to expenses incurred by the Refining segment, while the remaining\n$15.1\nmillion related to expenses incurred by the Logistics segment. The\nincrease\nin operating expenses is mainly attributable to an increase of approximately\n$45.8\nmillion in maintenance cost primarily driven by the Chalmette Acquisition in 2015 and general repairs at the Delaware City and Paulsboro refineries, an increase\n$17.3\nmillion in employee compensation primarily driven by additional headcount and\n$14.9\nmillion of increased catalyst and chemicals costs partially offset by reduced energy costs of\n$64.4\nmillion due to lower natural gas prices. Although operating expenses increased on an overall basis, refinery operating expenses per barrel decreased as a result of higher throughput volumes. Our operating expenses principally consist of salaries and employee benefits, maintenance, energy and catalyst and chemicals costs at our refineries. The operating expenses related to the Logistics segment consist of costs related to the operation and maintenance of PBFX's assets subsequent to the PBFX Offering and asset acquisitions from PBF Energy.\nGeneral and Administrative Expenses\u2014\nGeneral and administrative expenses totaled\n$181.3 million\nfor the year ended\nDecember 31, 2015\n, compared to\n$146.7 million\nfor the year ended\nDecember 31, 2014\n,\nan increase\nof\n$34.6 million\nor\n23.6%\n. The increase in general and administrative expenses primarily relates to higher employee compensation expense of\n$13.3\nmillion, mainly related to higher headcount and incentive compensation, higher equity compensation expense of\n$4.4\nmillion, higher outside services fees of\n$3.0\nmillion related to professional, legal and engineering consultants attributable to the Chalmette Acquisition and higher expenses associated with PBFX. Our general and administrative expenses are comprised of the personnel, facilities and other infrastructure costs necessary to support our refineries.\n76\nGain on Sale of Assets\n\u2014 Gain on sale of assets for the year ended\nDecember 31, 2015\nwas\n$1.0 million\nwhich related to the sale of railcars which were subsequently leased back to us, compared to a gain of\n$0.9 million\nfor the year ended\nDecember 31, 2014\n, for the sale of railcars.\nDepreciation and Amortization Expense\n\u2014 Depreciation and amortization expense totaled\n$197.4 million\nfor the year ended\nDecember 31, 2015\n, compared to\n$180.4 million\nfor the year ended\nDecember 31, 2014\n, an\nincrease\nof\n$17.0 million\n. The\nincrease\nwas largely driven by our increased fixed asset base due to capital projects and turnarounds completed during 2014 and 2015 as well as the acquisition of the Chalmette refinery in 2015. These general increases were partially offset by reduction in impairment charges. In 2014, we recorded a\n$28.5\nmillion impairment related to an abandoned capital project at our Delaware City refinery during the year whereas we did not record any significant impairment charges in the year ended\nDecember 31, 2015.\nChange in Tax Receivable Agreement Liability\n\u2014\nChange in the tax receivable agreement liability for the year ended\nDecember 31, 2015\nrepresented a gain of\n$18.2 million\nas compared to a gain of\n$3.0 million\nfor the year ended\nDecember 31, 2014.\nChange in Fair Value of Catalyst Leases\n\u2014 Change in the fair value of catalyst leases represented a gain of\n$10.2 million\nfor the year ended\nDecember 31, 2015\n, compared to a gain of\n$4.0 million\nfor the year ended\nDecember 31, 2014\n. These gains relate to the change in value of the precious metals underlying the sale and leaseback of our refineries\u2019 precious metals catalyst, which we are obligated to return or repurchase at fair market value on the lease termination dates.\nInterest Expense, net\u2014\nInterest expense totaled\n$106.2 million\nfor the year ended\nDecember 31, 2015\n, compared to\n$98.8 million\nfor the year ended\nDecember 31, 2014\n,\nan increase\nof\n$7.4 million\n. This increase is mainly attributable to higher interest costs associated with the issuance of the PBFX Senior Notes in May 2015, partially offset by the termination of our crude and feedstock supply agreement with MSCG, effective July 31, 2014. Interest expense includes interest on long-term debt including the Senior Secured Notes, the PBFX Senior Notes and credit facilities, costs related to the sale and leaseback of our precious metals catalyst, interest expense incurred in connection with our crude and feedstock supply agreement with Statoil up to its expiration on December 31, 2015, financing costs associated with the Inventory Intermediation Agreements with J. Aron, letter of credit fees associated with the purchase of certain crude oils, and the amortization of deferred financing costs.\nIncome Tax Expense\u2014\nPBF LLC is organized as a limited liability company and PBFX is a master limited partnership, both of which are treated as \"flow-through\" entities for federal income tax purposes and therefore are not subject to income tax. However, the members of PBF LLC are required to include their proportionate share of PBF LLC\u2019s taxable income or loss, which includes PBF LLC\u2019s allocable share of PBFX\u2019s pre-tax income or loss, on their respective tax returns. PBF LLC generally makes distributions to its members, per the terms of the PBF LLC amended and restated limited liability company agreement, related to such taxes on a pro-rata basis. PBF Energy recognizes an income tax expense or benefit in our consolidated financial statements based on PBF Energy's allocable share of PBF LLC\u2019s pre-tax income or loss, which was approximately\n94.0%\nand\n77.9%\n, on a weighted-average basis for the years ended\nDecember 31, 2015\nand\n2014\n, respectively. PBF Energy's consolidated financial statements do not reflect any benefit or provision for income taxes on the pre-tax income or loss attributable to the noncontrolling interests in PBF LLC or PBFX (although, as described above, PBF LLC must make tax distributions to all its members on a pro-rata basis). PBF Energy's effective tax rate, excluding the impact of noncontrolling interest, for the years ended\nDecember 31, 2015\nand\n2014\nwas\n30.7%\nand\n(40.1)%\n, respectively, reflecting tax benefit adjustments for discrete items related to changes in income tax provision estimates based on our income tax returns and changes in our effective state tax rates. The fluctuation in the effective tax rate is driven by the Company having increased operating income in foreign tax jurisdictions and a change in the effective tax rate calculations due to the Chalmette Acquisition on November 1, 2015, each of which was impacted by the non-cash LCM charge.\nNoncontrolling Interests\u2014\nPBF Energy is the sole managing member of, and has a controlling interest in, PBF LLC. As the sole managing member of PBF LLC, PBF Energy operates and controls all of the business and affairs of PBF LLC and its subsidiaries. PBF Energy consolidates the financial results of PBF LLC and its subsidiaries, including PBFX and PBF Holding. With respect to the consolidation of PBF LLC, the Company records a noncontrolling interest for the economic interest in PBF LLC held by members other than PBF Energy, with respect to the consolidation of PBFX, the Company records a noncontrolling interest for the economic interests in PBFX held by the public unit holders of PBFX, and with respect to the consolidation of PBF Holding, the Company records a\n20%\nnoncontrolling interest for the ownership interest in two subsidiaries of Chalmette Refining held by a third party. The total noncontrolling interest on the consolidated statement of operations represents the portion of the Company\u2019s earnings or loss attributable to the economic interests held by members of PBF LLC other than PBF Energy, by the public common unit holders of PBFX and by the third party holder of Chalmette Refining's subsidiaries. The total noncontrolling interest on the balance sheet represents the portion\n77\nof the Company\u2019s net assets attributable to the economic interests held by the members of PBF LLC other than PBF Energy, by the public common unit holders of PBFX and by the third party holder of Chalmette Refining's subsidiaries. PBF Energy's weighted-average equity noncontrolling interest ownership percentage in PBF LLC for years ended\nDecember 31, 2015\nand\n2014\nwas approximately\n6.0%\nand\n22.1%\n, respectively. The carrying amount of the noncontrolling interest on our consolidated balance sheet attributable to the noncontrolling interest is not equal to the noncontrolling interest ownership percentage due to the effect of income taxes and related agreements that pertain solely to PBF Energy.\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures\nManagement uses certain financial measures to evaluate our operating performance that are calculated and presented on the basis of methodologies other than in accordance with GAAP (\"non-GAAP\"). These measures should not be considered a substitute for, or superior to, measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP, and our calculations thereof may not be comparable to similarly entitled measures reported by other companies.\nSpecial Items\nThe non-GAAP measures presented include Adjusted Fully-Converted net income excluding special items, EBITDA excluding special items, and gross refining margin excluding special items. The special items for the periods presented relate to an LCM adjustment and changes in the tax receivable agreement liability. LCM is a GAAP guideline related to inventory valuation that requires inventory to be stated at the lower of cost or market. Our inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market. Cost is determined by the last-in, first-out (\u201cLIFO\u201d) inventory valuation methodology, in which the most recently incurred costs are charged to cost of sales and inventories are valued at base layer acquisition costs. Market is determined based on an assessment of the current estimated replacement cost and net realizable selling price of the inventory. In periods where the market price of our inventory declines substantially, cost values of inventory may exceed market values. In such instances, we record an adjustment to write down the value of inventory to market value in accordance with GAAP. In subsequent periods, the value of inventory is reassessed and a LCM adjustment is recorded to reflect the net change in the LCM inventory reserve between the prior period and the current period. Changes in the tax receivable agreement liability reflect charges or benefits attributable to changes in our obligation under the tax receivable agreement due to factors out of our control such as changes in tax rates. Although we believe that non-GAAP financial measures, excluding the impact of special items, provide useful supplemental information to investors regarding the results and performance of our business and allow for helpful period-over-period comparisons, such non-GAAP measures should only be considered as a supplement to, and not as a substitute for, or superior to, the financial measures prepared in accordance with GAAP.\nAdjusted Fully-Converted Net Income (Loss)\nPBF Energy utilizes results presented on an Adjusted Fully-Converted basis that reflects an assumed exchange of all PBF LLC Series A Units for shares of Class A common stock of PBF Energy. We believe that these Adjusted Fully-Converted measures, when presented in conjunction with comparable GAAP measures, are useful to investors to compare PBF Energy results across different periods and to facilitate an understanding of our operating results. Adjusted Fully-Converted Net Income (loss) should not be considered an alternative to net income (loss) presented in accordance with GAAP. Adjusted Fully-Converted Net Income (loss) presented by other companies may not be comparable to our presentation, since each company may define this term differently. The differences between Adjusted Fully-Converted and GAAP results are as follows.\n1\nAssumed exchange of all PBF LLC Series A Units for shares of PBF Energy Class A common stock\n. As a result of the assumed exchange of all PBF LLC Series A Units, the noncontrolling interest related to these units is converted to controlling interest. Management believes that it is useful to provide the per-share effect associated with the assumed exchange of all PBF LLC Series A Units.\n2\nIncome Taxes\n. Prior to PBF Energy's IPO, we were organized as a limited liability company treated as a \u201cflow-through\u201d entity for income tax purposes, and even after PBF Energy's IPO, not all of our earnings are subject to corporate-level income taxes. Adjustments have been made to the Adjusted Fully-Converted tax provisions and earnings to assume that we had adopted our post-IPO corporate tax structure for all periods presented and are taxed as a C corporation in the U.S. at the prevailing corporate rates. These assumptions are consistent with the assumption in clause 1 above that all PBF LLC Series A Units are exchanged for shares of PBF Energy Class A common stock, as the assumed exchange would change the amount of our earnings that is subject to corporate income tax.\n78\nThe following table reconciles our Adjusted Fully-Converted results with our results presented in accordance with GAAP for the years ended\nDecember 31, 2016\n,\n2015\nand\n2014\n.\nYear Ended December 31,\n2016\n2015\n2014\nNet income (loss) attributable to PBF Energy Inc. stockholders\n$170,811\n$146,401\n$(38,237\n)\nAdd: Net income attributable to the\nnoncontrolling interest\n(1)\n14,903\n14,257\n101,768\nLess: Income tax (expense) benefit\n(2)\n(5,821\n)\n(5,646\n)\n(40,911\n)\nAdjusted fully-converted net income\n$179,893\n$155,012\n$22,620\nSpecial Items.\nAdd: Non-cash LCM inventory adjustment\n(3)\n(521,348\n)\n427,226\n690,110\nAdd: Change in tax receivable agreement liability\n(3)\n(12,908\n)\n(18,150\n)\n(2,990\n)\nLess: Recomputed income taxes on special item\n(3)\n208,686\n(161,994\n)\n(276,222\n)\nAdjusted fully-converted net (loss) income excluding special items\n$(145,677\n)\n$402,094\n$433,518\nWeighted-average shares outstanding of PBF Energy Inc.\n98,334,302\n88,106,999\n74,464,494\nConversion of PBF LLC Series A Units\n(5)\n4,865,133\n5,530,568\n21,249,314\nCommon stock equivalents\n(4)\n407,274\n501,283\n517,638\nAdjusted fully-converted shares outstanding\u2014diluted\n103,606,709\n94,138,850\n96,231,446\nDiluted net income (loss) per share\n$1.74\n$1.65\n$(0.51\n)\nAdjusted fully-converted net income (per fully exchanged, fully diluted shares outstanding)\n$1.74\n$1.65\n$0.24\nAdjusted fully-converted net (loss) income excluding special items (per fully exchanged, fully diluted shares outstanding)\n$(1.41\n)\n$4.27\n$4.50\n(1)\nRepresents the elimination of the noncontrolling interest associated with the ownership by the members of PBF LLC other than PBF Energy as if such members had fully exchanged their PBF LLC Series A Units for shares of PBF Energy's Class A common stock.\n(2)\nRepresents an adjustment to apply PBF Energy's statutory tax rate of approximately 39.1%, 39.6% and 40.2% for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively, to the noncontrolling interest. The adjustment assumes the full exchange of existing PBF LLC Series A Units as described in (1) above.\n(3)\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2016, we recorded an adjustment to value our inventories to the lower of cost or market which resulted in a net pre-tax benefit of $521.3 million reflecting the change in the lower of cost or market inventory reserve from $1,117.3 million at December 31, 2015 to $596.0 million at December 31, 2016. During the year December 31, 2015, we recorded an adjustment to value our inventory to the lower of cost or market which resulted in a net pre-tax charge of $427.2 million reflecting the change in the lower of cost or market inventory reserve from $690.1 million at December 31, 2014 to $1,117.3 million at December 31, 2015. During the year December 31, 2014, we recorded an adjustment to value our inventory to the lower of cost or market which resulted in a net pre-tax charge of $690.1 million.The net impact of these LCM inventory adjustments are included in the Refining segment's operating income, but are excluded from the operating results presented in the table in order to make such information comparable between periods.\nWe also recorded pre-tax adjustments related to the change in the tax receivable agreement liability of $12.9 million, $18.2 million and $3.0 for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively.\nIncome taxes related to the net LCM adjustment and the change in tax receivable agreement liability were recalculated using our statutory corporate tax rate of approximately 39.1%, 39.6% and 40.2% for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively.\n(4)\nRepresents weighted-average diluted shares outstanding assuming the conversion of all common stock equivalents, including options and warrants for PBF LLC Series A Units and options for shares of PBF Energy Class A common stock as calculated under the treasury stock method for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014. Common stock equivalents exclude the effects of options to purchase 5,701,750, 2,943,750 and 2,401,875 shares of PBF Energy's Class A common stock because they are anti-dilutive for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively.\n(5)\nRepresents an adjustment to weighted-average diluted shares to assume the full exchange of existing PBF LLC Series A Units and common stock equivalents as described in (1) above.\n79\nGross Refining Margin\nGross refining margin is defined as gross margin excluding refinery depreciation, refinery operating expenses, and gross margin of PBFX. We believe gross refining margin is an important measure of operating performance and provides useful information to investors because it is a helpful metric comparison to the industry refining margin benchmarks, as the refining margin benchmarks do not include a charge for refinery operating expenses and depreciation. In order to assess our operating performance, we compare our gross refining margin (revenue less cost of sales) to industry refining margin benchmarks and crude oil prices as defined in the table below.\nGross refining margin should not be considered an alternative to gross margin, operating income, net cash flows from operating activities or any other measure of financial performance or liquidity presented in accordance with GAAP. Gross refining margin presented by other companies may not be comparable to our presentation, since each company may define this term differently. The following table presents a reconciliation of gross refining margin to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure, gross margin, on a historical basis, as applicable, for each of the periods indicated.\nYear Ended December 31,\n2016\n2015\n2014\n$per barrel of throughput\n$per barrel of throughput\n$per barrel of throughput\nReconciliation of gross margin to gross refining margin.\nGross margin\n$727,496\n$2.73\n$571,524\n$3.03\n$308,399\n$1.86\nLess: Revenues of PBFX\n(187,335\n)\n(0.70\n)\n(138,719\n)\n(0.74\n)\n(49,830\n)\n(0.30\n)\nAdd: Affiliate Cost of sales of PBFX\n8,701\n0.03\n8,734\n0.05\n6,979\n0.04\nAdd: Refinery operating expenses\n1,390,582\n5.22\n889,368\n4.72\n883,140\n5.34\nAdd: Refinery depreciation expense\n204,005\n0.77\n181,423\n0.96\n165,413\n1.00\nGross refining margin\n$2,143,449\n$8.05\n$1,512,330\n$8.02\n$1,314,101\n$7.94\nSpecial Items.\nAdd: Non-cash LCM inventory adjustment\n(1)\n(521,348\n)\n(1.96\n)\n427,226\n2.27\n690,110\n4.17\nGross refining margin excluding special items\n$1,622,101\n$6.09\n$1,939,556\n$10.29\n$2,004,211\n$12.11\n(1) During the year ended December 31, 2016, we recorded an adjustment to value our inventories to the lower of cost or market which resulted in a net pre-tax benefit of $521.3 million reflecting the change in the lower of cost or market inventory reserve from $1,117.3 million at December 31, 2015 to $596.0 million at December 31, 2016. During the year ended December 31, 2015, we recorded an adjustment to value our inventories to the lower of cost or market which resulted in a net pre-tax charge of $427.2 million reflecting the change in the lower of cost or market inventory reserve from $690.1 million at December 31, 2014 to $1,117.3 million at December 31, 2015. During the year ended December 31, 2014, we recorded an adjustment to value our inventory to the lower of cost or market which resulted in a net pre-tax charge of $690.1 million. The net impact of these LCM inventory adjustments are included in the Refining segment's operating income, but are excluded from the operating results presented in the table in order to make such information comparable between periods.\nEBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA\nOur management uses EBITDA (earnings before interest, income taxes, depreciation and amortization) and Adjusted EBITDA as measures of operating performance to assist in comparing performance from period to period on a consistent basis and to readily view operating trends, as a measure for planning and forecasting overall expectations and for evaluating actual results against such expectations, and in communications with our board of directors, creditors, analysts and investors concerning our financial performance. Our outstanding indebtedness for borrowed money and other contractual obligations also include similar measures as a basis for certain covenants under those agreements which may differ from the Adjusted EBITDA definition described below.\nEBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA are not presentations made in accordance with GAAP and our computation of EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA may vary from others in our industry. In addition, Adjusted EBITDA contains some, but not all, adjustments that are taken into account in the calculation of the components of various covenants in the agreements\n80\ngoverning the Senior Secured Notes and other credit facilities. EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA should not be considered as alternatives to operating income (loss) or net income (loss) as measures of operating performance. In addition, EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA are not presented as, and should not be considered, an alternative to cash flows from operations as a measure of liquidity. Adjusted EBITDA is defined as EBITDA before adjustments for items such as equity-based compensation expense, gains (losses) from certain derivative activities and contingent consideration, the non-cash change in the deferral of gross profit related to the sale of certain finished products, the write down of inventory to the LCM, changes in the liability for tax receivable agreement due to factors out of our control such as changes in tax rates and certain other non-cash items. Other companies, including other companies in our industry, may calculate EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA differently than we do, limiting their usefulness as comparative measures. EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA also have limitations as analytical tools and should not be considered in isolation, or as a substitute for analysis of our results as reported under GAAP. Some of these limitations include that EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA.\n\u2022\ndoes not reflect depreciation expense or our cash expenditures, or future requirements, for capital expenditures or contractual commitments;\n\u2022\ndoes not reflect changes in, or cash requirements for, our working capital needs;\n\u2022\ndoes not reflect our interest expense, or the cash requirements necessary to service interest or principal payments, on our debt;\n\u2022\ndoes not reflect realized and unrealized gains and losses from certain hedging activities, which may have a substantial impact on our cash flow;\n\u2022\ndoes not reflect certain other non-cash income and expenses; and\n\u2022\nexcludes income taxes that may represent a reduction in available cash.\nThe following tables reconcile net income as reflected in our results of operations to EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA for the periods presented.\nYear Ended December 31,\n2016\n2015\n2014\nReconciliation of net income to EBITDA.\nNet income\n$225,518\n$195,533\n$78,271\nAdd: Depreciation and amortization expense\n222,176\n197,417\n180,382\nAdd: Interest expense, net\n150,045\n106,187\n98,764\nAdd: Income tax expense (benefit)\n137,650\n86,725\n(22,412\n)\nEBITDA\n$735,389\n$585,862\n$335,005\nSpecial Items.\nAdd: Non-cash LCM inventory adjustment\n(1)\n(521,348\n)\n427,226\n690,110\nAdd: Change in tax receivable agreement liability\n(12,908\n)\n(18,150\n)\n(2,990\n)\nEBITDA excluding special items\n$201,133\n994,938\n1,022,125\nReconciliation of EBITDA to Adjusted EBITDA.\nEBITDA\n$735,389\n$585,862\n$335,005\nAdd: Stock based compensation\n22,656\n13,497\n7,181\nAdd: Change in tax receivable agreement liability\n(12,908\n)\n(18,150\n)\n(2,990\n)\nAdd: Non-cash change in fair value of catalyst lease obligations\n(1,422\n)\n(10,184\n)\n(3,969\n)\nAdd: Non-cash LCM inventory adjustment\n(1)\n(521,348\n)\n427,226\n690,110\nAdjusted EBITDA\n$222,367\n$998,251\n$1,025,337\n(1) During the year ended December 31, 2016, we recorded an adjustment to value our inventories to the lower of cost or market which resulted in a net pre-tax benefit of $521.3 million reflecting the change in the lower of cost or market inventory reserve from $1,117.3 million at December 31, 2015 to $596.0 million at December 31, 2016. During the year ended December 31, 2015, we recorded an adjustment to value our inventories to the lower of cost or market which resulted in a net pre-tax charge of $427.2 million reflecting the change in the lower of cost or market inventory reserve from $690.1 million at December 31, 2014 to $1,117.3 million at December 31, 2015. During the year ended December 31, 2014, we\n81\nrecorded an adjustment to value our inventory to the lower of cost or market which resulted in a net pre-tax charge of $690.1 million. The net impact of these LCM inventory adjustments are included in the Refining segment's operating income, but are excluded from the operating results presented in the table in order to make such information comparable between periods.\n82\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nOverview\nOur primary sources of liquidity are our cash flows from operations and borrowing availability under our credit facilities, as more fully described below. We believe that our cash flows from operations and available capital resources will be sufficient to meet our and our subsidiaries capital expenditure, working capital, dividend payments, debt service and share repurchase program requirements, as well as our obligations under the tax receivable agreement, for the next twelve months. On July 1, 2016, we closed the Torrance Acquisition with a combination of cash on hand, including proceeds from our October 2015 Equity Offering and our 2023 Senior Secured Notes Offering, and borrowings under our Revolving Loan. However, our ability to generate sufficient cash flow from operations depends, in part, on petroleum oil market pricing and general economic, political and other factors beyond our control. We are in compliance as of\nDecember 31, 2016\nwith all of the covenants, including financial covenants, in all of our debt agreements.\nCash Flow Analysis\nCash Flows from Operating Activities\nNet cash\nprovided by\noperating activities was\n$651.9 million\nfor the\nyear\nended\nDecember 31, 2016\ncompared to net cash provided by operating activities of\n$560.4 million\nfor the\nyear\nended\nDecember 31, 2015\n. Our operating cash flows for the\nyear\nended\nDecember 31, 2016\nincluded our net income of\n$225.5 million\n, depreciation and amortization of\n$232.9 million\n, deferred income tax expense of\n$244.8 million\n, the change in the fair value of our inventory repurchase obligations of\n$29.5 million\n, pension and other post-retirement benefits costs of\n$38.0 million\n, stock-based compensation of\n$22.7 million\nand a loss on the sale of assets of\n$11.4 million\n, partially offset by net non-cash benefits relating to an LCM adjustment of\n$521.3 million\n, change in the tax receivable agreement liability of\n$12.9 million\nand changes in the fair value of our catalyst lease of\n$1.4 million\n. In addition, net changes in working capital reflected sources of cash of approximately\n$382.9 million\ndriven by the timing of inventory purchases, payments for accrued expenses and accounts payable and collections of accounts receivable. Our operating cash flows for the year ended\nDecember 31, 2015\nincluded our net income of\n$195.5 million\n, plus net non-cash charges relating to an LCM adjustment of\n$427.2 million\n, depreciation and amortization of\n$207.0 million\n, the change in the fair value of our inventory repurchase obligations of\n$63.4 million\n, pension and other post-retirement benefits of\n$27.0 million\n, and equity-based compensation of\n$13.5 million\n, partially offset by change in deferred income taxes of\n$5.6 million\n, changes in the fair value of our catalyst lease of\n$10.2 million\n, change in the tax receivable agreement liability of\n$18.2 million\n, and a gain on the sale of assets of\n$1.0 million\n.

The PBF Rail Term Loan amortizes monthly over its five year term and bears interest at the one month LIBOR plus 2.0%. As security for the PBF Rail Term Loan, PBF Rail pledged, among other things: (i) certain eligible railcars; (ii) the Debt Service Reserve Account; and (iii) PBF Holding's member interest in PBF Rail. Additionally, the PBF Rail Term Loan contains customary terms, events of default and covenants for transactions of this nature. PBF Rail may at any time repay the PBF Rail Term Loan without penalty in the event that railcars collateralizing the loan are sold, scrapped or otherwise removed from the collateral pool.\nThe 7.00% Senior Secured Notes due 2023 (the \"2023 Senior Secured Notes\") were issued on November 24, 2015 and included a registration payment arrangement whereby we agreed to use commercially reasonable efforts to consummate an offer to exchange the 2023 Senior Secured Notes for an issue of registered notes with terms substantially identical to the notes not later than 365 days after the date of the original issuance of the notes. This registration statement was declared effective on December 1, 2016 and the exchange was consummated on January 19, 2017. Because the exchange offer was not consummated by November 24, 2016, additional interest was added at a rate of 0.25% per annum for the period from November 24, 2016 through the consummation of the exchange. As a result, we recognized approximately $0.1 million of additional interest expense in 2016.\nDuring 2016, PBF Holding borrowed under its Revolving Loan to partially fund the Torrance Acquisition (as discussed in \"Note 4 - Acquisitions\"). Additionally, during 2016, PBFX borowed under the PBFX Revolving Credit\n85\nAgreement to partially fund the PBFX Plains Asset Purchase (as discussed in \"Note 4 - Acquisitions\") and its acquisition of TVPC (as discussed in \"Note 3- PBF Logistics LP\").\nRevolving Credit Facilities Overview\nOur primary sources of liquidity are cash flows from operations with additional sources available under borrowing capacity from our revolving lines of credit. As of December 31,\n2016\n, we had\n$746.3 million\nof cash and cash equivalents,\n$350.0 million\noutstanding under the PBF Holding Revolving Loan and\n$189.2 million\noutstanding under the PBFX Revolving Credit Facility. We believe available capital resources will be adequate to meet our capital expenditure, working capital and debt service requirements. We had available capacity under revolving credit facilities as follows at\nDecember 31, 2016\n(in millions).\nTotal Capacity\nAmount Borrowed as of December 31, 2016\nOutstanding Letters of Credit\nAvailable Capacity\nExpiration date\nPBF Holding Revolving Loan (a)\n$2,635.0\n$350.0\n$412.0\n$534.6\nAugust 2019\nPBFX Revolving Credit Facility\n360.0\n189.2\n3.6\n$167.2\nMay 2019\nTotal Credit Facilities\n$2,995.0\n$539.2\n$415.6\n$701.8\n(a)\nThe amount available for borrowings and letters of credit under the Revolving Loan is calculated according to a \u201cborrowing base\u201d formula based on (i) 90% of the book value of eligible accounts receivable with respect to investment grade obligors plus (ii) 85% of the book value of eligible accounts receivable with respect to non-investment grade obligors plus (iii) 80% of the cost of eligible hydrocarbon inventory plus (iv) 100% of cash and cash equivalents in deposit accounts subject to a control agreement. The borrowing base is subject to customary reserves and eligibility criteria and in any event cannot exceed $2.635 billion.\nAdditional Information on Indebtedness\nOur debt, including our revolving credit facilities, term loans and senior notes, include certain typical financial covenants and restrictions on our subsidiaries' ability to, among other things, incur or guarantee new debt, engage in certain business activities including transactions with affiliates and asset sales, make investments or distributions, engage in mergers or pay dividends in certain circumstances. These covenants are subject to a number of important exceptions and qualifications. For further discussion of our indebtedness and these covenants and restrictions, see \"Note 10 - Credit Facilities and Long Term Debt\" in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in this annual report.\nPBF Holding and PBFX are in compliance with their respective covenants as of\nDecember 31, 2016.\nCash Balances\nAs of\nDecember 31, 2016\n, our cash and cash equivalents totaled\n$746.3\nmillion.\nLiquidity\nAs of\nDecember 31, 2016\n, our total liquidity was approximately\n$1,280.9 million\n, compared to total liquidity of approximately\n$1,544.1 million\nas of\nDecember 31, 2015\n. Total liquidity is the sum of our cash and cash equivalents plus the estimated amount of availability under the Revolving Loan. In addition, as of\nDecember 31, 2016\n, PBFX had approximately\n$167.2 million\nof borrowing capacity under the PBFX Revolving Credit Facility which is available to fund working capital, acquisitions, distributions and capital expenditures and for other general corporate purposes.\nShare Repurchases\nOur Board of Directors has authorized the repurchase of up to\n$300.0\nmillion of our Class A common stock, which expires on September 30, 2018. As of\nDecember 31, 2016\nwe have purchased approximately\n6.05 million\nshares of the Company's Class A common stock under the Repurchase Program for\n$150.8\nmillion through open market transactions. No repurchases of our Class A common stock were made during the year ended\nDecember 31, 2016\n. We currently have the ability to purchase approximately an additional\n$149.2\nmillion in common stock under the approved Repurchased Program.\nThese repurchases may be made from time to time through various methods, including open market transactions, block trades, accelerated share repurchases, privately negotiated transactions or otherwise, certain of which may be effected through Rule 10b5-1 and Rule 10b-18 plans. The timing and number of shares repurchased will depend on a variety of factors, including price, capital availability, legal requirements and economic and market conditions. We are not obligated to purchase any shares under the Repurchase Program, and repurchases may be suspended or discontinued at any time without prior notice.\n86\nWorking Capital\nWorking capital for PBF Energy at\nDecember 31, 2016\nwas\n$1,350.7 million\n, consisting of\n$3,407.3 million\nin total current assets and\n$2,056.5 million\nin total current liabilities. Working capital at\nDecember 31, 2015\nwas\n$1,526.5 million\n, consisting of\n$3,022.0 million\nin total current assets and\n$1,495.5 million\nin total current liabilities.\nCrude and Feedstock Supply Agreements\nWe have acquired crude oil for our Paulsboro and Delaware City refineries under supply agreements whereby Statoil generally purchased the crude oil requirements for each refinery on our behalf and under our direction. Our agreements with Statoil for Paulsboro and Delaware City were terminated effective March 31, 2013 and December 31, 2015, respectively, at which time we began to source Paulsboro\u2019s and Delaware City's crude oil and feedstocks independently. Additionally, for our purchases of crude oil under our agreement with Saudi Aramco, similar to our purchases of other foreign waterborne crudes, we posted letters of credit and arranged for shipment. We paid for the crude when we were invoiced and the letters of credit were lifted.\nWe had a similar supply agreement with MSCG, which was terminated effective July 31, 2014, to supply the crude oil requirements for our Toledo refinery, under which we took title to MSCG\u2019s crude oil at certain interstate pipeline delivery locations. Payment for the crude oil under the Toledo supply agreement was due three days after it was processed by us or sold to third parties. We did not have to post letters of credit for these purchases and the Toledo supply agreement allowed us to price and pay for our crude oil as it was processed, which reduced the time we were exposed to market fluctuations. We recorded an accrued liability at each period-end for the amount we owed MSCG for the crude oil that we owned but had not processed. Subsequent to the term of the MSCG supply agreement, we have sourced all our Toledo crude oil needs independently, which has increased the volumes of crude oil we own.\nWe have crude and feedstock supply agreements with PDVSA to supply 40,000 to 60,000 bpd of crude oil that can be processed at any of our East and Gulf Coast refineries.\nIn connection with the closing of the Torrance Acquisition, we entered into a crude supply agreement with ExxonMobil for approximately 60,000 bpd of crude oil that can be processed at our Torrance refinery.\nInventory Intermediation Agreements\nWe entered into two separate Inventory Intermediation Agreements with J. Aron, which were amended and restated on May 29, 2015, expiring two years from the original expiry date of July 1, 2015, subject to certain early termination rights. In addition, the A&R Intermediation Agreements include one-year renewal clauses by mutual consent of both parties.\nPursuant to each A&R Intermediation Agreement, J. Aron will continue to purchase and hold title to certain of the intermediate and finished products produced by the Paulsboro and Delaware City refineries, respectively, and delivered into tanks at the refineries. Furthermore, J. Aron agrees to sell the Products back to Paulsboro refinery and Delaware City refinery as the Products are discharged out of the Refineries' tanks. J. Aron has the right to store the Products purchased in tanks under the A&R Intermediation Agreements and will retain these storage rights for the term of the agreements. PBF Holding will continue to market and sell independently to third parties. The A&R Intermediation Agreements for both the Delaware City and Paulsboro refineries with J. Aron include one-year renewal clauses upon six months' advance notice by mutual consent of both parties. The A&R Intermediation Agreements have not been renewed and are scheduled to expire July 1, 2017. If we are unable to negotiate an extension with J. Aron or enter into an alternative intermediation agreement, we will have to repurchase the inventories outstanding under the A&R Intermediation Agreement at that time.\nAt\nDecember 31, 2016\n, the LIFO value of intermediates and finished products owned by J. Aron included within inventory on our balance sheet was\n$352.5 million\n. We accrue a corresponding liability for such intermediates and finished products.\nCapital Spending\nNet capital spending was\n$1,588.2 million\nfor the\nyear\nended\nDecember 31, 2016\n, which primarily included turnaround costs, safety related enhancements, facility improvements at the refineries, the Torrance Acquisition, the PBFX Plains Asset Purchase and the final working capital settlement associated with the Chalmette Acquisition. We currently expect to spend an aggregate of $575.0 to $600.0 million in net capital expenditures during 2017, excluding PBFX, for facility improvements and refinery maintenance and turnarounds. Significant capital spending plans for 2017 include turnarounds for the FCC at our Delaware City refinery, several units at our Torrance refinery and several units at our\n87\nChalmette refinery, as well as expenditures to meet Tier 3 requirements. In addition, PBFX expects to spend an aggregate of $75.0 to $100.0 million in net capital expenditures during 2017 primarily on growth projects.\nOn July 1, 2016 we acquired the Torrance refinery and related logistic assets. The purchase price for the Torrance Acquisition was approximately $521.4 million in cash after post-closing purchase price adjustments, plus final working capital of $450.6 million. The purchase price and fair value allocation may be subject to adjustment pending completion of the final valuation which was still in process as of December 31, 2016. The transaction was financed through a combination of cash on hand including proceeds from our October 2015 Equity Offering and borrowings under our Revolving Loan.\nContractual Obligations and Commitments\nThe following table summarizes our material contractual payment obligations as of\nDecember 31, 2016\n. The table below does not include any contractual obligations with PBFX as these related party transactions are eliminated upon consolidation of our financial statements.\nPayments due by period\nTotal\nLess than\n1 year\n1-3 Years\n3-5 Years\nMore than\n5 years\nLong-term debt\n(a)\n$2,185,333\n$49,462\n$575,371\n$710,500\n$850,000\nInterest payments on debt facilities\n(a)\n637,533\n130,020\n253,505\n147,914\n106,094\nOperating Leases\n(b)\n441,921\n111,706\n188,604\n106,052\n35,559\nPurchase obligations\n(c)\n.\nCrude Supply and Inventory Intermediation Agreements\n8,137,912\n2,268,826\n3,560,062\n2,309,024\n\u2014\nOther Supply and Capacity Agreements\n1,269,562\n187,443\n328,399\n195,324\n558,396\nConstruction obligations\n35,149\n35,149\n\u2014\n\u2014\n\u2014\nEnvironmental obligations\n(d)\n161,488\n10,231\n22,537\n10,750\n117,970\nPension and post-retirement obligations\n(e)\n263,723\n13,413\n17,648\n19,012\n213,650\nTax receivable agreement obligations\n(f)\n611,392\n\u2014\n146,615\n79,025\n385,752\nTotal contractual cash obligations\n$13,744,013\n$2,806,250\n$5,092,741\n$3,577,601\n$2,267,421\n(a)    Long-term Debt and Interest Payments on Debt Facilities\nLong-term obligations represent (i) the repayment of the outstanding borrowings under the Revolving Loan; (ii) the repayment of indebtedness incurred in connection with the Senior Secured Notes; (iii) the repayment of our catalyst lease obligations on their maturity dates; (iv) the repayment of outstanding amounts under the PBFX Revolving Credit Facility, the PBFX Term Loan and the PBFX Senior Notes; and (v) the repayment of outstanding amounts under the Rail Term Loan.\nInterest payments on debt facilities include cash interest payments on the Senior Secured Notes, PBFX Term Loan, PBFX Revolving Credit Facility, PBFX Senior Notes, catalyst lease obligations, Rail Term Loan, plus cash payments for the commitment fees on the unused portion on our revolving credit facilities and letter of credit fees on the letters of credit outstanding at\nDecember 31, 2016\n. With the exception of our catalyst leases and outstanding borrowings on the PBFX Term Loan, we have no long-term debt maturing before 2019 as of\nDecember 31, 2016.\n(b)    Operating Leases\nWe enter into operating leases in the normal course of business, some of these leases provide us with the option to renew the lease or purchase the leased item. Future operating lease obligations would change if we chose to exercise renewal options and if we enter into additional operating lease agreements. Certain of our lease obligations contain a fixed and variable component. The table above reflects the fixed component of our lease obligations. The variable component could be significant. Our operating lease obligations are further explained in the Commitments and Contingencies footnote to our financial statements, \u201cItem 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.\u201d In support of our rail strategy, we have at times entered into agreements to lease or purchase crude railcars. A portion of these railcars were purchased via the Rail Facility entered into during 2014, which was repaid in full and terminated in connection with the execution of the PBF Rail Term Loan in 2016. Certain of these railcars were subsequently sold to third parties, which have leased the railcars back to us for periods of between four and seven years.\n88\n(c)    Purchase Obligations\nWe have obligations to repurchase certain intermediates and refined products under separate inventory intermediation agreements with J. Aron as further explained in the Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, Inventories and Accrued Expenses footnotes to our financial statements, \u201cItem 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.\u201d Additionally, purchase obligations under \"Crude Supply and Inventory Intermediation Agreements\" include commitments to purchase crude oil from certain counterparties under supply agreements entered into to ensure adequate supplies of crude oil for our refineries. These obligations are based on aggregate minimum volume commitments at 2016 year end market prices.\nPayments under \"Other Supply and Capacity Agreements\" include contracts for the transportation of crude oil and supply of hydrogen, steam, or natural gas to certain of our refineries, contracts for the treatment of wastewater, and contracts for pipeline capacity. We enter into these contracts to facilitate crude oil deliveries and to ensure an adequate supply of energy or essential services to support our refinery operations. Substantially all of these obligations are based on fixed prices. Certain agreements include fixed or minimum volume requirements, while others are based on our actual usage. The amounts included in this table are based on fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased and the fixed or estimated costs based on market conditions as of\nDecember 31, 2016.\n(d)    Environmental Obligations\nIn connection with the Paulsboro acquisition, we assumed certain environmental remediation obligations to address existing soil and groundwater contamination at the site and recorded a liability in the amount of\n$10.8\nmillion which reflects the present value of the current estimated cost of the remediation obligations assumed based on investigative work to-date. The undiscounted estimated costs related to these environmental remediation obligations were\n$16.7\nmillion as of\nDecember 31, 2016.\nIn connection with the acquisition of the Delaware City assets, the prior owners remain responsible, subject to certain limitations, for certain pre-acquisition environmental obligations, including ongoing soil and groundwater remediation at the site.\nIn connection with the Delaware City assets and Paulsboro refinery acquisitions, we, along with the seller, purchased two individual ten-year, $75.0 million environmental insurance policies to insure against unknown environmental liabilities at each site.\nIn connection with the acquisition of Toledo, the seller initially retains, subject to certain limitations, remediation obligations which will transition to us over a 20-year period.\nIn connection with the acquisition of the Chalmette refinery, the sellers provided $3.9 million financial assurance in the form of a surety bond to cover estimated potential site remediation costs associated with an agreed to Administrative Order of Consent with the EPA. Additionally, we purchased a ten year $100.0 million environmental insurance policy to insure against unknown environmental liabilities at the site.\nIn connection with the PBFX Plains Asset Purchase, PBFX is responsible for the environmental remediation costs for conditions that existed on the closing date up to a maximum of $250 thousand per year for 10 years, with Plains All American Pipeline, L.P. remaining responsible for any and all additional costs above such amounts during such period.\nIn connection with the Torrance Acquisition, we assumed certain environmental remediation obligations to address existing soil and groundwater contamination at the site and recorded a liability of\n$142.5\nmillion as of\nDecember 31, 2016\n, which reflects the current estimated cost of the remediation obligations, expected to be paid out over an average period of approximately 20 years. Additionally, we purchased a ten year $100.0 million environmental insurance policy to insure against unknown environmental liabilities.\nIn connection with the acquisition of all of our refineries, we assumed certain environmental obligations under regulatory orders unique to each site, including orders regulating air emissions from each facility.\n(e)\nPension and Post-retirement Obligations\nPension and post-retirement obligations include only those amounts we expect to pay out in benefit payments and are further explained at the Employee Benefit Plans footnote to our financial statements, \u201cItem 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.\u201d\n89\n(f)\nTax Receivable Agreement Obligations\nWe used a portion of the proceeds from our IPO to purchase PBF LLC Series A Units from the members of PBF LLC other than PBF Energy. In addition, the members of PBF LLC other than PBF Energy may (subject to the terms of the exchange agreement) exchange their PBF LLC Series A Units for shares of Class A common stock of PBF Energy on a one-for-one basis. As a result of both the purchase of PBF LLC Series A Units and subsequent secondary offerings and exchanges, PBF Energy is entitled to a proportionate share of the existing tax basis of the assets of PBF LLC. Such transactions have resulted in increases in the tax basis of the assets of PBF LLC that otherwise would not have been available. Both this proportionate share and these increases in tax basis have reduced the amount of the tax that PBF Energy would have otherwise been required to pay and may reduce the amount of tax that PBF Energy would otherwise be required to pay in the future. These increases in tax basis may also decrease gains (or increase losses) on the future disposition of certain capital assets to the extent tax basis is allocated to those capital assets. We have entered into a tax receivable agreement with the current and former members of PBF LLC other than PBF Energy that provides for the payment by PBF Energy to such members of 85% of the amount of the benefits, if any, that PBF Energy is deemed to realize as a result of (i) these increases in tax basis and (ii) certain other tax benefits related to entering into the tax receivable agreement, including tax benefits attributable to payments under the tax receivable agreement. These payment obligations are obligations of PBF Energy and not of PBF LLC or any of its subsidiaries.\nPBF Energy expects to obtain funding for these payments by causing its subsidiaries to make cash distributions to PBF LLC, which, in turn, will distribute such amounts, generally as tax distributions, on a pro-rata basis to its owners, which as of\nDecember 31, 2016\ninclude the members of PBF LLC other than PBF Energy holding a\n3.5%\ninterest and PBF Energy holding a\n96.5%\ninterest. The members of PBF LLC other than PBF Energy may continue to reduce their ownership in PBF LLC by exchanging their PBF LLC Series A Units for shares of PBF Energy Class A common stock. Such exchanges may result in additional increases in the tax basis of PBF Energy\u2019s investment in PBF LLC and require PBF Energy to make increased payments under the tax receivable agreement. Required payments under the tax receivable agreement also may increase or become accelerated in certain circumstances, including certain changes of control. See \u201cItem 1A. Risk Factors\u2014Risks Related to Our Organizational Structure and Our Class A Common Stock\u2014In certain cases, payments by us under the tax receivable agreement may be accelerated and\/or significantly exceed the actual benefits we realize in respect of the tax attributes subject to the tax receivable agreement. These provisions may deter a change in control of our company.\u201d\nThe table above reflects our estimated timing of payments under the tax receivable agreement assuming no material changes in the relevant tax law, and that we earn sufficient taxable income to realize all tax benefits that are subject to the tax receivable agreement as of\nDecember 31, 2016.\nTax Distributions\nPBF LLC is required to make periodic tax distributions to the members of PBF LLC, including PBF Energy, pro rata in accordance with their respective percentage interests for such period (as determined under the amended and restated limited liability company agreement of PBF LLC), subject to available cash and applicable law and contractual restrictions (including pursuant to our debt instruments) and based on certain assumptions. Generally, these tax distributions will be an amount equal to our estimate of the taxable income of PBF LLC for the year multiplied by an assumed tax rate equal to the highest effective marginal combined U.S. federal, state and local income tax rate prescribed for an individual or corporate resident in New York, New York (taking into account the nondeductibility of certain expenses). If, with respect to any given calendar year, the aggregate periodic tax distributions were less than the actual taxable income of PBF LLC multiplied by the assumed tax rate, PBF LLC will make a \u201ctrue up\u201d tax distribution, no later than March 15 of the following year, equal to such difference, subject to the available cash and borrowings of PBF LLC. As these distributions are conditional they have been excluded from the table above.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nWe have no off-balance sheet arrangements as of\nDecember 31, 2016\n, other than outstanding letters of credit of approximately\n$415.6 million\nand operating leases.\nDuring 2015, in aggregate we sold\n1,122\nof our owned crude railcars and concurrently entered into lease agreements for the same railcars. The lease agreements have varying terms from five to seven years. We received an aggregate cash payment for the railcars of approximately\n$168.3\nmillion and expect to make payments totaling\n$99.4\nmillion over the term of the lease for these railcars. In 2016, we sold approximately 120 of these railcars to optimize our railcar portfolio.\nDuring the year ended\nDecember 31, 2016\n, we had additional railcar leases outstanding with terms of up to 10 years. We expect to make lease payments of\n$18.6\nmillion over the remaining term of these additional agreements.\n90\nCritical Accounting Policies\nThe following summary provides further information about our critical accounting policies that involve critical accounting estimates and should be read in conjunction with Note 2 to our financial statements, \u201cItem 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.\u201d The following accounting policies involve estimates that are considered critical due to the level of subjectivity and judgment involved, as well as the impact on our financial position and results of operations. We believe that all of our estimates are reasonable. Unless otherwise noted, estimates of the sensitivity to earnings that would result from changes in the assumptions used in determining our estimates is not practicable due to the number of assumptions and contingencies involved, and the wide range of possible outcomes.\nInventory\nInventories are carried at the lower of cost or market. The cost of crude oil, feedstocks, blendstocks and refined products is determined under the LIFO method using the dollar value LIFO method with increments valued based on average cost during the year. The cost of supplies and other inventories is determined principally on the weighted average cost method. In addition, the use of the LIFO inventory method may result in increases or decreases to cost of sales in years that inventory volumes decline as the result of charging cost of sales with LIFO inventory costs generated in prior periods. As of December 31, 2016 and 2015, market values had fallen below historical LIFO inventory costs and, as a result, we recorded lower of cost or market inventory valuation reserves of $596.0 million and $1,117.3 million, respectively. The $596.0 million as of December 31, 2016, or a portion thereof, is subject to reversal as a reduction to cost of products sold in subsequent periods as inventories giving rise to the reserve are sold, and a new reserve is established. Such a reduction to cost of products sold could be significant if inventory values return to historical cost price levels. Additionally, further decreases in overall inventory values could result in additional charges to cost of products sold should the lower of cost or market inventory valuation reserve be increased.\nOur Delaware City refinery acquired a portion of its crude oil from Statoil under our crude supply agreement whereby we took title to the crude oil as it was delivered to our processing units. We had risk of loss while the Statoil inventory was in our storage tanks. We were obligated to purchase all of the crude oil held by Statoil on our behalf upon termination of the agreements. As a result of the purchase obligations, we recorded the inventory of crude oil and feedstocks in the refinery\u2019s storage facilities. The purchase obligations contained derivatives that changed in value based on changes in commodity prices. Such changes were included in our cost of sales. Our agreement with Statoil for our Delaware City refinery terminated effective December 31, 2015, at which time we began to source crude oil and feedstocks internally. Our agreement with Statoil for Paulsboro terminated effective March 31, 2013, at which time we began to source crude oil and feedstocks independently.\nPrior to July 31, 2014, our Toledo refinery acquired substantially all of its crude oil from MSCG under a crude oil acquisition agreement whereby we took legal title to the crude oil at certain interstate pipeline delivery locations. We recorded an accrued liability at each period-end for the amount we owed MSCG for the crude oil that we owned but had not processed. The accrued liability was based on the period-end market value, as it represented our best estimate of what we would pay for the crude oil. We terminated this crude oil acquisition agreement effective July 31, 2014 and began to source our crude oil needs independently.\nEnvironmental Matters\nLiabilities for future clean-up costs are recorded when environmental assessments and\/or clean-up efforts are probable and the costs can be reasonably estimated. Other than for assessments, the timing and magnitude of these accruals generally are based on the completion of investigations or other studies or a commitment to a formal plan of action. Environmental liabilities are based on best estimates of probable future costs using currently available technology and applying current regulations, as well as our own internal environmental policies. The actual settlement of our liability for environmental matters could materially differ from our estimates due to a number of uncertainties such as the extent of contamination, changes in environmental laws and regulations, potential improvements in remediation technologies and the participation of other responsible parties. Additionally, in connection with the Torrance Acquisition on July 1, 2016, we assumed certain pre-existing environmental liabilities. While we believe that our current estimates of the amounts and timing of the costs related to the remediation of these liabilities are reasonable, we have had limited experience with these environmental obligations due to our short operating history. It is possible that our estimates of the costs and duration of the environmental remediation activities related to these liabilities could materially change.\nBusiness Combinations\nWe use the acquisition method of accounting for the recognition of assets acquired and liabilities assumed in business combinations at their estimated fair values as of the date of acquisition. Any excess consideration transferred over the\n91\nestimated fair values of the identifiable net assets acquired is recorded as goodwill. Significant judgment is required in estimating the fair value of assets acquired. As a result, in the case of significant acquisitions, we obtain the assistance of third-party valuation specialists in estimating fair values of tangible and intangible assets based on available historical information and on expectations and assumptions about the future, considering the perspective of marketplace participants. While management believes those expectations and assumptions are reasonable, they are inherently uncertain. Unanticipated market or macroeconomic events and circumstances may occur, which could affect the accuracy or validity of the estimates and assumptions.\nDeferred Turnaround Costs\nRefinery turnaround costs, which are incurred in connection with planned major maintenance activities at our refineries, are capitalized when incurred and amortized on a straight-line basis over the period of time estimated until the next turnaround occurs (generally three to five years). While we believe that the estimates of time until the next turnaround are reasonable, it should be noted that factors such as competition, regulation or environmental matters could cause us to change our estimates thus impacting amortization expense in the future.\nDerivative Instruments\nWe are exposed to market risk, primarily related to changes in commodity prices for the crude oil and feedstocks we use in the refining process as well as the prices of the refined products we sell. The accounting treatment for commodity contracts depends on the intended use of the particular contract and on whether or not the contract meets the definition of a derivative. Non-derivative contracts are recorded at the time of delivery.\nAll derivative instruments that are not designated as normal purchases or sales are recorded in our balance sheet as either assets or liabilities measured at their fair values. Changes in the fair value of derivative instruments that either are not designated or do not qualify for hedge accounting treatment or normal purchase or normal sale accounting are recognized in income. Contracts qualifying for the normal purchases and sales exemption are accounted for upon settlement. We elect fair value hedge accounting for certain derivatives associated with our inventory repurchase obligations.\nDerivative accounting is complex and requires management judgment in the following respects: identification of derivatives and embedded derivatives; determination of the fair value of derivatives; identification of hedge relationships; assessment and measurement of hedge ineffectiveness; and election and designation of the normal purchases and sales exception. All of these judgments, depending upon their timing and effect, can have a significant impact on earnings.\nIncome Taxes and Tax Receivable Agreement\nAs PBF LLC is a limited liability company treated as a \u201cflow-through\u201d entity for income tax purposes, there is no benefit or provision for federal or state income tax in the accompanying financial statements for periods prior to the closing of our initial public offering on December 18, 2012. Effective with the completion of our initial public offering, we recognize an income tax expense or benefit in our consolidated financial statements based on our allocable share of PBF LLC\u2019s pre-tax income (loss). We do not recognize any income tax expense or benefit related to the noncontrolling interest in PBF LLC.\nEffective upon the completion of our initial public offering, we provide for deferred income taxes for temporary differences between the financial statement carrying amounts and tax bases of assets and liabilities at each balance sheet date, using enacted tax rates expected to be in effect when the related taxes are expected to be paid or received. A deferred tax asset may be reduced by a valuation allowance when we, after assessing the probability of future taxable income and evaluating alternative tax planning strategies, determine that it is more likely than not that the future tax benefit may not be realized. If future taxable income differs from our estimates or if expected tax planning strategies are not available as anticipated, adjustments to the valuation allowance may be needed. Deferred tax assets and liabilities may be adjusted in the future for the effect of changes in tax laws or rates on the date of enactment.\nPursuant to the tax receivable agreement we entered into at the time of our initial public offering, we are required to pay the current and former PBF LLC Series A Unit holders, who exchange their units for PBF Energy stock or whose units we purchase, approximately 85% of the cash savings in income taxes that we are deemed to realize as a result of the increase in the tax basis of our interest in PBF LLC, including tax benefits attributable to payments made under the tax receivable agreement. These payment obligations are of PBF Energy and not of PBF LLC or any of its subsidiaries. We have recognized a liability for the tax receivable agreement reflecting our estimate of the undiscounted amounts that we expect to pay under the agreement. Our estimate of the tax agreement liability is based, in part, on forecasts of future taxable income over the anticipated life of our future business operations, assuming no material changes in the relevant tax law. The assumptions used in the forecasts are subject to substantial uncertainty about our future business operations\n92\nand the actual payments that we are required to make under the tax receivable agreement could differ materially from our current estimates. We must adjust the estimated tax receivable agreement liability each time we purchase PBF LLC Series A Units or upon an exchange of PBF LLC Series A Units for our Class A common stock. Such adjustments will be based on forecasts of future taxable income and our future business operations at the time of such purchases or exchanges. Periodically, we may adjust the liability based on an updated estimate of the amounts that we expect to pay, using assumptions consistent with those used in our concurrent estimate of the deferred tax asset valuation allowance. These periodic adjustments to the tax receivable liability, if any, are recorded in general and administrative expense and may result in adjustments to our income tax expense and deferred tax assets and liabilities.\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\nIn August 2015, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (\u201cFASB\u201d) issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2015-14, \u201cRevenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606): Deferral of the Effective Date\u201d (\u201cASU 2015-14\u201d), which defers the effective date of ASU 2014-09, \u201cRevenue from Contracts with Customers\u201d (\u201cASU 2014-09\u201d) for all entities by one year. Additional ASUs have been issued in 2016 that provide certain implementation guidance related to ASU 2014-09 (collectively, we refer to ASU 2014-09 and these additional ASUs as the \"Updated Revenue Recognition Guidance\").The Updated Revenue Recognition Guidance will replace most existing revenue recognition guidance in GAAP when it becomes effective. Under ASU 2015-14, this guidance becomes effective for interim and annual periods beginning after December 15, 2017 and permits the use of either the retrospective or modified retrospective transition method. Under ASU 2015-14, early adoption is permitted only as of annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2016, including interim reporting periods within that reporting period. We have established a working group to assess the Updated Revenue Recognition Guidance, including its impact on our business processes, accounting systems, controls and financial statement disclosures. Our preliminary expectation is that we will adopt this guidance using the modified retrospective method whereby a cumulative effect adjustment is recognized upon adoption and the Updated Revenue Recognition Guidance is applied prospectively. It is not anticipated that the Company will early adopt this new guidance. The working group is in the early stages of its implementation plan and continues to evaluate the impact of this new standard on the Company\u2019s consolidated financial statements and related disclosures. Although our analysis of the new standard is still in process and interpretative and industry specific guidance is still developing, we currently do not expect the new standard to have a material impact on the amount or timing of revenues recognized for the majority of our revenue arrangements.\nIn February 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-02, \"Leases (Topic 842)\" (\"ASU 2016-02\"), to increase the transparency and comparability about leases among entities. The new guidance requires lessees to recognize a lease liability and a corresponding lease asset for virtually all lease contracts.  It also requires additional disclosures about leasing arrangements. ASU 2016-02 is effective for interim and annual periods beginning after December 15, 2018, and requires a modified retrospective approach to adoption. Early adoption is permitted. We have established a working group to study the new guidance in ASU 2016-02. This working group was formed during 2016 and has recommended that we adopt this guidance using the modified retrospective. It is not anticipated that we will early adopt this new guidance. The working group continues to evaluate the impact of this new standard on our consolidated financial statements and related disclosures. At this time, we have identified that the most significant impacts of this new guidance will be to bring nearly all leases on our balance sheet with \u201cright of use assets\u201d and \u201clease obligation liabilities\u201d as well as accelerating the interest expense component of financing leases.\nRefer to \"Note 2 - Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\" for additional Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements.","82":"","83":"","84":"ITEM 7.\nMANAGEMENT\u2019S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS\nOF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.\nManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, or MD&A, is intended to provide a reader of our financial statements with a narrative from the perspective of our management on our financial condition, results of operations, liquidity and certain other factors that may affect our future results. The following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with our Consolidated Financial Statements and the related notes included in Item 8 - \"Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\" of this Form 10-K.\nRevenues\nWe generate a substantial portion of our revenues on a per\u2010transaction or subscription basis, which is derived from contracts that extend up to 60 months from execution.\nHistorically, our revenues have been directly impacted by the number of transactions that we process for our customers. The future success of our business depends on the continued growth of consumer and business transactions and, as such, the volume of transactions that we process could fluctuate on a quarterly basis.  See \u201cCurrent Trends Affecting Our Results of Operations\u201d for certain matters regarding future results of operations.\nMost of our revenues are recorded in U.S. dollars but as we continue to expand our business with international customers and increase the extent of recording our international activities in local currencies, we will become subject to currency translation risk that could affect our future reported net sales.\nEach of AT&T and Verizon accounted for more than 10% of our revenues for the years ended December 31,\n2016\nand\n2015\n. AT&T and Verizon in the aggregate accounted for\n62%\nand\n71%\nof our revenues for the years ended December 31,\n2016\nand\n2015\n, respectively.\nAlthough in December 2016, we divested our activation call center business, which included a portion of the services that we historically provided to AT&T, we will continue to generate revenue from AT&T from our activation software and professional services. We have Statements of Work for each of the Verizon and AT&T businesses that we support which typically run for 12 to 36 months. Although Intralinks has a diverse customer base and we expect that revenue from our Intralinks business will comprise a significant portion of our going forward revenue, the loss of either AT&T or Verizon as a customer would have a material negative impact on our company. We believe that if either AT&T or Verizon were to terminate their relationship with us, that they would encounter substantial costs in replacing Synchronoss' solutions.\nCosts and Expenses\nOur costs and expenses consist of cost of services, research and development, selling, general and administrative, depreciation and amortization, change in contingent consideration, restructuring, interest and other expense.\nCost of services includes all direct materials, direct labor, cost of facilities and those indirect costs related to revenues such as indirect labor, materials and supplies. Our primary cost of services is related to our information technology and systems department, including colocation fees, network costs, data center maintenance, database management and data processing costs, as well as personnel costs associated with service implementation, customer deployment and customer care.\nResearch and development costs are expensed as incurred unless they meet the criteria for deferral and amortization under U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (\u201cGAAP\u201d). Software development costs incurred prior to the establishment of technological feasibility do not meet these criteria, and are therefore expensed as incurred. Research and development expense consists primarily of costs related to personnel, including salaries and other personnel-related expenses, consulting fees and the cost of facilities, computer and support services used in service technology development. We also expense costs relating to developing modifications and minor enhancements of our existing technology and services.\nSelling, general and administrative expense consists of personnel costs including salaries, sales commissions, sales operations and other personnel-related expenses, travel and related expenses, trade shows, costs of communications equipment and support services, facilities costs, consulting fees, costs of marketing programs, such as internet and print and other overhead and administrative costs.\nNet change in contingent consideration obligation consists of the changes to the fair value estimate of the obligation to the former equity holders which resulted from our acquisitions. The estimate is based on the weighted probability of achieving certain financial targets and other milestones. The contingent consideration obligation earn-out periods have been no longer than 12\n42\nTable of Contents\nmonths in duration. As such, we recognize the changes in fair value over that period. Final determination of the earn-out payment is done up to 90 days after the applicable earn-out period ends.\nRestructuring charges consist of the costs associated with work-force reduction plans to reduce costs and align our resources with our key strategic priorities. Restructuring charges include employee termination costs and facilities consolidation costs related to minimum lease payments of a leased location that was closed.\nDepreciation relates to our property and equipment and includes our network infrastructure and facilities. Amortization primarily relates to trademarks, customer lists, technology acquired and internally developed software.\nInterest expense consists primarily of interest on our lease financing obligations, our outstanding balance on our Credit Facility and our convertible senior notes.\nCurrent Trends Affecting Our Results of Operations\nBusiness from our Synchronoss Personal Cloud solution has been driven by the unprecedented growth in mobile devices globally. With mobile devices becoming content rich and acting as a replacement for other traditional devices like PC\u2019s, the ability to securely back up content from mobile devices, sync it with other devices and share it with family, friends and business associates have become essential needs. The major Tier 1 carriers are also publicly discussing achieving 500% penetration (multiple connected devices per user) by enabling connectivity to non-traditional devices. Such devices include connected cars, health and wellness devices, connected home and health care devices. The need for the contents of these devices to be stored in a common cloud are also expected to be drivers of our businesses in the long-term.\nBring Your Own Technology (BYOT\/BYOD) is impacting the work environment for enterprises and organizations which often find themselves in a position where they need to offer their employees a safe environment to share and collaborate on their work documents and files via mobile devices. We expect that by leveraging our Synchronoss Personal Cloud solution infrastructure and technology to build Synchronoss WorkSpace solutions for this purpose will enable us to serve a completely new market, which we believe will also contribute to our growth.\nTo support our growth we will be driven by these favorable industry trends mentioned above, we leverage modular components from our existing software platforms to build new products.  We believe that these opportunities will continue to provide future benefits and position us for future revenue growth. We are also making investments in new research and development of new products designed to enable us to grow rapidly in the mobile wireless market. Our purchase of capital assets and equipment may also increase based on aggressive deployment, subscriber growth and promotional offers for free or bundled storage by our major Tier 1 carrier customers.\nWe continue to expand our platforms' footprint with broadband carriers and international mobile carriers to support connected devices and multiple networks through our focus on cloud-based services for back up, synchronization and sharing of content. Our initiatives with AT&T, Verizon Wireless, Vodafone, Goldman Sachs, Softbank and other CSPs continue to grow both with regard to our current businesses as well as our new product offerings. We are also exploring additional opportunities through merger and acquisition activities to support our customer, product and geographic diversification strategies.\nFurther, with our acquisition of Intralinks, we have enhanced our position in the Enterprise market. Enterprise customers are looking to data to create more effective context for improving the employee work experience - particularly in ultra-secure environments.  The acquisition of Intralinks is an important step forward in our enterprise strategy that enhances our enterprise knowledge and experience upon which to leverage the Synchronoss product portfolio, go-to-market strategy and diversified customer footprint.  We believe this sets the stage for large cross-selling opportunities by accelerating our enterprise playbook. Together with Synchronoss and Intralinks as one company, we believe we can deploy enhanced enterprise and mobile solutions to our customers, while opening up new enterprise distribution channels across the world.  We believe this foundation will serve Synchronoss well as we build a comprehensive product roadmap and a go-to-market strategy for the enterprise market around identity, secure mobility, collaboration, and secure workflow platforms.\nWith the Intralinks acquisition, enterprise will now represent a significant portion of our total revenues, thus helping us further diversify our business model.\n43\nTable of Contents\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nThe discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based on our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. The preparation of these consolidated financial statements in accordance with U.S. GAAP requires us to utilize accounting policies and make certain estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, the disclosure of contingencies as of the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during a fiscal period. The Securities and Exchange Commission (\u201cSEC\u201d) considers an accounting policy to be critical if it is important to a company\u2019s financial condition and results of operations, and if it requires significant judgment and estimates on the part of management in its application. We have discussed the selection and development of the critical accounting policies with the audit committee of our Board of Directors, and the audit committee has reviewed our related disclosures in this Form 10\u2010K. Although we believe that our judgments and estimates are appropriate, correct and reasonable under the circumstances, actual results may differ from those estimates. If actual results or events differ materially from those contemplated by us in making these estimates, our reported financial condition and results of operations for future periods could be materially affected. See \u201cRisk Factors\u201d for certain matters bearing risks on our future results of operations.\nWe believe the following to be our critical accounting policies because they are important to the portrayal of our consolidated financial condition and results of operations and they require critical management judgments and estimates about matters that are uncertain.\nRevenue Recognition and Deferred Revenue\nWe provide services principally on a transactional or subscription basis or, at times, on a fixed fee basis and recognize the revenues as the services are performed or delivered as discussed below.\nTransactional and Subscription Service Arrangements.\nTransaction and subscription revenues consist of revenues derived from the processing of transactions through our service platforms, providing enterprise portal management services on a subscription basis and maintenance agreements on software licenses. Transaction service arrangements include services such as processing equipment orders, new account set\u2010up and activation, number port requests, credit checks and inventory management. Subscription services include monthly active user fees, software as a service (\u201cSaaS\u201d) fees, hosting and storage and the related maintenance support for those services.\nTransaction revenues are principally based on a contractual price per transaction and are recognized based on the number of transactions processed during each reporting period. Revenues are recorded based on the total number of transactions processed at the applicable price established in the relevant contract. The total amount of revenue recognized is based primarily on the volume of transactions. Subscription revenues are recorded one of two ways: on a straight\u2010line basis over the life of the contract or on a fixed monthly fee based on a set contracted amount.\nMany of our contracts guarantee minimum volume transactions from the customer. In these instances, if the customer\u2019s total transaction volume for the period is less than the contractual amount, we record revenues at the minimum guaranteed amount. At times, transaction revenues may also include billings to customers that reimburse us based on the number of individuals dedicated to processing transactions. Set\u2010up fees for transactional service arrangements are deferred and recognized on a straight\u2010line basis over the life of the contract since these amounts would not have been paid by the customer without the related transactional service arrangement. Revenues are presented net of discounts, which are volume level driven, or credits, which are performance driven, and are determined in the period in which the volume thresholds are met or the services are provided.\nProfessional Service and Software License Arrangements.\nProfessional services include process and workflow consulting services and development services. Professional services when sold with transactional or subscription service arrangements are accounted for separately when the professional services have value to the customer on a standalone basis and there is objective and reliable evidence of fair value of the professional services. When accounted for separately, professional service revenues are recognized as services are performed and all other elements of revenue recognition have been satisfied.\nIn determining whether professional service revenues can be accounted for separately from transaction or subscription service revenues, we consider the following factors for each professional services agreement: availability of the professional services from other vendors, whether objective and reliable evidence of fair value exists of the undelivered elements, the nature of the professional services, the timing of when the professional services contract was signed in comparison to the transaction or subscription service start date and the contractual independence of the transactional or subscription service from the professional services.\nIf a professional service arrangement were not to qualify for separate accounting, we would recognize the professional service revenues ratably over the remaining term of the transaction or subscription agreement.\n44\nTable of Contents\nRevenue from software license arrangements is recognized when the license is delivered to our customers and all of the software revenue recognition criteria are met. When software arrangements include multiple elements, the arrangement consideration is allocated at the inception to all deliverables using the residual method providing we have vendor specific objective evidence (VSOE) on all undelivered elements. We determine VSOE for each element based on historical stand\u2010alone sales to third\u2010parties.\nWhen transaction or subscription service arrangements, include multiple elements, the arrangement consideration is allocated at the inception of an arrangement to all deliverables using the relative selling price method. The relative selling price method allocates any discount in the arrangement proportionally to each deliverable on the basis of each deliverable\u2019s selling price. The selling price used for each deliverable will be based on VSOE if available, third\u2010party evidence (TPE) if vendor\u2010 specific objective evidence is not available, or estimated selling price (ESP) if neither vendor\u2010specific objective evidence nor third\u2010party evidence is available. The objective of ESP is to determine the price at which we would transact a sale if the product or service were sold on a stand\u2010alone basis. We determine ESP by considering multiple factors including, but not limited to, geographies, market conditions, competitive landscape, internal costs, gross margin objectives, and pricing practices. ESP is generally used for offerings that are not typically sold on a stand\u2010alone basis or for new or highly customized offerings.\nWhile we follow specific and detailed rules and guidelines related to revenue recognition, we make and use management judgments and estimates in connection with the revenue recognized in any reporting period, particularly in the areas described above, as well as collectability. If management made different estimates or judgments, differences in the timing of the recognition of revenue could occur.\nDeferred Revenue.\nDeferred revenues primarily represent billings to customers for services in advance of the performance of services, with revenues recognized as the services are rendered, and also include the fair value of deferred revenues recorded as a result of acquisitions.\nService Level Standards\nPursuant to certain contracts, we are subject to service level standards and to corresponding penalties for failure to meet those standards. All performance\u2010related penalties are reflected as a corresponding reduction of our revenues. These penalties, if applicable, are recorded in the month incurred and were insignificant for the years ended December 31,\n2016\n,\n2015\nand\n2014.\nAllowance for Doubtful Accounts\nWe maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated bad debts resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments. The amount of the allowance account is based on historical experience and our analysis of the accounts receivable balance outstanding. While credit losses have historically been within our expectations and the provisions established, we cannot guarantee that we will continue to experience the same credit losses that we have in the past or that our reserves will be adequate. If the financial condition of one of our customers were to deteriorate, resulting in its inability to make payments, additional allowances may be required which would result in an additional expense in the period that this determination was made.\nIncome Taxes\nSince we conduct operations on a global basis, our effective tax rate has and will depend upon the geographic distribution of our pre-tax earnings among locations with varying tax rates. We account for the effects of income taxes that result from our activities during the current and preceding years. Under this method, deferred income tax liabilities and assets are based on the difference between the financial statement carrying amounts and the tax basis of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates in effect in the years in which the differences are expected to reverse or be utilized. The realization of deferred tax assets is contingent upon the generation of future taxable income. A valuation allowance is recorded if it is \"more likely than not\" that a portion or all of a deferred tax asset will not be realized.\nIn evaluating our ability to recover our deferred tax assets within the jurisdiction from which they arise, we consider all available positive and negative evidence, including scheduled reversals of deferred tax liabilities, projected future taxable income, tax-planning strategies, and results of recent operations. In projecting future taxable income, we begin with historical results and incorporate assumptions including the amount of future state, federal and foreign pretax operating income, the reversal of temporary differences, and the implementation of feasible and prudent tax-planning strategies. These assumptions require significant judgment about the forecasts of future taxable income and are consistent with the plans and estimates we are using to manage the underlying businesses.\nWe recognize a tax benefit from an uncertain tax position only if it is more likely than not to be sustained upon examination based on the technical merits of the position. The amount of the accrual for which an exposure exists is measured by determining the amount that has a greater than 50 percent likelihood of being realized upon the settlement of the position. Components of the\n45\nTable of Contents\nreserve are classified as current or a long term liability in the consolidated balance sheets based on when we expect each of the items to be settled. We record interest and penalties accrued in relation to uncertain tax benefits as a component of interest expense. We expect that the amount of unrecognized tax benefits will change during\n2017\n; however, we do not expect the change to have a significant impact on our results of operations or financial position.\nWhile we believe we have identified all reasonably identifiable exposures and that the reserve we have established for identifiable exposures is appropriate under the circumstances, it is possible that additional exposures exist and that exposures may be settled at amounts different than the amounts reserved. It is also possible that changes in facts and circumstances could cause us to either materially increase or reduce the carrying amount of our tax reserves. In general, tax returns for the year\n2012\nand thereafter are subject to future examination by tax authorities.\nOur policy has been to leave our cumulative unremitted foreign earnings invested indefinitely outside the United States, and we intend to continue this policy. As such, taxes have not been provided on any of the remaining accumulated foreign unremitted earnings. Due to the timing and circumstances of repatriation of such earnings, if any, it is not practicable to determine the unrecognized deferred tax liability relating to such amounts. If the cumulative unremitted foreign earnings exceed the amount we intend to reinvest in foreign countries in the future, we would provide for taxes on such excess amount.\nStock\u2010Based Compensation\nAs of December 31,\n2016\n, we maintain four stock\u2010based compensation plans. We utilize the Black\u2010Scholes pricing model to determine the fair value of stock options on the dates of grant. Restricted stock awards are measured based on the fair market values of the underlying stock on the dates of grant. We recognize stock\u2010based compensation over the requisite service period with an offsetting credit to additional paid\u2010in capital.\nFor our performance restricted stock awards we estimate the number of shares the recipient is to receive by applying a probability of achieving the performance goals. The actual number of shares the recipient receives is determined at the end of the performance period based on the results achieved versus goals based on our performance targets, such as revenue and EBITDA. Once the number of awards is determined, the compensation cost is fixed and continues to be recognized using straight line recognition over the requisite service period for each vesting tranche.\nUse of a valuation model requires management to make certain assumptions with respect to selected model inputs. Expected volatility was calculated based on our historical information of our stock. The average expected life was determined using historical stock option exercise activity. The risk\u2010free interest rate is based on U.S. Treasury zero\u2010coupon issues with a remaining term equal to the expected life assumed at the date of grant. We have never declared or paid cash dividends on our common or preferred equity and do not anticipate paying any cash dividends in the foreseeable future. Forfeitures are accounted for as they occur.\nBusiness Combinations\nWe account for business combinations in accordance with the acquisition method. The acquisition method of accounting requires that assets acquired and liabilities assumed be recorded at their fair values on the date of a business acquisition. Our consolidated financial statements and results of operations reflect an acquired business from the completion date of an acquisition.\nThe judgments that we make in determining the estimated fair value assigned to each class of assets acquired and liabilities assumed, as well as asset lives, can materially impact net income in periods following a business combination. We generally use either the income, cost or market approach to aid in our conclusions of such fair values and asset lives. The income approach presumes that the value of an asset can be estimated by the net economic benefit to be received over the life of the asset, discounted to present value. The cost approach presumes that an investor would pay no more for an asset than its replacement or reproduction cost. The market approach estimates value based on what other participants in the market have paid for reasonably similar assets. Although each valuation approach is considered in valuing the assets acquired, the approach ultimately selected is based on the characteristics of the asset and the availability of information.\nWe record contingent consideration resulting from a business combination at its fair value on the acquisition date. Each reporting period thereafter, we revalue these obligations and record increases or decreases in their fair value as an adjustment to net change in contingent consideration obligation within the consolidated statement of income. Changes in the fair value of the contingent consideration obligation can result from updates in the achievement of financial or other operational targets and changes to the weighted probability of achieving those future targets. Significant judgment is employed in determining the appropriateness of these assumptions as of the acquisition date and for each subsequent period. Accordingly, any change in the assumptions described above, could have a material impact on the amount of the net change in contingent consideration obligation that we record in any given period.\n46\nTable of Contents\nRecent Acquisitions\nOn January 19, 2017, we completed the acquisition of Intralinks at a price of\n$13.00\nper share, or\n$850.0 million\n, net of working capital adjustments. For further details see the subsequent events footnote (Note 19).\nThe acquisition will allow the Company to leverage the Synchronoss' product portfolio, go-to-market strategy and diversified customer footprint and deploy an enhanced enterprise and mobile solution to customers while opening up new enterprise distribution channels across the world.\nOn March 1, 2016, we acquired all outstanding shares of Openwave Messaging, Inc. for $124.5 million, net of working capital adjustments and liabilities assumed, comprised of $102.5 million paid in cash and $22 million paid in shares of our common stock, based upon the average market value of the common stock for the ten trading days prior to the acquisition date.\nOpenwave\u2019s product portfolio includes its core complete messaging platform optimized for today\u2019s most complex messaging requirements worldwide with a particular geographic strength in Asia Pacific. With this acquisition and combined with our current global footprint, we will have increased direct access to subscribers around the world for the Synchronoss Personal Cloud platform and bolster our go-to-market efforts internationally.\nOn August 4, 2015, we acquired all outstanding shares of Razorsight for $25.3 million, net of liabilities assumed. Razorsight offers cloud-based analytics solutions for communications service providers. Their cloud-based products embed advanced statistical analysis and predictive analytics to proactively pinpoint customer attrition risk, revenue opportunities, and better customer experiences. We believe that this acquisition will strategically enhance our product portfolio allowing us to reach a broader client base by expanding our value proposition and more deeply embedding our platforms.\nOn February 23, 2015, we acquired certain cloud assets from F-Secure, an online security and privacy company headquartered in Finland, for cash consideration of $59.5 million, net of liabilities assumed. This acquisition expands our cloud services customer base.\nDiscontinued Operations\nManagement classifies a disposal transaction as discontinued operation in the consolidated financial statements when it qualifies as a component of the Company, meets the held for sale criteria, is disposed of by sale, or is disposed of other than by sale and it represents a strategic shift that has a major effect on our operations and financial results.\nRecent Divestitures\nOn December 16, 2016, we completed the divestiture of a portion of our carrier activation business (\u201cBPO\u201d) to a newly formed entity named Sequential Technology International, LLC (\u201cSTI\u201d), to leverage the assets sold as part of this transaction to STI's existing global customer care operations, for a total purchase price of\n$146 million\n. As part of the sales arrangement, we will retain a\n30%\ninvestment in STI, which can be reduced during the cour ents. Sequential Technology International Holdings, LLC, an unrelated third party that was formerly named Omniglobe International LLC, owns the remaining\n70%\nof STI. The divestiture of the service portion of the Activation business created a better overall solution for our customers as STI is positioned to capitalize on the combined experience of both teams and is expected to become a strong, global player, building on over a decade of call center operations.\nOn December 29, 2016, we completed the divestiture of our Mirapoint activation business to an unrelated third party and recorded a gain of $1.4 million on the sale.\nOn February 1, 2017, we completed the divestiture of our SpeechCycle business, to an unrelated third party, for consideration of $13.5 million. As part of the divestiture we entered into a 1 year transition services agreement with the acquirer to support various indirect activities such as customer software support, technical support services, maintenance and general & administrative support services.\nInvestments in Affiliates and Other Entities\nIn the normal course of business, we enter into various types of investment arrangements, each having unique terms and conditions. These investments may include equity interests held by us in business entities, including general or limited partnerships, contractual ventures, or other forms of equity participation. Management determines whether such investments involve a variable interest entity (\u201cVIE\u201d) based on the characteristics of the subject entity. If the entity is determined to be a VIE, then management\n47\nTable of Contents\ndetermines if we are the primary beneficiary of the entity and whether or not consolidation of the VIE is required. The primary beneficiary consolidating the VIE must normally have both (i) the power to direct the activities of a VIE that most significantly affect the VIE\u2019s economic performance and (ii) the obligation to absorb losses of the VIE or the right to receive benefits from the VIE, in either case that could potentially be significant to the VIE. When we are deemed to be the primary beneficiary, the VIE is consolidated and the other party\u2019s equity interest in the VIE is accounted for as a noncontrolling interest.\nWe generally account for investments that we makes in VIEs in which we have determined that we do not have a controlling financial interest but have significant influence over and hold at least a 20% ownership interest using the equity method. Any such investment not meeting the parameters to be accounted under the equity method would be accounted for using the cost method unless the investment had a readily determinable fair value, at which it would then be reported. We utilize a 1 month reporting lag in recording equity income from equity method investments.\nIf an entity fails to meet the characteristics of a VIE, management then evaluates such entity under the voting model. Under the voting model, we would consolidate the entity if it is determined that we, directly or indirectly, have greater than 50% of the voting shares, and determine that other equity holders do not have substantive participating rights.\nGoodwill\nGoodwill represents the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of assets acquired, including other definite\u2010lived intangible assets. Goodwill is not amortized, but reviewed annually for impairment or upon the occurrence of events or changes in circumstances that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of the reporting unit below its carrying amount. We performed our annual impairment test as of October 1,\n2016\n, and determined that there was no impairment. We do not believe we are at significant risk for impairment.\n48\nTable of Contents\nResults of Operations\nYear ended\nDecember 31, 2016\ncompared to the year ended\nDecember 31, 2015\nThe following table presents an overview of our results of operations for the\nyear\nended\nDecember 31, 2016\nand\n2015\n.\nYear ended December 31,\n2016\n2015\n2016 vs 2015\n$% of Revenue\n$% of Revenue\n$ Change% Change\n(in thousands)\nNet revenues\n$476,750\n100%\n$428,117\n100%\n$48,633\n11%\nCost of services*\n194,198\n41%\n155,287\n36%\n38,911\n25%\nResearch and development\n106,681\n22%\n91,430\n21%\n15,251\n17%\nSelling, general and administrative\n131,106\n27%\n88,411\n21%\n42,695\n48%\nNet change in contingent consideration obligation\n10,930\n2%\n760\n\u2014%\n10,170\n1,338%\nRestructuring charges\n6,333\n1%\n4,946\n1%\n1,387\n28%\nDepreciation and amortization\n99,311\n21%\n72,152\n17%\n27,159\n38%\nTotal costs and expenses\n548,559\n115%\n412,986\n96%\n135,573\n33%\n(Loss) income from continuing operations\n$(71,809\n)\n(15\n)%\n$15,131\n4%\n$(86,940\n)\n(575\n)%\n__________________________________________________________\n*\nCost of services excludes depreciation and amortization which is shown separately.\nRevenues\nNet revenues.\nNet revenues\nincreased\n$48.6 million\nto\n$476.8 million\nfor the\nyear\nended\nDecember 31, 2016\n, compared to the same period in\n2015\n. Transaction and subscription revenues as a percentage of sales were\n64%\nor\n$306.8 million\nfor the\nyear\nended\nDecember 31, 2016\ncompared to\n64%\nor\n$275.9 million\nfor the same period in\n2015\n. The increase in transaction and subscription revenue is primarily driven by new subscription arrangements as a result of our expansion with new customers.  Professional service and license revenues as a percentage of sales were\n36%\nor\n$170.0 million\nfor the\nyear\nended\nDecember 31, 2016\n, compared to\n36%\nor\n$152.2 million\nfor the same period in\n2015\n. The increase in professional services and license revenue is primarily due to new license agreements and expansion of services with our customers.\nWe derive our revenue from Cloud and Activation services and software licenses. Our Cloud service revenues include, among other things, revenue from our Personal Cloud, Messaging Cloud and Enterprise Cloud platforms.  Our Activation services revenues include, among other things, revenue from our Activation services, our Activation API software and Cloud Analytics.\nDuring the course of 2016, we divested a portion of our BPO business to STI.  Subsequent to December 31, 2016, we completed the sale of our SpeechCycle business.  As part of this strategic divestiture process we are maintaining our software activation API which is integral to the Razorsight Cloud Analytics platform. Since our acquisition of Razorsight, our Cloud Analytics technology has been used in both our Activation and Cloud business to provide augmented subscriber information to our mobile operator customers. Cloud Analytics has become a key component to our Personal Cloud offerings and, in late 2016, we began to offer the combined technology as our Cloud Analytics solution.\nAs a result of our activation divestitures, on an on-going basis, our business operations on our remaining activation assets are focused on driving cloud analytics and related cloud deals with carriers given a strategic focus around our existing API\u2019s and gateways which are integral to the Razorsight Cloud Analytics platform.  Activation assets remaining in the business are key to our core cloud business going forward.  We believe this combination of assets from both our Activation API's and Personal Cloud subscribers creates a new differentiating offering, providing us with a competitive advantage in our Cloud Analytics offering. As a result of this new offering we reclassified revenue historically derived from Cloud Analytics offering to the Cloud category.\n49\nTable of Contents\nThe following table outlines the reclassification.\nYear Ended December 31, 2016\nYear Ended December 31, 2015\nRevenue from Continuing Operations\nRevenue from Continuing operations\nPrior to\nCloud\nAfter\nPrior to\nCloud\nAfter\nReclassification\nAnalytics\nReclassification\nReclassification\nAnalytics\nReclassification\nActivation\n$112,652\n$(25,827\n)\n$86,825\n$118,133\n$(5,848\n)\n$112,285\nCloud\n364,098\n25,827\n389,925\n309,984\n5,848\n315,832\nNet Revenues\n$476,750\n$\u2014\n$476,750\n$428,117\n$\u2014\n$428,117\nOf the $86.8 million referenced above as 2016 Activation revenue after reclassification, roughly $50 million of these revenues related to activation assets which we have either sold or sunsetted, or do not plan to actively market or pursue in 2017.\nNet revenues related to Activation Solutions\ndecreased\n$25.5 million\nto\n$86.8 million\nfor the\nyear\nended\nDecember 31, 2016\n, compared to\nthe same period in\n2015\ndue to the completion of nonrecurring migration related work and professional service projects in 2015.

The increase was driven in part by a\n$17.0 million\nincrease in personnel and related costs which were driven by additional headcount due to the launch of our Enterprise solution and the Openwave acquisition. Included in this expense is mergers and acquisitions (\"M&A\") expenses, which increased\n$10.5 million\nas a result of our acquisition and divestiture activities. Professional services increased by\n$4.2 million\nas a result of accounting and legal costs related to our acquisitions, divestitures and tax planning. Outside consulting expenses increased by\n$4.9 million\ndue primarily to costs incurred for the launch of our Enterprise solution. The remaining increases included\n$3.0 million\nrelated to facilities and\n$3.2 million\nrelated to increases in bad debt expense.\nNet change in contingent consideration obligation.\nThe net change in contingent consideration obligation was a\n$10.2 million\nincrease\nfor the\nyear\nended\nDecember 31, 2016\nas compared to the\nyear\nended\nDecember 31, 2015\n. This was due to an achievement of the contractual milestones associated with the potential earn-out payments to the Razorsight shareholders.\nRestructuring charges.\nRestructuring charges were\n$6.3 million\nfor the\nyear\nended\nDecember 31, 2016\n, which related to employment termination costs as a result of the work\u2010force reduction plans that we commenced in March 2016 and in December 2016 that was designed to reduce costs and align our resources with our key strategic priorities.\nDepreciation and amortization.\nDepreciation and amortization expense\nincreased\n$27.2 million\nto\n$99.3 million\nfor the\nyear\nended\nDecember 31, 2016\n, compared to the same period in\n2015\n, primarily related to the increase in depreciable assets necessary\n50\nTable of Contents\nfor the continued expansion of our platforms and amortization of our newly acquired intangible assets related to our recent acquisitions.\nInterest expense.\nInterest expense\nincreased\n$1.3 million\nto\n$7.0 million\nfor the\nyear\nended\nDecember 31, 2016\n, compared to the same period in\n2015\ndue to an increase of approximately $0.9 million in contractual interest related to the drawdown from the Amended Credit Facility and $0.2 million related to increased financing costs and commitment fees for the Amended Credit Facility.\nOther income (expense), net.\nOther income (expense)\nincreased\n$1.5 million\nto\n$1.9 million\nfor the\nyear\nended\nDecember 31, 2016\n, compared to the same period in\n2015\ndriven by the $1.4 million gain on the sale of our Mirapoint activation business.\nIncome tax.\nWe recognized approximately\n$8.0 million\nand\n$5.4 million\nin income tax benefit and expense during the\nyear\nended\nDecember 31, 2016\nand\n2015\n, respectively. Our effective tax rate was approximately\n11%\nfor the\nyear\nended\nDecember 31, 2016\n, which was lower than our U.S. federal statutory rate due to the unfavorable impact of losses in foreign jurisdictions, which have lower tax rates than the U.S, the unfavorable impact of the fair market value adjustment for the Razorsight contingent consideration obligation and the recording of a non-cash income tax provision to establish a valuation allowance. We considered all available evidence, including our historical profitability and projections of future taxable income together with new evidence, both positive and negative, that could affect the view of the future realization of deferred tax assets. As a result of our assessment, we recorded a $9.3 million valuation allowance which reduced the deferred tax asset related to our current net operating losses of certain domestic and foreign subsidiaries. Our effective tax rate was approximately\n46%\nfor the\nyear\nended\nDecember 31, 2015\n, which was higher than our U.S. federal statutory rate due to the unfavorable impact of losses in foreign jurisdictions, which have lower tax rates than the U.S, the unfavorable impact of the fair market value adjustment for the Razorsight contingent consideration obligation and the recording of a non-cash income tax provision to establish a valuation allowance. We review the expected annual effective income tax rate and make changes on a quarterly basis as necessary based on certain factors such as changes in forecasted annual operating income, changes to the actual and forecasted permanent book-to-tax differences, and changes resulting from the impact of tax law changes.\n51\nTable of Contents\nYear ended December 31,\n2015\n, compared to the year ended December 31,\n2014\nThe following table presents an overview of our results of operations for the years ended December 31,\n2015\nand\n2014\n.\nYear ended December 31,\n2015\n2014\n2015 vs 2014\n$% of Revenue\n$% of Revenue\n$ Change% Change\n(in thousands)\nNet revenues\n$428,117\n100%\n$307,301\n100%\n$120,816\n39%\nCost of services*\n155,287\n36%\n102,386\n33%\n52,901\n52%\nResearch and development\n91,430\n21%\n73,620\n24%\n17,810\n24%\nSelling, general and administrative\n88,411\n21%\n77,081\n25%\n11,330\n15%\nNet change in contingent consideration obligation\n760\n\u2014%\n1,799\n1%\n(1,039\n)\n(58\n)%\nRestructuring charges\n4,946\n1%\n\u2014\n\u2014%\n4,946\n100%\nDepreciation and amortization\n72,152\n17%\n55,956\n18%\n16,196\n29%\nTotal costs and expenses\n412,986\n96%\n310,842\n101%\n102,144\n33%\nIncome (loss) from continuing operations\n$15,131\n4%\n$(3,541\n)\n(1\n)%\n$18,672\n(527\n)%\n__________________________________________________________\n*\nCost of services excludes depreciation and amortization which is shown separately.\nRevenues\nNet Revenues.\nNet revenues\nincreased\n$120.8 million\nto\n$428.1 million\nin 2015, compared to 2014.

The increase in professional services and license revenue is due to new license agreements of approximately $38 million with existing and new customers of which $20.3 million related to our new ventures with Verizon and Goldman Sachs. New releases in our personal cloud offering accounted for an additional $18 million of this increase.\nWe derive our revenue from Cloud and Activation services and software licenses. Our Cloud service revenues include, among other things, revenue from our Personal Cloud, Messaging Cloud and Enterprise Cloud platforms.  Our Activation services revenues include, among other things, revenue from our Activation services, our Activation API software and Cloud Analytics.\nDuring the course of 2016, we divested a portion of our BPO business to STI.  Subsequent to December 31, 2016, we completed the sale of our SpeechCycle business.  As part of this strategic divestiture process we are maintaining our software activation API which is integral to the Razorsight Cloud Analytics platform. Since our acquisition of Razorsight, our Cloud Analytics technology has been used in both our Activation and Cloud business to provide augmented subscriber information to our mobile operator customers. Cloud Analytics has become a key component to our Personal Cloud offerings and, in late 2016, we began to offer the combined technology as our Cloud Analytics solution.\nAs a result of our activation divestitures, on an on-going basis, our business operations on our remaining activation assets are focused on driving cloud analytics and related cloud deals with carriers given a strategic focus around our existing API\u2019s and gateways which are integral to the Razorsight Cloud Analytics platform.  Activation assets remaining in the business are key to our core cloud business going forward.  We believe this combination of assets from both our Activation API's and Personal Cloud subscribers creates a new differentiating offering, providing us with a competitive advantage in our Cloud Analytics offering.

The increase in professional fees relates to accounting and legal costs as a result of our acquisitions, tax planning activities and our patent licensing program. The most significant increases in outside consultants related to costs incurred for the launch of our Enterprise business, including our strategic ventures with Goldman Sachs and Verizon.\nNet Change in Contingent Consideration Obligation.\nThe net change in contingent consideration obligation decreased by $1.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2015. This was due to a $0.8 million increase in the contingent consideration for the year ended December 31, 2015 related to an increase in our potential earn-out payment to the Razorsight shareholders due to the achievement of certain milestones compared to a $1.8 million increase in 2014 in the fair value of contingent consideration associated with our potential earn-out payment to the Strumsoft shareholders.\nRestructuring charges.\nRestructuring charges were\n$4.9 million\nrelated to employment termination costs and facility consolidation costs, as a result of the workforce reduction plan started in January 2015, which was designed to reduce costs and align our resources with our key strategic priorities.\nDepreciation and Amortization.\nDepreciation and amortization expense increased $16.2 million to $72.2 million in 2015, compared to 2014, primarily related to the increase in depreciable fixed assets necessary for the continued expansion of our platforms and amortization of our newly acquired intangible assets related to our recent acquisitions and ventures.\nInterest Income.\nInterest income increased $0.8 million to $2.0 million in 2015, compared to 2014. Interest income increased primarily due to an increase in our cash, cash equivalents and investment balances during the year.\n53\nTable of Contents\nInterest Expense.\nInterest expense increased $2.3 million to $5.7 million in 2015, compared to 2014 due to an increase of approximately $2 million related to the convertible debt contractual interest together with amortization of deferred financing costs and an increase of $0.3 million related to interest paid on capital leases.\nOther Income.\nOther income decreased by less than $0.1 million to $0.4 million in 2015, compared to 2014. Other income decreased primarily due to the unavailability of a New York state refundable research and development tax credit in 2015 that had been available in 2014, as well as foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations.\nIncome Tax.\nDuring 2015 and 2014, we recognized approximately\n$5.4 million\nand\n$3.2 million\nin income tax expense and benefit, respectively. Our effective tax rate was approximately\n45.8%\nand\n61.6%\nduring 2015 and 2014, respectively. In 2015, our effective tax rate was higher than our U.S. federal statutory rate primarily due to the tax effect of non-deductible expenses and the unfavorable tax impact of losses in foreign jurisdictions which have lower tax rates than the U.S. offset by the favorable impact of the minority interest in the ventures and the tax credit for research and experimentation expenses.\nWe expect to be exposed to fluctuations in our effective tax rate during the earn-out period for our contingent consideration liabilities. Due to the nature of these transactions we may experience significant adjustments to fair value of the contingent consideration obligation depending on the outcome of the target achievements.\n54\nTable of Contents\nUnaudited Quarterly Results of Operations\nThe following tables includes unaudited financial data for the fiscal year quarters in\n2016\nand\n2015\n, which have been adjusted for discontinued operations.\nQuarter Ended\nMarch 31,\nJune 30,\nSeptember 30,\nDecember 31,\n(In thousands, except per share data)\n2016\nNet revenues\n(4)\n$104,219\n$118,255\n$132,480\n$121,796\nGross profit\n(2)\n57,771\n69,788\n83,407\n71,586\nIncome (loss) from continuing operations\n(20,555\n)\n(19,121\n)\n(1,856\n)\n(30,277\n)\nNet income (loss)\n(11,083\n)\n(7,303\n)\n4,833\n21,545\nNet income (loss) attributable to Synchronoss\n(3)\n(7,954\n)\n(4,439\n)\n7,676\n24,305\nBasic.\nContinuing operations\n(1)\n$(0.44\n)\n$(0.34\n)\n$(0.05\n)\n$(0.44\n)\nDiscontinued operations\n(1)\n0.26\n0.24\n0.23\n0.99\n$(0.18\n)\n$(0.10\n)\n$0.18\n$0.55\nDiluted.\nContinuing operations\n(1)\n$(0.44\n)\n$(0.34\n)\n$(0.05\n)\n$(0.44\n)\nDiscontinued operations\n(1)\n0.26\n0.24\n0.23\n0.99\n$(0.18\n)\n$(0.10\n)\n$0.18\n$0.55\nQuarter Ended\nMarch 31,\nJune 30,\nSeptember 30,\nDecember 31,\n(In thousands, except per share data)\n2015\nNet revenues\n(4)\n$95,431\n$102,176\n$109,297\n$121,213\nGross profit\n(2)\n61,824\n66,231\n69,074\n75,701\nIncome (loss) from continuing operations\n1,445\n7,574\n4,565\n1,547\nNet income\n10,561\n15,154\n9,645\n11,322\nNet income (loss) attributable to Synchronoss\n10,561\n15,154\n9,645\n5,270\nBasic.\nContinuing operations\n(1)\n$(0.01\n)\n$0.11\n$(0.04\n)\n$(0.05\n)\nDiscontinued operations\n(1)\n0.26\n0.25\n0.27\n0.17\n$0.25\n$0.36\n$0.23\n$0.12\nDiluted.\nContinuing operations\n(1)\n$(0.01\n)\n$0.11\n$(0.04\n)\n$(0.05\n)\nDiscontinued operations\n(1)\n0.26\n0.25\n0.27\n0.17\n$0.25\n$0.36\n$0.23\n$0.12\n__________________________________________________________\n(1)\nPer common share amounts for the quarters and full year have been calculated separately. Accordingly, quarterly amounts do not add to the annual amount because of differences in the number of weighted\u2010average common shares outstanding during each period which results principally from the effect of issuing shares of our common stock and options throughout the year.\n(2)\nGross profit is defined as net revenues less cost of services and excludes depreciation and amortization expense.\n(3)\nNet income for the quarter ended March 31, 2016 included a $0.6 million income tax expense adjustment related to the elimination of the additional paid-in-capital or APIC Pool as a result of the adoption of ASU 2016-09.\n55\nTable of Contents\n(4)\nIn the Pro Forma Financial Information which we filed as part of our Form 8-K on December 22, 2016 in connection with the divestiture of our BPO business referenced above, net revenues for our Activation API software; which were not included in the divestiture, for the nine month period ended September 30, 2016 were originally classified as revenue from discontinued operations instead of continuing operations.  Specifically, net revenues for each of the quarters of March 31, June 30 and September 30 reflect revenues of $1.3 million, $1.2 million and $2.4 million, respectively, that were originally classified as revenue from discontinued operations instead of continuing operations. This was adjusted in the quarter ended December 31, 2016 by adding these amounts to the above revenue for that quarter, and these  amounts were further offset by reducing revenues from continuing operations in the quarter of approximately $5.0 million as a result of the timing of the divesture of the BPO business in the quarter.\n56\nTable of Contents\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nAs of\nDecember 31, 2016\n, our principal source of liquidity has been cash provided by operations and borrowings on our Amended Credit Facility. Our cash, cash equivalents, marketable securities and restricted cash balance was\n$226.5 million\nat\nDecember 31, 2016\n. We anticipate that our principal uses of cash in the future will be to fund the expansion of our business through both organic growth and acquisition activities and the expansion of our customer base.  Uses of cash will also include facility and technology expansion, significant integration and restructuring activities, capital expenditures, and working capital.\nAt\nDecember 31, 2016\n, our non-U.S. subsidiaries held approximately\n$25.5 million\nof cash and cash equivalents that are available for use by all of our operations around the world. At this time, we believe the funds held by all non-U.S. subsidiaries, except those acquired as part of the Openwave acquisition, will be permanently reinvested outside of the U.S. However, if these funds were repatriated to the U.S. or used for U.S. operations, certain amounts could be subject to U.S. tax for the incremental amount in excess of the foreign tax paid. Due to the timing and circumstances of repatriation of these earnings, if any, it is not practical to determine the unrecognized deferred tax liability related to the amount.\nCredit Rating\nOur credit ratings impact our access to the debt capital markets and cost of capital. Our long-term credit ratings as of January 6, 2017 are as follows.\nLong-term\nOutlook\nMoody's Investors Service\nB1\nPositive\nS&P Global Ratings\nBB-\nStable\n2013 Credit Facility\nIn September 2013, we entered into a Credit Agreement (the \u201cCredit Facility\u201d) with JP Morgan Chase Bank, N.A., as the administrative agent, Wells Fargo Bank, National Association, as the syndication agent and Capital One, National Association and KeyBank National Association, as co-documentation agents.  The Credit Facility, which was used for general corporate purposes, was a\n$100 million\nunsecured revolving line of credit that was set to mature on September 27, 2018.  We paid a commitment fee in the range of\n25\nto\n35\nbasis points on the unused balance of the revolving credit facility under this credit agreement. We had the right to request an increase in the aggregate principal amount of the Credit Facility up to\n$150 million.\nInterest on the borrowing was based upon LIBOR plus a\n2.25\nbasis point margin. All outstanding balances under the Credit Facility were repaid on July 7, 2016 and the 2013 Credit Facility was terminated and replaced with the Amended Credit Facility.\nAmended Credit Facility\nOn July 7, 2016, we entered into an Amended Credit Agreement (the \u201cAmended Credit Agreement\u201d) with Wells Fargo Bank, National Association, as administrative agent (the \u201cAdministrative Agent\u201d) and the several lenders party thereto. The Amended Credit Facility, which will be used for general corporate purposes, was a\n$250 million\nunsecured revolving line of credit that was set to mature on July 7, 2021, subject to terms and conditions set forth therein.  We paid a commitment fee in the range of\n15\nto\n30\nbasis points on the unused balance of the revolving credit facility under the Amended Credit Agreement. We have the right to request an increase in the aggregate principal amount of the Amended Credit Facility up to\n$350 million.\nInterest on the borrowing were based upon LIBOR plus a\n1.99\nbasis point margin. As of\nDecember 31, 2016\n, we had an outstanding balance of\n$29 million\non our Amended Credit Facility.\nThe Amended Credit Facility was subject to certain financial covenants. As of\nDecember 31, 2016\n, we were in compliance with all required covenants.\nOn January 19, 2017, the Company repaid all outstanding obligations under the Amended Credit Agreement with Wells Fargo Bank and the several lenders party thereto. The aggregate payoff amount was\n$29 million\nand included all accrued interest and associated prepayment penalties. For further details see the subsequent events footnote (Note 19).\n57\nTable of Contents\nConvertible Senior Notes\nOn August 12, 2014, we issued $230.0 million aggregate principal amount of 0.75% Convertible Senior Notes due in 2019 (the \u201c2019 Notes\u201d). The 2019 Notes mature on August 15, 2019, and bear interest at a rate of 0.75% per annum payable semi-annually in arrears on February 15 and August 15 of each year. We accounted for the $230.0 million face value of the debt as a liability and capitalized approximately $7.1 million of financing fees, related to the issuance. At\nDecember 31, 2016\n, the carrying amount of the liability was\n$226.3 million\nand the outstanding principal of the 2019 Notes was $230.0 million, with an effective interest rate of approximately\n1.39%.\n2017 Term Facility\nOn January 19, 2017, we completed the acquisition of Intralinks at a price of $13.00 per share.  In connection with the acquisition, we entered in to the 2017 Credit Agreement. We paid a total of approximately $904.1 million, in connection with the acquisition, including repayment of existing indebtedness for both Synchronoss, including the Amended Credit Facility and Intralinks, fees and costs associated with the Term Facility (as defined below) and other transaction related expenses as well as funded payments required to complete the acquisition with cash on hand and proceeds from the Credit Agreement. Our obligations under the 2017 Credit Agreement are guaranteed by certain of our subsidiaries, including Intralinks, and secured by substantially all of our assets and the guarantors.\nThe term loan lenders under the 2017 Credit Agreement have advanced to senior secured term loans in an aggregate principal amount of $900 million with a maturity date of January 19, 2024 (the \u201c 2017 Term Facility\u201d). The revolving lenders under the Credit Agreement have provided us with a revolving credit facility of up to $200 million with a maturity date of January 19, 2022 (the \u201cRevolving Facility\u201d). The term loans under the Term Facility will amortize at 1% per annum in equal quarterly installments with the balance payable on the final maturity date. The proceeds of the Term Facility are being used to finance a portion of the cash consideration in the Offer and the Merger, to refinance certain of our existing indebtedness, including the Amended Credit Facility and indebtedness of Intralinks (or our subsidiaries) and to pay related fees and expenses. The Revolving Facility includes borrowing capacity available for letters of credit and for borrowings on same-day notice under swingline loans, and borrowing thereunder may be used for working capital and other general corporate purposes.\nLoans under the 2017 Term Facility bear interest at a rate equal to, at our option, the adjusted LIBOR rate for an applicable interest period or an alternate base rate, in each case, plus an applicable margin of 2.75% or 1.75%, respectively. The revolving loans under the Revolving Facility initially bear interest at a rate equal to, at our option, the adjusted LIBOR rate or an alternate base rate, in each case, plus an applicable margin of 2.50% or 1.50%, respectively, subject to step-downs based on our ratio of first lien secured debt to adjusted EBITDA.\nSubject to certain customary exceptions, loans under the 2017 Term Facility are subject to mandatory prepayments in amounts equal to: (1) 100% of the net cash proceeds from any non-ordinary course sale or other disposition of assets (including as a result of casualty or condemnation) by Synchronoss or its restricted subsidiaries subject to customary reinvestment provisions and certain other exceptions; (2) 100% of the net cash proceeds from incurrences of debt (other than permitted debt); and (3) a customary annual excess cash flow sweep at levels based on Parent\u2019s then applicable ratio of first lien secured debt to adjusted EBITDA.\nThe 2017 Credit Agreement contains a number of customary affirmative and negative covenants and events of default, which, among other things, restrict our ability to incur debt, allow liens on assets, make investments, pay dividends or prepay certain other debt. The 2017 Credit Agreement also requires us to comply with certain financial maintenance covenants, including a total gross leverage ratio and an interest charge coverage ratio.\nCertain of the lenders under the 2017 Credit Agreement, or their affiliates, have provided, and may in the future from time to time provide, certain commercial and investment banking, financial advisory and other services in the ordinary course of business for the registrant and its affiliates, for which they have in the past and may in the future receive customary fees and commissions.\nShare Repurchase Program\nOn February 4, 2016, we announced that our Board of Directors approved a share repurchase program under which we may repurchase up to $100 million of our outstanding common stock for 12 to 18 months following the announcement.\nAs of\nDecember 31, 2016\n, we repurchased approximately\n1.3 million\nshares of our common stock under this program for an aggregate repurchase price of\n$40.0 million.\n58\nTable of Contents\nDiscussion of Cash Flows\nYear ended December 31,\n2016\n, compared to the year ended December 31,\n2015\nA summary of net cash flows follows (in thousands).\nYear ended December 31,\n2016\n2015\nChange\nNet cash provided by (used in).\n(As adjusted)\nOperating activities\n$142,589\n$139,822\n$2,767\nInvesting activities\n(99,376\n)\n(226,111\n)\n126,735\nFinancing activities\n(8,976\n)\n(1,694\n)\n(7,282\n)\nCash flows from operations\nCash\nprovided by\noperations\nincreased\nby approximately\n$2.8 million\nfor the\nyear\nended\nDecember 31, 2016\nand was primarily impacted by.\n\u2022\nIncrease of\n$63.9 million\nin net working capital, specifically, the favorable timing of collections.\n\u2022\nOffset by\n$69.3 million\ndecrease in non-cash items of which the net gain related to our divestiture was the most notable item.\nCash flows from investing\nCash\nused in\nfinancing activities\ndecreased\nby\n$126.7 million\nfor the\nyear\nended\nDecember 31, 2016\nand was primarily impacted by.\n\u2022\nDecreased purchases of marketable securities and acquisitions.\nCash flows from financing\nCash\nused in\nfinancing activities\ndecreased\nby\n$7.3 million\nfor the\nyear\nended\nDecember 31, 2016\nand was primarily impacted by.\n\u2022\nHigher net borrowings of $29 million.\n\u2022\nShare repurchases of $40 million.\nYear ended December 31,\n2015\n, compared to the year ended December 31,\n2014\nA summary of net cash flows follows (in thousands).\nYear ended December 31,\n2015\n2014\nChange\nNet cash provided by (used in).\n(As adjusted)\n(As adjusted)\nOperating activities\n$139,822\n$87,321\n$52,501\nInvesting activities\n(226,111\n)\n(152,980\n)\n(73,131\n)\nFinancing activities\n(1,694\n)\n237,961\n(239,655\n)\nCash Flows from Operations\nCash\nprovided by\noperations\nincreased\nby approximately\n$52.5 million\nfor the\nyear\nended\nDecember 31, 2015\nand was primarily impacted by.\n\u2022\nAn increase in net income and non-cash items of\n$29.7 million.\n\u2022\nAn increase in net working capital of\n$31.4 million.\n59\nTable of Contents\nCash flows from investing\nCash\nused in\nfinancing activities\nincreased\nby\n$73.1 million\nfor the\nyear\nended\nDecember 31, 2015\nand was primarily impacted by.\n\u2022\nApproximately\n$93.5 million\nrelated to 2015 acquisitions.\n\u2022\nPurchases of property and equipment related to our continued investments in our global information technology and business systems infrastructure.\nCash flows from financing\nCash\nused in\nfinancing activities\ndecreased\nby\n$239.7 million\nfor the\nyear\nended\nDecember 31, 2015\nand was primarily impacted by.\n\u2022\nThe issuance of the 2019 Notes for $230 million.\n\u2022\nDecreased proceeds from stock option exercises of approximately\n$10.1 million.\nWe believe that our existing cash and cash equivalents, cash generated from our existing operations, our available credit facilities and other available sources of financing will be sufficient to fund our operations for the next twelve months based on our current business plans.\nEffect of Inflation\nAlthough inflation generally affects us by increasing our cost of labor and equipment, we do not believe that inflation has had any material effect on our results of operations during\n2016\n,\n2015\nand\n2014\n. We do not expect the current rate of inflation to have a material impact on our business.\n60\nTable of Contents\nContractual Obligations\nOur contractual commitments consist of obligations under leases for office space, automobiles, convertible debt and its associated interest expense, colocation agreements, computer equipment and furniture and fixtures.

Although the timing of the settlement is uncertain, we believe this amount will be settled within 3 years.\nRecently Issued Accounting Standards\nIn January 2017, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (\u201cFASB\u201d) issued Accounting Standards Update (\u201cASU\u201d) 2017-04,\nIntangibles-Goodwill and Other, Simplifying the Test for Goodwill Impairment,\nwhich eliminates Step 2 from the goodwill impairment test. Under the revised test, an entity should perform its annual, or interim, goodwill impairment test by comparing the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying amount. An entity should recognize an impairment charge for the amount by which the carrying amount exceeds the reporting unit\u2019s fair value; however, the loss recognized should not exceed the total amount of goodwill allocated to that reporting unit. This ASU is effective for any interim or annual impairment tests for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2019, with early adoption permitted. Management is currently evaluating the impact of the adoption on our consolidated financial statements.\nIn January 2017, the FASB issued ASU 2017-01,\nBusiness Combinations (Topic 805): Clarifying the Definition of a Business,\nwhich clarifies the definition of a business with the objective of adding guidance to assist entities with evaluating whether transactions should be accounted for as acquisitions (or disposals) of assets or businesses. ASU 2017-01 is effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017, and interim periods within those years, with early adoption permitted. Management is currently evaluating the impact of the adoption on our consolidated financial statements.\nIn November 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-18,\nStatement of Cash Flows (Topic 230): Restricted Cash,\nwhich amends the guidance in ASC 230, including providing additional guidance related to transfers between cash and restricted cash and how entities present, in their statement of cash flows, the cash receipts and cash payments that directly affect the restricted cash accounts. ASU 2016-18 is effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017, and interim periods within those years, with early adoption permitted. Management is currently evaluating the impact of the adoption on our consolidated financial statements.\nIn October 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-17,\nConsolidation (Topic 810): Interests Held through Related Parties That Are under Common Control,\nwhich amends the consolidation guidance in ASU 2015-02 regarding the treatment of indirect interests held through related parties that are under common control. ASU 2016-17 is effective for annual reporting periods beginning after\n61\nTable of Contents\nDecember 15, 2016, and interim periods within those years, with early adoption permitted. Management is currently evaluating the impact of the adoption on our consolidated financial statements.\nIn October 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-16, \u201c\nIntra-Entity Transfers of Assets Other Than Inventory\n,\u201d which requires entities to recognize at the transaction date the income tax effects for intra-entity transfers of assets other than inventory. The standard is effective for interim and annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017, with early adoption permitted. Management is currently evaluating the impact of the adoption on our consolidated financial statements.\nIn August 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-15,\n\u201cStatement of Cash Flows\n\u201d (ASU 2016-15). This new guidance will make eight targeted changes to how cash receipts and cash payments are presented and classified in the statement of cash flows. ASU 2016-15 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017. ASU 2016-15 will require adoption on a retrospective basis unless it is impracticable to apply, in which case we would be required to apply the amendments prospectively as of the earliest date practicable. Management is currently evaluating the impact of ASU 2016-15 on our consolidated financial statements.\nIn June 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-13\n\u201cFinancial Instruments-Credit Losses (Topic 326): Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments.\u201d\nThe amendments in this update replace the incurred loss impairment methodology in current GAAP with a methodology that reflects expected credit losses and requires consideration of a broader range of reasonable and supportable information to inform credit loss estimates. The ASU is effective for public companies in annual periods beginning after December 15, 2019, and interim periods within those years. Early adoption is permitted beginning after December 15, 2018 and interim periods within those years. Management is currently evaluating the impact of the adoption on our consolidated financial statements.\nIn February 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-02,\n\u201cLeases (Topic 842).\u201d\nUnder ASU 2016-02, lessees will be required to recognize, for all leases of 12 months or more, a liability to make lease payments and a right-of-use asset representing the right to use the underlying asset for the lease term. Additionally, the guidance requires improved disclosures to help users of financial statements better understand the nature of an entity\u2019s leasing activities. This ASU is effective for public reporting companies for interim and annual periods beginning after December 15, 2018, with early adoption permitted, and must be adopted using a modified retrospective approach. We are in the process of evaluating the effect of the new guidance on our consolidated financial statements and disclosures.\nIn May 2014, the FASB issued ASU 2014-09,\n\u201cRevenue from Contracts with Customers,\u201d\nwhich requires an entity to recognize the amount of revenue to which it expects to be entitled for the transfer of promised goods or s\ne\nrvices to customers. The ASU will replace most existing revenue recognition guidance in U.S. GAAP when it becomes effective. In March 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-08,\n\u201cPrincipal versus Agent Considerations (Reporting Revenue Gross versus Net),\u201d\nwhich clarifies the guidance in determining revenue recognition as principal versus agent. In April 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-10,\n\u201cIdentifying Performance Obligations and Licensing,\u201d\nwhich provides guidance in accounting for immaterial performance obligations and shipping and handling. In May 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-12, \u201cNarrow-Scope Improvements and Practical Expedients\u201d which provides clarification on assessing the collectability criterion, presentation of sales taxes, measurement date for non-cash consideration and completed contracts at transition. This ASU also provides a practical expedient for contract modifications. Finally, issued in December 2016, ASU 2016-20 makes minor corrections or minor improvements to the Codification that are not expected to have a significant effect on current accounting practice or create a significant administrative cost to most entities. The new standards are effective for public reporting companies for interim and annual periods beginning after December 15, 2017. The guidance permits two methods of adoption: retrospectively to each prior reporting period presented (full retrospective method), or retrospectively with the cumulative effect of initially applying the guidance recognized at the date of initial application (the cumulative catch-up transition method). Synchronoss has elected to use the modified retrospective transition method, with the cumulative effect of initially applying the guidance recognized at the date of initial application (the cumulative catch-up transition method).\nManagement  is in the process of completing an initial assessment and expects changes to current accounting policy in the following areas.\nFor certain software license arrangements, we currently use a ratable, or over time, revenue recognition method for software licensing arrangements where vendor specific objective evidence (VSOE) of the maintenance portion of the arrangement does not exist.  Under the new standard, we expect the timing of revenue recognition to be accelerated because we anticipate that the license revenue portion will be recognized at a point in time upon software license delivery, consistent with our current accounting policy for software arrangements where we can establish VSOE.\nProfessional services in certain software and in other consulting services arrangements are recognized over time under a proportional performance method. Under the new standard, professional services must meet one of three defined criteria for professional services to be recognized over time. The three criteria are.\n62\nTable of Contents\n\u25e6\nThe customer simultaneously receives and consumes the benefits as the Company performs,\n\u25e6\nThe customer controls the asset as the Company creates or enhances it,\n\u25e6\nor the Company\u2019s performance does not create an asset for which the entity has an alternative use, and there is a right to payment for performance to date.\nWhere contract terms do not qualify for one of the over time criteria, we expect that the timing of revenue recognition for professional services in these contracts would be delayed and recognized at a point in time.\nCertain implementation costs and other fulfillment costs, such as direct labor for contract set-up activities, that were previously expensed as incurred will be capitalized and amortized over the contract term and anticipated renewal periods. Capitalizing and amortizing these costs would have these costs recognized over a longer time period.\nOur contracts may contain customer options for additional goods and services at stated prices, which may be material rights under the new standards. A material right exists if a contract option provides the customer with a good or service at a discounted price that a similar customer would not otherwise be offered.  Under the new standards, material rights are treated as separate performance obligations and are allocated an estimated value. Where contract terms are determined to provide material rights, we expect that some portion the contract price will be allocated to these material rights and recognized in later periods.\nAt this time, we are not able to reasonably estimate the impact that adoption is expected to have.\nIn our implementation process, significant activities that are in process are the calculation of the transition adjustment, drafting and approval of new accounting policies, design and implementation of new processes and systems to accommodate the new policies and to compile the information for the enhanced disclosures under the new standards.  In addition, internal controls around the new policies, processes and systems need to be designed and implemented.\nImpact of New Accounting Pronouncements\nIn August 2014, the FASB issued ASU No. 2014-15,\n\u201cPresentation of Financial Statements - Going Concern (Subtopic 205-40): Disclosure of Uncertainties about an Entity\u2019s Ability to Continue as a Going Concern\n\u201d (ASU 2014-15). ASU 2014-15 is intended to define management\u2019s responsibility to evaluate whether there is substantial doubt about an organization\u2019s ability to continue as a going concern and to provide related footnote disclosures. This ASU provides guidance to an organization\u2019s management, with principles and definitions that are intended to reduce diversity in the timing and content of disclosures that are commonly provided by organizations today in the financial statement footnotes. The amendments are effective for annual periods ending after December 15, 2016, and interim periods within annual periods beginning after December 15, 2016. Early adoption is permitted. Adoption of this guidance, effective December 31, 2016, had no impact on the consolidated financial statements or disclosures.\nIn March, 2016, the FASB released ASU 2016-09,\n\u201cCompensation - Stock Compensation (Topic 718): Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting.\n\u201d\nThe ASU includes multiple provisions intended to simplify various aspects of the accounting for share-based payments. While aimed at reducing the cost and complexity of the accounting for share-based payments, the amendments may significantly impact net income, earnings per share, and the statement of cash flows. The ASU is effective for public companies in annual periods beginning after December 15, 2016, and interim periods within those years. Management elected to early adopt this standard in the second quarter ended June 30, 2016.\nASU 2016-09 eliminates the requirement to estimate and apply a forfeiture rate to reduce stock compensation expense during the vesting period and, instead, account for forfeitures as they occur. ASU 2016-09 requires that this change be adopted using the modified retrospective approach. As such, we recorded a cumulative-effect adjustment of\n$1.0 million\nto adjust our retained earnings.\nUnder ASU 2016-09, excess tax benefits related to employee share-based payments are not reclassified from operating activities to financing activities in the statement of cash flows. We applied the effect of ASU 2016-09 to the presentation of excess tax benefits in the statement of cash flows, retrospectively. This change increased the net cash provided by operating activities and decreased net cash provided by financing activities by\n$5.2 million\nand $15.1 million for the\nyear\ns ended\nDecember 31, 2015\nand 2014, respectively.\nUnder ASU 2016-09, cash paid when withholding shares for tax withholding purposes are classified as a financing activity in the statement of cash flows. ASU 2016-09 requires that this change be adopted retrospectively. The presentation requirements for cash flows related to employee taxes paid for withheld shares increased the net cash provided by operating activities and decreased\n63\nTable of Contents\nnet cash provided by financing activities by\n$17.0 million\nand $1.2 million for the\nyear\ns ended\nDecember 31, 2015\nand 2014, respectively.\nASU 2016-09 eliminates additional paid in capital (\"APIC\") pools and requires excess tax benefits and tax deficiencies to be recorded in the income statement when the awards vest or are settled. This increased our effective tax rate for the three months and year ended\nDecember 31, 2016\nby\n1%\n. The ASU requires that this change be adopted prospectively. We excluded the excess tax benefits from the assumed proceeds available to repurchase shares in our computation of diluted earnings per share for the three months ended\nDecember 31, 2016\n. This increased our diluted weighted average common shares outstanding by\n97,800\nshares and decreased the diluted weighted average common shares outstanding by\n66,363\nfor the three months and\nyear\nended\nDecember 31, 2016\n, respectively.\nASU 2016-09 eliminates the requirement that excess tax benefits be realized (i.e., through a reduction in income taxes payable) before they can be recognized. Previously unrecognized deferred tax assets were recognized on a modified retrospective basis which resulted in a cumulative-effect adjustment to our retained earnings of\n$0.5 million.\nAdoption of the new standard impacted our previously reported quarterly results as follows.\nThree Months Ended March 31, 2016,\nAs reported\nAs adjusted\nIncome statement.\nProvision for income taxes\n$(3,965\n)\n$(4,588\n)\nCash flows statement.\nNet cash from operations\n$37,731\n$40,489\nNet cash used in financing\n(35,253\n)\n(32,495\n)\nBalance sheet.\nDeferred tax liability\n$23,096\n$22,864\nAdditional paid-in capital\n535,326\n536,659\nRetained earnings\n194,012\n192,911\nManagement adopted ASU 2015-03, \u201c\nInterest- Imputation of Interest\n\u201d\n(subtopic 835-30);\n\u201c\nSimplifying the Presentation of Debt Issuance Costs\n\u201d\n,\nand ASU 2015-15\n,\n\u201c\nPresentation and Subsequent Measurement of Debt Issuance Costs Associate with Line of Credit Arrangements\n\u201d during the first quarter of 2016, concurrently. The adoption of these ASUs required us to reclassify the deferred financing costs associated with our Convertible Senior Notes from other assets to long-term debt on a retrospective basis. Our consolidated balance sheets included deferred financing costs of\n$3.7 million\nand\n$5.1 million\nas of\nDecember 31, 2016\nand\nDecember 31, 2015\n, respectively, which were reclassified from other assets to long-term debt. The debt issuance costs associated with our 2013 Credit Facility and Amended Credit Facility continue to be presented in other assets on the consolidated balance sheets.\nOff\u2010Balance Sheet Arrangements\nWe had no off-balance sheet arrangements as of and during the years ended\nDecember 31, 2016\nand\nDecember 31, 2015\nthat have, or are reasonably likely to have, a current or future effect on our financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources that are material to our interests.\n64\nTable of Contents","85":"ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT\u2019S DISCUSSION AND\nANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nYou should read the following discussion\nof our financial condition and results of operations in conjunction with financial statements and notes thereto included elsewhere\nin this report. The following discussion contains forward-looking statements that reflect our plans, estimates and beliefs. Our\nactual results could differ materially from those discussed in the forward-looking statements. Factors that could cause or contribute\nto these differences include those discussed below and elsewhere, particularly in \u201cRisk Factors\u201d section of the Company\u2019s\nprospectus, dated and filed with the SEC on August 11, 2016.\nOverview\nMassRoots, Inc. is a Delaware corporation\nformed on April 26, 2013. Our principal place of business is located at 1624 Market Street, Suite 201, Denver, CO 80202, our telephone\nnumber is (720) 442-0052 and our corporate website is www.MassRoots.com\/Investors. The information on our website, mobile apps,\nand blog is not a part of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nAs discussed in the Notes to the Financial\nStatements, the Company has experienced recurring losses and negative cash flows from operations since inception. We have relied\non equity financing to fund operations. There can be no guarantee that we will ever become profitable, or that adequate additional\nfinancing will be realized in the future or otherwise may not be available to us on acceptable terms, or at all. If we are unable\nto raise capital when needed or on attractive terms, we would be forced to delay, reduce or eliminate our development efforts.\nWe will need to generate significant revenues to achieve profitability and we may never do so. These factors raise substantial\ndoubt about the Company\u2019s ability to continue as a going concern. We have been implementing our strategic plan, as set forth\nbelow, on which we believe we will be able to continue operations and become profitable in the future.\nRevamped MassRoots for Business Portal\nWe originally introduced MassRoots for Business\nin early 2015 as an online portal for businesses to schedule posts and view analytics; while useful for businesses, it did not\nhave the features or capacity to scale to millions of dollars in revenue. Simultaneously with our migration from Parse, MassRoots\nbegan developing a new business portal directly on Amazon Web Services that took into account the feedback and research we received\nfrom over 2,500 cannabis-related businesses over the past year.\nWhen fully developed, the revamped MassRoots\nfor Business portal will consolidate many online marketing functions for cannabis-related businesses in one central platform.\nWe expect businesses will be able to schedule posts on MassRoots, Facebook and Twitter; purchase advertising on both MassRoots\nowned-properties as well as third party digital properties; and view actionable, real-time data from MassRoots and third party\nsources in easy-to-read formats. We believe this will serve as a solid foundation for future business-related features as we prepare\nto integrate dispensary point-of-sale data later this year.\nWe believe that MassRoots can reach profitability\nfrom its current User-base and web traffic. We are focused on including features in our app and website that they previously lacked,\nincluding the ability to connect Users with the dispensaries and products for which they are looking. We believe that our dispensary\nfinder is a solid first step in fixing this deficiency and product pages with live menu pricing will mostly resolve the problem\nby the end of the the second quarter of 2017.\nThe Team\nMassRoots has 31 full-time employees working\nout of headquarters in downtown Denver, Colorado. The majority of these employees are engineers focused on developing new features\nfor the MassRoots platform. We believe that over the long run, a small, talented and close knit team will outperform larger teams.\nWe believe we have found talented individuals at every level \u2013 sales representatives who outperform expectations; managers\nwho make architectural decisions that will prevent costly and time-consuming blunders; and engineers developing new features that\nhave the potential to provide significant long term returns.\nTable Of Contents\n16\nOne of MassRoots\u2019 top priorities in\n2016 has been recruiting and retaining some of the top talent in the cannabis and technology industries. In June 2016, we hired\nLance Galey as MassRoots\u2019 Chief Technology Officer. Previously, Mr. Galey served as Chief Software Architect of Cloud Services\nfor Autodesk and Vice President and Principle Architect at Salesforce, where he led the architecture and development of numerous\ncore infrastructure and platform services underlying a large portfolio of Salesforce SaaS applications. In 2013, he\nwas selected as the executive MVP for the technology division of Salesforce.com.\nState and National Brand Business Model\nWhile MassRoots\u2019 consumer-facing network\nlaunched in July 2013, we did not start generating advertising revenue until we crossed a half million Users in mid-August 2015.\nOur clients have primarily been ancillary businesses marketing their products to cannabis consumers through endorsed posts on\nMassRoots, sponsored content on our blog, and mentions in our email newsletter. It is not necessary for a User to join MassRoots\nin order for us to generate revenue from them \u2013 we are finding that many people will visit our website, join our email newsletter,\nor view a dispensary\u2019s profile without registering for our MassRoots network.\nWhile the vast majority of MassRoots\u2019\nadvertising revenue to date has come from brands within the cannabis industry, we have started to see significant interest from\nmainstream brands and advertising agencies looking to market to cannabis consumers. Uber and Fusion, a division of Univision,\nbecame the first mainstream brands to advertise with MassRoots and have opened the doors for other major brands to evaluate the\nspace. We believe that as the regulated cannabis market continues to expand, mainstream brands and advertising agencies will begin\nto allocate portions of multi-million advertising budgets towards outreach to the millions of cannabis consumers in the United\nStates \u2013 especially food, lighter and agricultural brands. We are positioning MassRoots to be one of the first companies\nto receive these budget allocations.\n2016 Elections\nOn November 8, 2016, voters in California,\nNevada, Maine and Massachusetts voted to regulate the production and sale of cannabis for recreational purposes while Florida,\nNorth Dakota, Arkansas and Montana voters authorized its medical use. According to ArcView Market Research, these initiatives\nwill cause the regulated cannabis industry to expand from roughly $6 billion in 2016 to more than $23 billion once these initiatives\ntake effect.\nOur business model is designed to benefit\nfrom this trend. When a new state passes a medical or recreational cannabis law, we are able to start registering users and businesses\nin that state with minimal marginal cost. Because MassRoots is not involved in the production or sale of cannabis, we do not have\nto build outgrow operations, open retail stores, or have a significant physical presence in the state in order to generate revenue.\nAt the same time, MassRoots\u2019 financial model is not tied to the success of a particular location or brand \u2013 we believe\nwe will have a significant percentage of all dispensaries and brands on our platform, making MassRoots a play on the industry\nas a whole.\nSitting at the intersection of healthcare\non the medical cannabis side and a vice industry on the recreational cannabis side, we believe the cannabis industry can continue\nto grow in any economic climate.\nCompetition\nAs more of our localized advertising features\ncome online throughout 2017, we are competing with dispensary locators and strain guides, such as WeedMaps and Leafly, for dispensaries\u2019\nadvertising budgets.\nTable Of Contents\n17\nResults Of Operations\nFor the Fiscal Year ended\n31-Dec-16\n31-Dec-15\n$ Change% Change\nGross revenue\n$701,581\n$213,963\n$487,618\n227.9%\nOperating expenses\n14,303,960\n6,339,063\n7,964,897\n125.6%\nLoss from Operations\n(13,602,379\n)\n(6,125,100\n)\n(7,477,279\n)\n(122.1\n)%\nOther Income \/(Expense)\n(4,427,745\n)\n(2,347,798\n)\n(2,079,947\n)\n(88.6\n)%\nNet Loss\n(18,030,124\n)\n(8,472,898\n)\n(9,557,226\n)\n(112.8\n)%\nNet loss per share - basic and diluted\n$(0.34\n)\n$(0.19\n)\n$(0.15\n)\n(79.9\n)%\nSince inception on April 26, 2013, and during the year ended December 31, 2016, our business operations have been primarily focused\ndeveloping our mobile applications, web platform and increasing our User-base.\nRevenues\nSince beginning to monetize our platform in\nAugust 2015, we have generated minimal revenues from our operations. We cannot guarantee we will be successful in our business\noperations. Our business is subject to risks inherent in the establishment of a new business enterprise, including the financial\nrisks associated with the limited capital resources currently available to us, and risks associated the implementation of our\nbusiness strategies.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2016, we generated\n$701,581 in total revenues, as compared to $213,963 for the year ended December 31, 2015, an increase of $487,618. This revenue\nwas primarily generated from advertising sales. Of our $701,581 in 2016 revenues, $669,778, or 95% was generated from advertising\nservices. Our User-base averaged roughly 850,000 Users during this time period, equating to an average of $0.78 in revenue per\nUser during 12 months of monetization.\nOperating Expenses\nOur cost of revenues increased $122,816 during\n2016, from $57,611 during fiscal year 2015 to $180,427 during fiscal year 2016. This increase was mainly a result of higher sales\nand merchandise activity in 2016.\nWe incurred $985,342 in advertising expenses\nduring fiscal year 2016, an increase of $267,569, from $717,773 in fiscal year 2015. This increase was mainly a result of increased\nmarketing in 2016.\nPayroll and related expenses increased $731,808\nto $2,112,879 during fiscal year 2016 from $1,381,071 during fiscal year 2016. This increase was mainly a result of added personnel\nin 2016.\nOver the course of fiscal year 2016, we issued\n$4,199,906 in common stock for services, as compared to $1,219,904 during fiscal year 2015, an increase of $2,980,002. This increase\nwas mainly a result of a combination of additional consultants added for our business development and higher valuation of our\nstock price.\nOptions issued for services also increased during fiscal year 2016 to $3,112,156\nfrom $1,273,483 during 2015, an increase of $1,838,673. This increase was mainly a result of compensation to employees past\nservices. We saw a decrease in the value of warrants issued for services from $229,365 during 2015 to $68,369 during 2016, a\ndecrease of $160,996.\nMassRoots\u2019 other general and administrative\nexpenses increased to $3,644,881 during fiscal year 2016 from $1,459,946 in 2016, an increase of $2,184,935. This increase was\nattributed to the following.\nTable Of Contents\n18\n\u2022\nLegal expenses increased during the year ended\nDecember     31, 2016 to $295,325 from $223,548 during the year ended December 31, 2015.  This increase was\nprimarily a result     of additional costs associated  with our Registration Statement filed  in 2016 and our March 2016\nNote     Offering.\n\u2022\nIndependent contractor expenses decreased from $144,452\nduring 2015 to $72,183 during 2016 due to our initiative to bring all programing and development in house in 2015.\n\u2022\nDuring fiscal 2016, MassRoots incurred $2,112,690\nin consulting and accounting related expenses as compared to $345,411 in fiscal 2015.  This increase was primarily\ncaused by increased investor relations and other professionals in establishing a market for our common stock.\n\u2022\nTravel and related expenses increased to $188,723\nin fiscal 2016 from $182,929 during the same period in 2015. Over the course of the year, the MassRoots team attended over\n25 conferences and hundreds of meetings with cannabis related businesses that have built the relationships necessary for our\nCompany to grow.\nThe combination of these increasing expenditures\nresulted in MassRoots\u2019 total operating expenses growing to $14,303,960 in fiscal year 2016 versus $6,339,063 in 2015, an\nincrease of $7,964,897.\nLoss from Operations\nMassRoots\u2019 Loss from Operations increased\n$7,477,279 to $13,602,379 during fiscal year 2016, from $6,125,100 during fiscal year 2015.\nOther Income (Expense)\nDuring the fiscal years ended 2016 and 2015, the\nCompany realized losses related to the fair value mark to market adjustments of its derivative liabilities of $581,912 and $2,236,401,\nrespectively.\nDuring the fiscal years ended 2016 and 2015, interest expense increased to\n$3,845,833 during fiscal 2016 from $111,397 during fiscal 2015, an increase of $3,734,436. This increase is mainly from\nnon-cash interest and penalty charges relating to our 2016 issued convertible debt of $1,265,376 and $763,872, respectively\nand amortization of debt discounts. For the fiscal years ended 2016 and 2015, the Company recorded amortization of discount on\nnotes payable of $1,549,669 and $107,016, respectively.\nNet Loss\nOur net loss increased $9,557,226 to $18,030,124\nduring fiscal year 2016, from $8,472,898 during fiscal year 2015.\nLiquidity And Capital Resources\nNet cash used in operations for the year ended\nDecember 31, 2016 and December 31, 2015 was $6,182,816 and $3,129,240, respectively. This increase was primarily caused by\na widening net loss in the Company\u2019s operations, an increase in the value of options issued to employees, and the interest\ncharged on the Company\u2019s March 2016 Note Offering. The root cause of these expenses is an increase of the size of MassRoots\u2019\nteam from 7 employees in early 2015, to 33 in early 2016.\nNet cash used in investing activities for\nthe year ended December 31, 2016 and December 31, 2015 was $83,750 and $244,035, respectively. These investing activities were\nrelated to the purchase of equipment, primarily computers, for the year ended December 31, 2016 and December 31, 2015 of $23,750\nand $69,035, respectively. During the year ended December 31, 2016, MassRoots made a deposit of our 2017 acquisition of DDDigtal\nLLC and in 2015, MassRoots made a one-time investment in Flowhub, LLC of $175,000; as we did not make any such investment in 2016,\nthe net cash used in investing activities decreased by $160,285.\nNet cash provided by financing activities for\nthe year ended December 31, 2016 and December 31, 2015 was $6,254,740 and $3,617,663, respectively. During the year ended\nDecember 31, 2016, these funds came mainly from warrant and option exercises, the Company\u2019s March 2016 Note Offering and\nequity issuances, while during the year ended December 31, 2015, they came primarily from equity issuances and warrant exercises.\nTable Of Contents\n19\nCapital Resources\nAs of December 31, 2016, we had cash on hand\nof $374,490. From January 1, 2017 through March 18, 2017, the Company received an aggregate of approximately $2,900,000 proceeds\nfrom the exercise of warrants to purchase shares of the Company\u2019s common stock. We believe the capital raised from the\nexercise of such warrants is sufficient to fund the Company\u2019s operations through the end of June 2017. In addition, as of\nMarch 18, 2017, there were warrants outstanding to purchase up to 561,000 shares of the Company\u2019s common stock with an\nexercise price of $0.40 per share and warrants outstanding to purchase up to 6,975,002 shares of the Company\u2019s common stock\nwith an exercise price of $0.90 per share, which, if all were exercised, would supply $6,501,902 in cash to the Company. These\nwarrants have various expiring dates through October 2019.\nWe currently have two credit cards with American\nExpress, one with a credit limit of $3,000 and one with no pre-set credit limit. Additionally, we have a $10,000 line of credit\nwith On-Deck Financial. We currently have no other external sources of liquidity such as arrangements with credit institutions\nor off-balance sheet arrangements that will have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial\ncondition or immediate access to capital.\nWe are dependent on the sale of our securities\nto fund our operations, and will remain so until we generate sufficient revenues to pay for our operating costs. Our officers\nand directors have made no written commitments with respect to providing a source of liquidity in the form of cash advances, loans\nand\/or financial guarantees.\nFundraising\nOn March 14, 2016, the Company completed its\nMarch 2016 Note Offering, whereby it sold to investors six (6) month secured convertible original issue discount Bridge Notes\nwith principal amount in the aggregate of $1,514,669, together with five year warrants to purchase an amount of shares of the\nCompany\u2019s common stock equal to the number of shares of common stock issuable upon the conversion of the Bridge Notes in\nfull and having an exercise price of $1.00 per share with reset provisions. The Bridge Notes were convertible into shares of the\nCompany\u2019s common stock at a price per share equal to the lower of (i) $1.00, and (ii) a 25% discount to the price at which\nthe Company next conducts an offering after the issuance date of the Bridge Note; provided, however, for any part of the principal\namount of the Bridge Note that was not paid at its maturity date, September 14, 2016, the conversion price for such amount was\nequal to 65% of the average of the three trading days with the lowest daily weighted average prices of the Company\u2019s common\nstock occurring during the fifteen days prior to such maturity date. On September 14, 2016, upon maturity of the Bridge Notes,\nthe Company was unable to make the required payment of the then outstanding aggregate principal amount of $966,384 and was in\ndefault under the Bridge Notes. Because the Bridge Notes were not repaid by the maturity date, the investors became entitled to\nreceive, in aggregate, but calculated pro rata to the principal amounts remaining outstanding at the time of maturity, up to five\nhundred thousand (500,000) shares of the Company\u2019s common stock. Gross proceeds received by the Company for the Bridge Notes\nand warrants in this offering were $1,420,000, while net proceeds were $1,271,600 (excluding any legal fees). As of October 7,\n2016, the Company completed the repayment of all outstanding principal and other amounts due under the Bridge Notes. Since the\nissuance of the Bridge Notes on March 14, 2016, the Company made payment to the holders of (i) an aggregate of $1,479,298 in cash\nand (ii) pursuant to the right of conversion of the Bridge Notes, issued an aggregate of 2,377,861 shares of the Company\u2019s\ncommon stock at a conversion price equal to 65% of the average of the three trading days with the lowest daily weighted average\nprices of the Company\u2019s common stock occurring during the fifteen days prior to September 14, 2016. The Company believes\nthat it has completed all of its obligations under the Bridge Notes and is no longer in default under the Bridge Notes or any\nrelated agreements. The Bridge Notes have been retired.\nFrom August 12, 2016 to October 21, 2016,\nCompany completed its 2016 Direct Registered Offering to certain investors, pursuant to which we raised an aggregate in $5,000,000\nin gross proceeds from the sale of shares of the Company\u2019s common stock, together with warrants, with one warrant entitling\nthe holder to purchase one share of common stock at a price equal to $0.90 per share.

Sample preparation is a term that refers to a wide range\nof activities that precede most forms of scientific analysis. Sample preparation is often complex, time-consuming and, in our\nbelief, one of the most error-prone steps of scientific research. It is a widely-used laboratory undertaking \u2013 the requirements\nof which drive what we believe is a large and growing worldwide market. We have developed and patented a novel, enabling technology\nplatform that can control the sample preparation process. It is based on harnessing the unique properties of high hydrostatic\npressure. This process, which we refer to as PCT, uses alternating cycles of hydrostatic pressure between ambient and ultra-high\nlevels i.e., 20,000 psi or greater to safely, conveniently and reproducibly control the actions of molecules in biological samples,\nsuch as cells and tissues from human, animal, plant and microbial sources.\nPCT\nis an enabling platform technology based on a physical process that had not previously been used to control bio-molecular interactions.\nPCT uses internally developed instrumentation that is capable of cycling pressure between ambient and ultra-high levels at controlled\ntemperatures and specific time intervals, to rapidly and repeatedly control the interactions of bio-molecules, such as proteins,\nDNA, RNA, lipids and small molecules. Our laboratory instrument family, the Barocycler\u00ae, and our internally developed consumables\nproduct line, which include our unique MicroTubes, MicroCaps, MicroPestles, BaroFlex and PULSE\u00ae (Pressure Used to Lyse Samples\nfor Extraction) Tubes, and application specific kits (containing consumable products and reagents), together make up our PCT SPS.\nIn\n2015, together with an investment bank, we formed a subsidiary called Pressure BioSciences Europe (\u201cPBI Europe\u201d) in\nPoland. We have 49% ownership interest with the investment bank retaining 51%. As of now, PBI Europe does not have any operating\nactivities and we cannot reasonably predict when operations will commence. Therefore, we don\u2019t have control of the subsidiary\nand did not consolidate them in our financial statements. PBI Europe did not have any operations in 2016.\nPatents\nPBI\nhas 14 United States granted patents and one foreign granted patent (Japan: 5587770, EXTRACTION AND PARTITIONING OF MOLECULES)\ncovering multiple applications of PCT in the life sciences field. PBI also has 19 pending patents in the USA, Canada, Europe,\nAustralia, China, and Taiwan PCT employs a unique approach that we believe has the potential for broad use in a number of established\nand emerging life sciences areas, which include, but are not limited to.\n\u25cf\nbiological\nsample preparation \u2013 including but not limited to sample extraction, homogenization, and digestion - in such study areas\nas genomic, proteomic, lipidomic, metabolomic and small molecule;\n\u25cf\npathogen\ninactivation;\n\u25cf\nprotein\npurification;\n\u25cf\ncontrol\nof chemical reactions, particularly enzymatic; and\n\u25cf\nimmunodiagnostics.\nWe\nare also the exclusive distributor, throughout the Americas, for Constant System\u2019s cell disruption equipment, parts,\nand consumables. CS, a British company located several hours northwest of London, England, has been providing niche biomedical\nequipment, related consumable products, and services to a global client base since 1989. CS designs, develops, and manufactures\nhigh pressure cell disruption equipment required by life sciences laboratories worldwide, particularly disruption systems for\nthe extraction of proteins. The CS equipment provides a constant and controlled cell disruptive environment, giving the user superior,\nconstant, and reproducible results whatever the application. CS has over 900 units installed in over 40 countries worldwide. The\nCS cell disruption equipment has proven performance in the extraction of cellular components, such as protein from yeast, bacteria,\nmammalian cells, and other sample types.\n-\n35\n-\nThe\nCS pressure-based cell disruption equipment and our PCT-based instrumentation complement each other in several important ways.\nWhile both the CS and our technologies are based on high pressure, each product line has fundamental scientific capabilities that\nthe other does not offer. Our PCT Platform uses certain patented pressure mechanisms to achieve small-scale, molecular level effects.\nCS\u2019s technology uses different, proprietary pressure mechanisms for larger-scale, non-molecular level processing. In a number\nof routine laboratory applications, such as protein extraction, both effects can be critical to success. Therefore, for protein\nextraction and a number of other important scientific applications, we believe laboratories will benefit by using the CS and our\nproducts, either separately or together.\nPrimary\nFields of Use and Application for PCT\nSample\npreparation is widely regarded as a significant impediment to research and discovery and sample extraction is generally regarded\nas one of the key parts of sample preparation. The process of preparing samples for genomic, proteomic, lipidomic, and small molecule\nstudies includes a crucial step called sample extraction or sample disruption. This is the process of extracting biomolecules\nsuch as nucleic acid i.e., DNA and\/or RNA, proteins, lipids, or small molecules from the plant or animal cells and tissues that\nare being studied. Our current commercialization efforts are based upon our belief that pressure cycling technology provides a\nsuperior solution for sample extraction when compared to other available technologies or procedures and thus might significantly\nimprove the quality of sample preparation, and thus the quality of the test result.\nWithin\nthe broad field of biological sample preparation, in particular sample extraction, we focus the majority of our PCT and constant\npressure (\u201cCP\u201d) product development efforts in three specific areas: biomarker discovery (primarily through mass spectrometric\nanalysis), forensics, and histology. We believe that our existing PCT and CP-based instrumentation and related consumable\nproducts fill an important and growing need in the sample preparation market for the safe, rapid, versatile, reproducible and\nquality extraction of nucleic acids, proteins, lipids, and small molecules from a wide variety of plant, animal, and microbiological\ncells and tissues.\nBiomarker\nDiscovery - Mass Spectrometry\nA\nbiomarker is any substance (e.g., protein, DNA) that can be used as an indicator of the presence or absence of a particular disease-state\nor condition, and\/or to measure the progression and effects of therapy. Biomarkers can help in the diagnosis, prognosis, therapy,\nprevention, surveillance, control, and cure of diseases and medical conditions.\nA\nmass spectrometer is a laboratory instrument used in the analysis of biological samples, often focused on proteins, in life sciences\nresearch. It is frequently used to help discover biomarkers. According to a recently published market report by Transparency Market\nResearch, \u201cSpectrometry Market (Atomic, Molecular and Mass Spectrometry) - Global Scenario, Trends, Industry Analysis,\nSize, Share & Forecast 2011 \u2013 2017,\n\u201d\nthe global spectrometry market was worth $10.2 billion in 2011 and\nis expected to reach $15.2 billion in 2017, growing at a compound annual growth rate of 6.9% from 2011 to 2017. In the overall\nglobal market, the North American market is expected to maintain its lead position in terms of revenue until 2017 and is\nexpected to have approximately 36.2% of the market revenue share in 2017, followed by Europe. We believe PCT and CP-based products\noffer significant advantages in speed and quality compared with current techniques used in the preparation of samples for mass\nspectrometry analysis.\n-\n36\n-\nForensics\nThe\ndetection of DNA has become a part of the analysis of forensic samples by laboratories and criminal justice agencies worldwide\nin their efforts to identify the perpetrators of violent crimes and missing persons. Scientists from the University of North Texas\nand Florida International University have reported improvements in DNA yield from forensic samples (e.g., bone and hair) when\nusing the PCT platform in the sample preparation process. We believe that PCT may be capable of differentially extracting DNA\nfrom sperm cells and female epithelial cells captured in swabs collected from rape victims and subsequently stored in rape kits.\nWe also believe that there are many completed rape kits that remain untested for reasons such as cost, time and quality of results.\nWe further believe that the ability to differentially extract DNA from sperm and not epithelial cells could reduce the cost of\nsuch testing, while increasing the quality, safety and speed of the testing process.\nHistology\nThe\nmost commonly used technique worldwide for the preservation of cancer and other tissues for subsequent pathology evaluation is\nprocess them into formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded (\u201cFFPE\u201d) tissue samples. We believe that the quality and\nanalysis of FFPE tissues is highly problematic, and that PCT offers significant advantages over current processing methods, including\nstandardization, speed, biomolecule recovery, and safety.\nOur\ncustomers include researchers at academic laboratories, government agencies, biotechnology companies, pharmaceutical firms,\nand other life science institutions in the North, Central, and South America; Europe, and Asia. Our goal is to continue\naggressive market penetration in these target groups. We also believe that there is a significant opportunity to sell and\/or lease\nadditional Barocycler\u00ae instrumentation to additional laboratories at current customer institutions.\nIf\nwe are successful in commercializing PCT in applications beyond our current focus area of genomic, proteomic, lipidomic, and small\nmolecule sample preparation, and if we are successful in our attempts to attract additional capital, our potential customer base\ncould expand to include hospitals, reference laboratories, pharmaceutical manufacturing plants and other sites involved in each\nspecific application. If we are successful in forensics, our potential customers could be forensic laboratories, military and\nother government agencies. If we are successful in histology (extraction of biomolecules from FFPE tissues), our potential customers\ncould be pharmaceutical companies, hospitals, and laboratories focused on drug discovery or correlation of disease states.\nGoing\nConcern\nWe\nhave experienced negative cash flows from operations with respect to our pressure cycling technology business since our inception.\nAs of December 31, 2016, we did not have adequate working capital resources to satisfy our current liabilities and as a result\nwe have substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. Based on our current projections, including equity\nfinancing subsequent to December 31, 2016, we believe we will have the cash resources that will enable us to continue to fund\nnormal operations into the foreseeable future.\nThe\naudit report issued by our independent registered public accounting firm on our audited consolidated financial statements for\nthe fiscal year ended December 31, 2016, contains an explanatory paragraph regarding our ability to continue as a going concern.\nThe audit report issued by our independent registered public accounting firm for our financial statements for the fiscal year\nended December 31, 2016 states that our auditing firm has substantial doubt in our ability to continue as a going concern due\nto the risk that we may not have sufficient cash and liquid assets to cover our operating and capital requirements for the next\ntwelve-month period; and, if sufficient cash cannot be obtained, we would have to substantially alter, or possibly even discontinue,\noperations. The accompanying financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty.\nThe\nconditions described above could adversely affect our ability to obtain additional financing on favorable terms, if at all, and\nmay cause investors to have reservations about our long-term prospects, and may adversely affect our relationships with customers.\nThere can be no assurance that our auditing firm will not issue the same opinion in the future. If we cannot successfully continue\nas a going concern, our stockholders may lose their entire investment in us.\n-\n37\n-\nRESULTS\nOF OPERATIONS\nYear\nEnded December 31, 2016 as compared with December 31, 2015\nRevenue\nWe\nhad total revenue of $1,976,487, in the year ended December 31, 2016 as compared with $1,797,691 in the prior year, a 10%\nincrease. The increase was due to product sales growth.\nProducts,\nServices, and Other\n. Revenue from the sale of products and services was $1,794,749 in the year ended December 31, 2016\ncompared with $1,409,991 in the year ended December 31, 2015, a 27% increase. Revenue included sales of both PBI and CS\u2019s\npressure-based products. Sales of instrumentation increased in 2016 by $369,909 or 44%, from $835,611 for FY 2015 to $1,205,520\nfor FY 2016. Sales of consumables were $199,873 for the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to $146,408 for the same period\nin 2015, an increase of $53,465 or 37%. Products, Services, and Other Revenue included $63,956 from non-cash transactions\nin the current year while the prior year included non-cash transactions of $78,743. Revenue from non-cash transactions was recognized\non the fair value of the assets involved per ASC 845.\nGrant\nRevenue\n. During 2016, we recorded $181,738 of grant revenue as compared with $387,700 in 2015. In December 2014, the\nCompany was awarded a $1,020,969 SBIR Phase II grant (2R44HG007136) from the National Human Genome Research Institute of the NIH.\nEntitled \u201cHigh Pressure Sample Preparation Instrumentation for DNA Sequencing\u201d, this grant is helping to fund the\ndevelopment of an automated, high-throughput, high pressure system (instrument and consumables) to enable significantly better\ncontrol of DNA fragmentation - a critical step in the preparation of samples for Next Generation Sequencing platforms. This system\nwill be based on significant technological advancements over the classic hydrodynamic DNA shearing approach that has been successfully\nand widely used in the field of DNA sequencing for many years.\nCost\nof Products and Services\nThe\ncost of products and services was $834,012 for the year ended December 31, 2016, compared with $609,054 in 2015. Our gross\nprofit margin on products and services was 58% for FY 2016 vs. 66% for FY 2015. The current year margin was affected by\nthe transfer of personnel to operations from sales and marketing. The relationship between the cost of products and services and\nrevenue depends greatly on the mix of instruments we sell, the quantity of such instruments, and the mix of consumable products\nand instrument accessories that we sell in a given period.\nResearch\nand Development\nResearch\nand development expenditures were $1,183,011 for 2016 compared to $1,105,295 in 2015, an increase of $77,716 or\n7%. This increase resulted primarily from the addition of a Ph.D. level electrical engineer, costs related to the continued\ndevelopment of an enhanced rape kit test based on the PCT Platform, and a rent increase related to additional R&D space. Research\nand development expense also included $65,500 and $50,617 of non-cash, stock-based compensation in 2016 and 2015, respectively.\nSelling\nand Marketing\nSelling\nand marketing expenses were $872,365 in 2016 compared to $745,574 in 2015, an increase of $126,791, or 17%. This increase is primarily\nattributed to an increase in employee staffing, collaboration activities, and rental space for product demonstrations.\nSelling and marketing expense included $42,314 and $32,704 of non-cash stock based compensation expense in 2016 and 2015, respectively.\nGeneral\nand Administrative\nGeneral\nand administrative costs were $2,822,752 in the year ended December 31, 2016, as compared with $2,902,950 in 2015, a decrease\nof $80,198 or 3%. This decrease was due primarily to credits received from charges incurred with a former professional\nservice provider offset by additional stock-based compensation. During the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, general and\nadministrative expense included $272,150 and $125,668 of non-cash, stock-based compensation expense, respectively.\n-\n38\n-\nOperating\nLoss\nOur\noperating loss was $3,735,653 for the year ended December 31, 2016 as compared to $3,565,182 for the prior year, an increase\nof $170,471 or 5%. This increase in operating loss was due primarily to increases in R&D and Sales and Marketing expenses,\noff-set to a certain extent by an increase in total revenue.\nOther\nincome (expense), net\nInterest\nExpense.\nNet interest expense totaled $4,501,186 for the year ended December 31, 2016 as compared to interest expense\nof $4,146,416 for the year ended December 31, 2015. In connection with loans issued in 2015 and 2016, we are amortizing deferred\nfinancing costs and imputed interest against the debt discount on loans.\nOther\nincome (expense) net\nWe\nrecognized $1,112 in expense during 2016, compared to $36,879 of expense from the initial fair value calculation on the conversion\noption on our convertible debt instruments in 2015.\nImpairment\nloss on investment\nThe\nvalue of our investment in common stock of Everest Investments Holdings S.A. (\u201cEverest\u201d) has declined since the date\nof receipt of the stock in 2015. We evaluated the decline and considered it as an \u201cother than temporary impairment\u201d\nreduction. Thus, the impairment loss was recognized as a charge in the consolidated statements of operations. During 2016,\nwe recorded total impairment losses related to $373,682 which represented the reduction in value of these securities.\nGain\non extinguishment of embedded derivative liabilities\nIn\nconnection with full payments of convertible debt, we recorded non-cash gains of $2,555,180 on short-term loans relating to the\nconversion options issued with the loans in 2015.\nChange\nin fair value of derivative liabilities\nDuring\nthe year ended December 31, 2016, we recorded non-cash income of $5,904,649 from warrant and conversion option liability\nrevaluations in our consolidated statements of operations due to a decrease in the fair value of the derivative warrants and the\nconversion option liabilities on our debt. This decrease in fair value was primarily due to a decrease in the price per share\nof our common stock. During the year ended December 31, 2015, we recorded non-cash charges of $2,222,001 for warrant and conversion\noption liability revaluations due to an increase in fair value of the liabilities.\nIncome\nTaxes\nWe\ndid not record an income tax benefit or provision for the years ended December 31, 2016 or 2015.\nNet\nLoss\nDuring\nthe year ended December 31, 2016, we recorded a net loss applicable to common stockholders of $2,706,984 or $(0.10) per\nshare, as compared with $7,438,492 or $(0.36) per share during the year ended December 31, 2015. This decrease in net loss is\nprimarily attributable to the current year non-cash income from warrant and conversion option liability revaluations.\n-\n39\n-\nLIQUIDITY\nAND FINANCIAL CONDITION\nAs\nof December 31, 2016, we did not have adequate working capital resources to satisfy our current liabilities. We have been successful\nin raising cash through debt and equity offerings in the past. We issued a promissory note in the aggregate principal amount of\nup to $2,000,000 in October 2016 that we can draw funds from, and, through March 1, 2017, we have drawn down the entire $2\nmillion ($750,000 subsequent to December 31, 2016). We have efforts in place to continue to raise cash through debt and equity\nofferings.\nWe\nbelieve our current and projected capital raising plans, and our projected continued increases in revenue, will enable us to extend\nour cash resources for the foreseeable future. Although we have successfully completed equity and debt financings and reduced\nexpenses in the past, we cannot assure you that our plans to address these matters in the future will be successful.\nWe\nbelieve we will need approximately $15 million in additional capital to fund our three-pronged operational plan, which was designed\nto help increase revenues and reach profitability, by.\nA.\nimplementing\na next-generation upgrade to our product line and offering a superior instrument with greater net margins;\nB.\ngaining\nadditional non-dilutive monies from governmental research and development applications, and\/or engineering projects; and\nC.\nhiring\na small team of sales and marketing persons to target research facilities and academic institutions, and cultivate our current\ncustomer list of pharmaceutical, military and paramilitary organizations.\nHowever,\nif we are unable to obtain such funds through sales, the capital markets or other source of financing on acceptable terms, or\nat all, we will likely be required to cease our operations, pursue a plan to sell our operating assets, or otherwise modify our\nbusiness strategy, which could materially harm our future business prospects. These conditions raise substantive doubt about our\nability to continue as a going concern.\nNet\ncash used in operating activities was $3,805,851 for the year ended December 31, 2016 as compared with $3,819,746 for the\nyear ended December 31, 2015. Our accounts payable balance was $407,249 as of December 31, 2016, as compared with $941,389\nas of December 31, 2015, a decrease of 57% from 2015. Accounts payable should continue to become more current as we continue\nto secure more capital and funds from operations; this should allow for more timely payments to our vendors.\nWe\ninvested $7,203 in fixed assets during the year ended December 31, 2016 as compared with $9,412 investment in fixed\nassets in the prior year.\nNet\ncash provided by financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2016 was $3,834,634 as compared with $3,471,993\nin the prior year.\nIn\n2016,\nA\n$2,105,420\nin aggregate net\nproceeds were raised from sales of convertible debentures and $107,000 payments were made for convertible debt.\nB\nLoans in the aggregate\namount of $1,022,784 were received during the year and we made payments on new and existing debt of $947,702.\nC\nFrom\nAugust 29 through December 31, 2016, we completed five tranches of a private placement, pursuant to which we sold and issued\nan aggregate of 1,525,000 shares of common stock, for a purchase price of $0.40 per share, resulting in net proceeds to us\nof $530,965.\nD\n$1,133,500\nin aggregate net proceeds were drawn down from a revolving note facility.\nE\n$116,667 net proceeds were received\nfrom related party debt and we made payments of $20,000\nOur\ncommon stock is currently traded on the OTCQB tier of the OTC Markets under the trading symbol \u201cPBIO.\u201d\n-\n40\n-\nCOMMITMENTS\nAND CONTINGENCIES\nRoyalty\nCommitments\nIn\n1996, we acquired our initial equity interest in BioSeq, Incorporated (\u201c\nBioSeq\n\u201d). At the time, BioSeq was developing\nour original pressure cycling technology. They acquired its pressure cycling technology from BioMolecular Assays, Inc. (\u201c\nBMA\n\u201d)\nunder a technology transfer and patent assignment agreement. In 1998, we purchased all of the remaining, outstanding capital stock\nof BioSeq; and, consequently, the technology transfer and patent assignment agreement was amended to require us to pay BMA a 5%\nroyalty on our sales of products or services that incorporate or utilize the original pressure cycling technology that BioSeq\nacquired from BMA. Similarly, the Company is required to pay BMA 5% of the proceeds from any sale, transfer or license of all\nor any portion of the original pressure cycling technology. These payment obligations terminated March 7, 2016. During the year\nended December 31, 2016 and 2015, we incurred approximately $6,963 and $31,301, respectively, in royalty expense associated with\nour obligation to BMA.\nIn\nconnection with our acquisition of BioSeq, we licensed certain limited rights to the original pressure cycling technology back\nto BMA. This license is non-exclusive and limits the use of the original pressure cycling technology by BMA solely for molecular\napplications in scientific research and development, and in scientific plant research and development. BMA is required to pay\nus a royalty equal to 20% of any license or other fees and royalties, but not including research support and similar payments,\nit receives in connection with any sale, assignment, license or other transfer of any rights granted to BMA under the license.\nBMA was required to pay us these royalties until the expiration of the patents held by BioSeq in March 2016. We have not received\nany royalty payments from BMA under this license.\nBattelle\nMemorial Institute\nIn\nDecember 2008, we entered into an exclusive patent license agreement with the Battelle Memorial Institute (\u201c\nBattelle\n\u201d).\nThe licensed technology is described in the patent application filed by Battelle on July 31, 2008 (US serial number 12\/183,219).\nThis application includes subject matter related to a method and a system for improving the analysis of protein samples including,\nthrough an automated system, utilizing pressure and a pre-selected agent to obtain a digested sample in a significantly shorter\nperiod of time than current methods, while maintaining the integrity of the sample throughout the preparatory process. Pursuant\nto the terms of the agreement, we paid Battelle a non-refundable initial fee of $35,000. In addition to royalty payments on net\nsales on \u201clicensed products,\u201d we are obligated to make minimum royalty payments for each year we retain the rights\noutlined in the patent license agreement; and, we are required to have our first commercial sale of the licensed products within\none year following the issuance of the patent covered by the licensed technology. After re-negotiating the terms of the contract\nin 2013, the minimum annual royalty was $1,200 in 2014 and $2,000 in 2015; the minimum royalties are $3,000 in 2016, $4,000 in\n2017 and $5,000 in 2018 and each calendar year thereafter during the term of the agreement.\nTarget\nDiscovery Inc.\nIn\nMarch 2010, we signed a strategic product licensing, manufacturing, co-marketing, and collaborative research and development agreement\nwith Target Discovery Inc. (\u201c\nTDI\n\u201d). Under the terms of the agreement, we have been licensed by TDI to manufacture\nand sell a highly innovative line of chemicals used in the preparation of tissues for scientific analysis (\u201c\nTDI reagents\n\u201d).\nThe TDI reagents were designed for use in combination with our pressure cycling technology. The respective companies believe that\nthe combination of PCT and the TDI reagents can fill an existing need in life science research for an automated method for rapid\nextraction and recovery of intact, functional proteins associated with cell membranes in tissue samples. We did not incur any\nroyalty obligation under this agreement in 2016 or 2015. We executed an amendment to this agreement on October 1, 2016 wherein\nwe agreed to pay a monthly fee of $1,400 for the use of a lab bench, shared space and other utilities, and $2,000 per day for\ntechnical support services as needed.\n-\n41\n-\nSeverance\nand Change of Control Agreements\nEach\nof Mr. Schumacher, Dr. Ting, Dr. Lazarev, and Dr. Lawrence, executive officers of the Company, are entitled to receive a severance\npayment if terminated by us without cause. The severance benefits would include a payment in an amount equal to one year of such\nexecutive officer\u2019s annualized base salary compensation plus accrued paid time off. Additionally, the officer will be entitled\nto receive medical and dental insurance coverage for one year following the date of termination.\nPursuant\nto severance agreements with each of Mr. Schumacher, Dr. Ting, Dr. Lazarev and Dr. Lawrence, each such executive officers, is\nentitled to receive a change of control payment in an amount equal to one year (other than Mr. Schumacher) of such executive officer\u2019s\nannualized base salary compensation, accrued paid time off, and medical and dental coverage, in the event of a change of control\nof our Company. In the case of Mr. Schumacher, his payment is equal to two years of annualized base salary compensation, accrued\npaid time off, and two years of medical and dental coverage.\nPursuant\nto our equity incentive plans, any unvested stock options held by a named executive officer will become fully vested upon a change\nin control (as defined in the 2005 Equity Incentive Plan) of our Company.\nLease\nCommitments\nWe\nlease building space under non-cancelable leases in South Easton, MA and lab space in Medford, MA. Rental costs are expensed as\nincurred. During 2016 and 2015 we incurred $125,819 and $105,169, respectively, in rent expense for the use of our corporate office\nand research and development facilities.\nFollowing\nis a schedule by years of future minimum rental payments required under operating leases with initial or remaining non-cancelable\nlease terms in excess of one year as of December 31, 2016.\n2017\n$122,220\nThereafter\n-\n$122,220\nOff-Balance\nSheet Arrangements\nWe\ndo not have any off-balance sheet arrangements as of December 31, 2016 and December 31, 2015.\nCRITICAL\nACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES\nPrinciples\nof Consolidation\nThe\nconsolidated financial statements include the accounts of Pressure BioSciences, Inc., and its wholly-owned subsidiary PBI BioSeq,\nInc. All intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.\nUse\nof Estimates\nTo\nprepare our consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States\nof America, we are required to make significant estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities\nand disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues\nand expenses during the reporting period. In addition, significant estimates were made in projecting future cash flows to quantify\ndeferred tax assets, the costs associated with fulfilling our warranty obligations for the instruments that we sell, and the estimates\nemployed in our calculation of fair value of stock options awarded and warrant derivative liability. We base our estimates on\nhistorical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of\nwhich form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from\nother sources. Actual results could differ from the estimates and assumptions used.\n-\n42\n-\nRevenue\nRecognition\nWe\nrecognize revenue in accordance with FASB ASC 605,\nRevenue Recognition\n. Revenue is recognized when realized or when realizable\nand earned when all the following criteria have been met: persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists; goods were shipped, delivery\nof service has occurred and risk of loss has passed to the customer; the seller\u2019s price to the buyer is fixed or determinable;\nand collectability is reasonably assured.\nOur\ncurrent Barocycler\u00ae instruments require a basic level of instrumentation expertise to set-up for initial operation. To support\na favorable first experience for our customers, upon customer request, and for an additional fee, will send a highly trained technical\nrepresentative to the customer site to install Barocycler\u00aes that we sell, lease, or rent through our domestic sales force.\nThe installation process includes uncrating and setting up the instrument, followed by introductory user training. Product revenue\nrelated to current Barocycler\u00ae instrumentation and Constant Systems products is recognized upon shipment of the unit. In the\ncase where the customer requests installation and training, the additional revenue related to the installation and training is\nrecognized upon the completion of the installation and introductory training process of the instrumentation at the customer location.\nProduct revenue related to sales of PCT instrumentation to our foreign distributors is recognized upon shipment through a common\ncarrier. We provide for the expected costs of warranty upon the recognition of revenue for the sales of our instrumentation. Our\nsales arrangements do not provide our customers with a right of return. Product revenue related to our consumable products such\nas PULSE\u00ae Tubes, MicroTubes, and application specific kits is recorded upon shipment through a common carrier. Shipping costs\nare included in sales and marketing expense. Any shipping costs billed to customers are recognized as revenue.\nWe\napply ASC 845, \u201cAccounting for Non-Monetary Transactions\u201d, to account for products and services sold through non-cash\ntransactions based on the fair values of the products and services involved, where such values can be determined. Non-cash exchanges\nwould require revenue to be recognized at recorded cost or carrying value of the assets or services sold if any of the following\nconditions apply.\na)\nThe\nfair value of the asset or service involved is not determinable.\nb)\nThe\ntransaction is an exchange of a product or property held for sale in the ordinary course of business for a product or property\nto be sold in the same line of business to facilitate sales to customers other than the parties to the exchange.\nc)\nThe\ntransaction lacks commercial substance.\nWe\ncurrently record revenue for its non-cash transactions at recorded cost or carrying value of the assets or services sold.\nIn\naccordance with FASB ASC 840,\nLeases\n, we account for our lease agreements under the operating method. We record revenue\nover the life of the lease term and we record depreciation expense on a straight-line basis over the thirty-six month estimated\nuseful life of the Barocycler\u00ae instrument. The depreciation expense associated with assets under lease agreement is included\nin the \u201cCost of PCT products and services\u201d line item in our accompanying consolidated statements of operations. Many\nof our lease and rental agreements allow the lessee to purchase the instrument at any point during the term of the agreement with\npartial or full credit for payments previously made. We pay all maintenance costs associated with the instrument during the term\nof the leases.\nRevenue\nfrom government grants is recorded when expenses are incurred under the grant in accordance with the terms of the grant award.\nRevenue\nfrom the sale of CS\u2019s cell disruption equipment, parts, and consumables is recognized when products are shipped.\n-\n43\n-\nDeferred\nrevenue represents amounts received from grants and service contracts for which the related revenues have not been recognized\nbecause one or more of the revenue recognition criteria have not been met. Revenue from service contracts is recorded ratably\nover the length of the contract.\nOur\ntransactions sometimes involve multiple elements i.e., products and services. Revenue under multiple element arrangements is recognized\nin accordance with FASB ASC 605-25\nMultiple-Element Arrangements (\u201cASC 605\u201d)\n. When vendor specific objective\nevidence or third party evidence of selling price for deliverables in an arrangement cannot be determined, we Company develop\na best estimate of the selling price to separate deliverables, and allocates arrangement consideration using the relative selling\nprice method. Additionally, this guidance eliminates the residual method of allocation. If an arrangement includes undelivered\nelements that are not essential to the functionality of the delivered elements, we defer the fair value of the undelivered elements\nwith the residual revenue allocated to the delivered elements. Fair value is determined based upon the price charged when the\nelement is sold separately. If there is not sufficient evidence of the fair value of the undelivered elements, no revenue is allocated\nto the delivered elements and the total consideration received is deferred until delivery of those elements for which objective\nand reliable evidence of the fair value is not available. We provide certain customers with extended service contracts with revenue\nrecognized ratably over the life of the contract.\nIntangible\nAssets\nWe\nhave classified as intangible assets, costs associated with the fair value of acquired intellectual property. Intangible assets,\nincluding patents, are being amortized on a straight-line basis over sixteen years. We perform an annual review of our intangible\nassets for impairment. When impairment is indicated, any excess of carrying value over fair value is recorded as a loss. As of\nDecember 31, 2016 and 2015, the outstanding balance for intangible assets was zero.\nLong-Lived\nAssets\nThe\nCompany\u2019s long-lived assets are reviewed for impairment in accordance with the guidance of the FASB ASC 360-10-05,\nProperty,\nPlant, and Equipment\n, whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the asset may not be\nrecoverable. Recoverability of an asset to be held and used is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of an asset to\nthe future undiscounted cash flows expected to be generated by the asset. If such asset is considered to be impaired, the impairment\nto be recognized is measured by the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds its fair value. Through December\n31, 2016, the Company had not experienced impairment losses on its long-lived assets. While our current and historical operating\nlosses and cash flow are indicators of impairment, we performed an impairment test at December 31, 2016 and determined that such\nlong-lived assets were not impaired.\nWarrant\nDerivative Liability\nThe\nwarrants issued in November 2011 in connection with the registered direct offering of Series D Convertible Preferred Stock\n(the \u201cSeries D Warrants\u201d) and the warrants issued in 2015 and 2016 in connection with the $6.3\nmillion PIPE convertible debentures (the \u201cDebenture Warrants\u201d) are measured at fair value and liability-classified\nbecause the Series D Warrants Debenture Warrants contained \u201cdown-round protection\u201d and therefore, did not meet the\nscope exception for treatment as a derivative under ASC 815,\nDerivatives and Hedging\n. Since \u201cdown-round protection\u201d\nis not an input into the calculation of the fair value of the warrants, the warrants cannot be considered indexed to the Company\u2019s\nown stock which is a requirement for the scope exception as outlined under ASC 815. The estimated fair value of the warrants was\ndetermined using the binomial model, resulting in an allocation of the gross proceeds of $283,725 to the warrants issued in the\nSeries D registered direct offering.\nIn\nconnection with the sale of convertible debentures in 2015 and 2016, the estimated fair value of the warrants was determined using\nthe binomial model, resulting in an allocation of the gross proceeds of $2,847,624 to the warrants issued with convertible debentures.\nThe fair value will be affected by changes in inputs to that model including our stock price, expected stock price volatility,\nthe contractual term, and the risk-free interest rate. We will continue to classify the fair value of the warrants as a liability\nuntil the warrants are exercised, expire or are amended in a way that would no longer require these warrants to be classified\nas a liability, whichever comes first.\nThe\ndown-round protection for the Debenture Warrants and Series D Warrants survives for the life of the Warrants. The down-round\nprotection for the Series D Warrants ends in May 2017.\n-\n44\n-\nConversion\nOption Liability\nWe\nhave signed convertible notes and have determined that conversion options are embedded in the notes and it is required to bifurcate\nthe conversion option from the host contract under ASC 815 and account for the derivatives at fair value. The estimated fair value\nof the conversion options was determined using the binomial model. The fair value of the conversion options will be classified\nas a liability until the debt is converted by the note holders or paid back by the Company. The fair value will be affected by\nchanges in inputs to that model including our stock price, expected stock price volatility, the contractual term, and the risk-free\ninterest rate. We will continue to classify the fair value of the conversion options as a liability until the conversion options\nare exercised, expire or are amended in a way that would no longer require these conversion options to be classified as a liability,\nwhichever comes first. We have adopted a sequencing policy that reclassifies contracts (from equity to liabilities) with the most\nrecent inception date first. Thus any available shares are allocated first to contracts with the most recent inception dates.\nAccounts\nReceivable and Allowance for Doubtful Accounts\nWe\nmaintain allowances for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments. Judgments are\nused in determining the allowance for doubtful accounts and are based on a combination of factors. Such factors include historical\ncollection experience, credit policy and specific customer collection issues. In circumstances where we are aware of a specific\ncustomer\u2019s inability to meet its financial obligations to us (e.g., due to a bankruptcy filing), we record a specific reserve\nfor bad debts against amounts due to reduce the net recognized receivable to the amount we reasonably believe will be collected.\nWe perform ongoing credit evaluations of our customers and continuously monitor collections and payments from our customers. While\nactual bad debts have historically been within our expectations and the provisions established, we cannot guarantee that we will\ncontinue to experience the same bad debt rates that we have in the past. A significant change in the liquidity or financial position\nof any of our customers could result in the uncollectability of the related accounts receivable and could adversely impact our\noperating cash flows in that period.\nInventories\nInventories\nare valued at the lower of cost (average cost) or market (sales price). The cost of Barocyclers consists of the cost charged by\nthe contract manufacturer. The cost of manufactured goods includes material, freight-in, direct labor, and applicable overhead.\nIn assessing the ultimate realization of inventories, management\njudgment is required to determine the reserve for obsolete or excess inventory. Inventory on hand may exceed future demand either\nbecause the product is obsolete, or because the amount on hand is more than can be used to meet future needs. We provide for the\ntotal value of inventories that we determine to be obsolete or excess based on criteria such as customer demand and changing technologies.\nWe historically have not experienced significant inaccuracies in computing our reserves for obsolete or excess inventory.\nEquity\nTransactions\nWe\nevaluate the proper classification of our equity instruments that embody an unconditional obligation requiring the issuer to redeem\nit by transferring assets at a determinable date or that contain certain conditional obligations, typically classified as equity,\nbe classified as a liability. We record amortized financing costs associated with our capital raising efforts in our consolidated\nstatements of operations. These include amortization of debt issue costs such as cash, common stock and warrants and\nother securities issued to finders and placement agents, and amortization of debt discount created by in-the-money conversion\nfeatures on convertible debt and allocates the proceeds amongst the securities based on relative fair values. We based our estimates\nand assumptions on the best information available at the time of valuation; however, changes in these estimates and assumptions\ncould have a material effect on the valuation of the underlying instruments.\nStock-Based\nCompensation\nWe\naccount for employee and non-employee director stock-based compensation using the fair value method of accounting. Compensation\ncost arising from stock options to employees and non-employee directors is recognized using the straight-line method over the\nvesting period, which represents the requisite service or performance period. The calculation of stock-based compensation requires\nus to estimate several factors, most notably the term, volatility and forfeitures. We estimate the option term using historical\nterms and estimate volatility based on historical volatility of our common stock over the option\u2019s expected term. Expected\nforfeitures based on historical forfeitures are used in calculating the expense related to stock-based compensation associated\nwith stock awards. Our estimates and assumptions are based on the best information available at the time of valuation; however,\nchanges in these estimates and assumptions could have a material effect on the valuation of the underlying instruments.","89":"","90":"ITEM 7.\nMANAGEMENT\u2019S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nThis management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations contains forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. Please see \u201cForward-Looking Statements\u201d for a discussion of the uncertainties, risks, and assumptions that may cause our actual results to differ materially from those discussed in the forward-looking statements.\nThe following discussion and analysis is based on, and should be read in conjunction with, the combined and consolidated financial statements and the related notes thereto, of MGP and the Operating Partnership for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014. Prior to April 25, 2016, the historical financial statements have been prepared on a \u201ccarve-out\u201d basis from MGM\u2019s consolidated financial statements using the historical results of operations, cash flows, assets and liabilities attributable to the IPO Properties, which were controlled by MGM, and have been determined to be the Predecessor of MGP and the Operating Partnership for accounting purposes (the \u201cPredecessor\u201d). These historical financial statements include allocations of income, expenses, assets and liabilities from MGM that reflect significant assumptions, and the combined and consolidated financial statements do not fully reflect what the financial position, results of operations and cash flows would have been had MGP or the Operating Partnership been a stand-alone company during the periods presented. As a result, historical financial information prior to the IPO Date is not necessarily indicative of the future results of operations, financial position and cash flows of MGP or the Operating Partnership. The financial position, results of operations and cash flows presented from the IPO Date through December 31, 2016 reflect the results of MGP and the Operating Partnership subsequent to the April 25, 2016 initial public offering.\nExecutive Overview\nMGP is a limited liability company that was formed in Delaware on October 23, 2015. MGP conducts its operations through the Operating Partnership, a Delaware limited partnership formed by MGM on January 6, 2016 and became a subsidiary of MGP on the IPO Date. MGP intends to make an election on its U.S. federal income tax return for our taxable year ended December 31, 2016 to be treated as a REIT.\nFollowing the completion of MGP's initial public offering, it became a publicly traded REIT primarily engaged in the real property business which consists of owning, acquiring and leasing large-scale destination entertainment and leisure resort properties, whose tenants generally offer casino gaming, hotel, convention, dining, entertainment and retail. MGM continued to hold a controlling interest in MGP following the completion of its initial public offering through its ownership of MGP's single Class B share. The Class B share is a non-economic interest in MGP which does not provide its holder any rights to profits or losses or any rights to receive distributions from operations of MGP or upon liquidation or winding up of MGP but which represents a majority of the voting power of MGP\u2019s shares. In addition, MGM continues to hold a majority economic interest in the Operating Partnership through its ownership of Operating Partnership units. One of MGP's subsidiaries is the sole general partner of the Operating Partnership.\nWe generate all of our revenues by leasing our real estate properties through the Landlord, a wholly owned subsidiary of the Operating Partnership, to the Tenant, a subsidiary of MGM, in a \u201ctriple-net\u201d lease arrangement, which requires the Tenant to pay substantially all costs associated with each property, including real estate taxes, insurance, utilities and routine maintenance, in addition to the base rent and the percentage rent, each as described below. The Master Lease has an initial lease term of ten years with the potential to extend the term for four additional five-year terms thereafter at the option of the Tenant. Additionally, the Master Lease provides us with a right of first offer to purchase the real estate assets with respect to the ROFO Properties in the event that MGM elects to sell them. The annual rent payments due under the Master Lease for the first lease year were initially $550 million and increased to $650 million for the remainder of the year following the completion of the Borgata Transaction. Payments under the Master Lease are guaranteed by MGM.\nAs of December 31, 2016, our portfolio consisted of ten premier destination resorts operated by MGM, including properties that we believe are among the world\u2019s finest casino resorts, and The Park in Las Vegas.\nBorgata Transaction\nOn August 1, 2016, MGM completed its acquisition of Boyd Gaming\u2019s ownership interest in Borgata. Immediately following such transaction, we acquired Borgata\u2019s real property from MGM for consideration consisting of the assumption of $545 million of indebtedness from a subsidiary of MGM and the issuance of 27.4 million Operating Partnership units to a subsidiary of MGM. The real property related to Borgata was then leased back to a subsidiary of MGM under an amendment to the existing Master Lease.\nPursuant to the amendment, the initial annual rent payments increased by $100 million, prorated for the remainder of the first lease year after the Borgata Transaction. Consistent with the Master Lease terms, 90% of this rent will be fixed and contractually grow at 2% per lease year until 2022.\n31\nThe Borgata Transaction was accounted for as a transaction between entities under common control, and therefore we recorded the Borgata real estate assets at their carryover value of $1.3 billion as determined by MGM in its purchase price allocation. In addition, we recognized an above-market lease liability and an above-market lease asset related to ground leases assigned to the Landlord as part of the Borgata Transaction covering approximately 11 acres partially underlying and adjacent to the Borgata. Under terms of the Master Lease, the Tenant is responsible for the rent payments related to these ground leases during the term of the Master Lease. We are amortizing the above-market lease liability on a straight-line basis over the terms of the underlying ground leases, which extend through 2070. We are amortizing the above-market lease asset on a straight-line basis over the term of the Master Lease, which extends through 2046 (including reasonably assured renewal periods).\nMaster Lease\nRent under the Master Lease consists of the base rent and the percentage rent. The annual rent payment due under the Master Lease was initially $550 million, which increased to $650 million after the Borgata Transaction for the remainder of the first year. For the first year, the base rent represents 90% of the initial total rent payments due under the Master Lease, or $585 million, and the percentage rent represents 10% of the initial total rent payments due under the Master Lease, or $65 million.\nBase Rent\nThe base rent is a base annual amount for the duration of the lease and includes a fixed annual rent escalator of 2.0% for the second through the sixth lease years (as defined in the Master Lease). Thereafter, the annual escalator of 2.0% will be subject to the Tenant and, without duplication, the Operating Subtenants of the properties collectively meeting an adjusted net revenue to rent ratio of 6.25:1.00 based on their net revenue from the leased properties subject to the Master Lease as determined in accordance with U.S. GAAP, adjusted to exclude net revenue attributable to certain scheduled subleases and, at the Tenant\u2019s option, reimbursed cost revenue. Base rent and percentage rent that are known at the lease commencement date will be recorded on a straight-line basis over 30 years, which represents the initial ten-year non-cancelable lease term and all four five-year renewal terms under the Master Lease, as we have determined such renewal terms to be reasonably assured.\nPercentage Rent\nThe percentage rent is a variable percentage rent which consists of a fixed annual amount for approximately the first six years of our Master Lease and is then adjusted every five years thereafter based on the average actual annual net revenues of the Tenant, and, without duplication, the Operating Subtenants from the leased properties subject to the Master Lease at such time during the trailing five-calendar-year period (calculated by multiplying the average annual net revenues-excluding net revenue attributable to certain scheduled subleases (and, at the Tenant\u2019s option, reimbursed cost revenue) for the trailing five-calendar-year period by 1.4%).\nUnder the Master Lease, the Tenant is required to maintain the premises in reasonably good order and repair. The Master Lease requires the Tenant to spend an aggregate amount of at least 1% of actual adjusted net revenues from the properties per calendar year on capital expenditures.\nGeneral and Administrative and Corporate Services\nWe incur general and administrative expenses for items such as compensation costs, professional services, legal expenses, certain costs of being a public company and office costs. In addition, we incur costs for corporate services from MGM for amounts reimbursed to MGM under the Corporate Services Agreement that covers financial, administrative and operational support services, including accounting and finance support, human resources support, legal and regulatory compliance support, insurance advisory services, internal audit services, governmental affairs monitoring and reporting services, information technology support, construction services and various other support services.\nGeneral and administrative expenses for the year ended December 31, 2016 were $9.9 million. Pursuant to the terms of the partnership agreement of the Operating Partnership, the Operating Partnership is required to pay for or reimburse MGP for these expenses-and generally for any expenses MGP incurs relating to the operation of, or for the benefit of, the Operating Partnership or MGP. Any such reimbursements are taken into account by our wholly owned subsidiary, the general partner, before causing the Operating Partnership to make any distributions to holders of Operating Partnership units and do not affect our pro rata entitlement, as a holder of Operating Partnership units, to distributions from the Operating Partnership.\nExpenditures necessary to maintain our properties in reasonably good order and repair are paid or reimbursed by the Tenant pursuant to the Master Lease. Other operating expenses relating to our properties such as property taxes and insurance are also paid or reimbursed by the Tenant pursuant to the Master Lease.\n32\nCombined Results of Operations for MGP and the Operating Partnership\nOverview\nThe following comparative discussion of results of operations for the year ended December 31, 2016 reflects the results of operations of the Predecessor through April 24, 2016 combined with the results of operations of MGP and the Operating Partnership from the IPO Date through December 31, 2016. The prior year periods reflect solely the results of operations of the Predecessor.\nRevenues\nRevenues, including tenant reimbursements and other, for the year ended December 31, 2016 were\n$467.5 million\n. Revenues for the year ended December 31, 2016 represent revenues generated by the Company from April 25, 2016 through December 31, 2016. The Predecessor generated no revenues during the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014. Tenant reimbursement and other revenue arises primarily from the triple-net structure of the Master Lease which provides for Tenant being responsible for payment of certain expenses as discussed above, including property taxes of the properties. We recognize revenue related to property taxes for which we are the primary obligor in the same periods as the expense is incurred. We recognize the cost basis of non-normal tenant improvements in accordance with U.S. GAAP (\"Non-Normal Tenant Improvements\") as real estate investments and deferred revenue. We depreciate the real estate investments over their estimated useful lives applying the straight-line method and deferred revenue is amortized applying the straight-line method as additional rental revenue over the remaining term of the Master Lease  once the related real estate assets are placed in service.\nOperating Expenses\nDepreciation.\nDepreciation expense for the year ended December 31, 2016 was\n$220.7 million\n, which includes depreciation expense of the Predecessor through April 24, 2016 of\n$63.7 million\n. Depreciation expense for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014 was\n$196.8 million\nand\n$186.3 million\n, respectively, which solely relates to the depreciation expense of the Predecessor. Depreciation expense increased primarily due to depreciation recognized on property improvements during the year as well as accelerated depreciation recognized on assets disposed of during the year.\nProperty transactions, net.\nProperty transactions, net for the year ended December 31, 2016 were\n$4.7 million\n, compared to\n$6.7 million\nfor the year ended December 31, 2015, and relate to normal losses on the disposition of assets recognized during the year. The Predecessor did not have any property transactions, net for the year ended December 31, 2014.\nProperty taxes.\nProperty tax expense for the year ended December 31, 2016 was\n$65.1 million\n, compared to\n$48.1 million\nand\n$48.3 million\nfor the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively. This increase was due to higher property tax assessments and the addition of the real estate assets of Borgata during the year ended December 31, 2016.\nProperty insurance.\nProperty insurance expense for the year ended December 31, 2016 was\n$2.9 million\n, compared to\n$10.4 million\nand\n$11.6 million\nfor the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively. Property insurance expense decreased in the current year because MGP and the Operating Partnership do not recognize property insurance expense following the IPO Date due to such costs being direct costs of the Tenant and not an obligation of MGP or the Operating Partnership.\nAcquisition-related expenses.\nAcquisition-related expenses for the year ended December 31, 2016 were\n$10.2 million\n, which were expenses incurred in connection with the Borgata Transaction, including real estate transfer taxes of $6.8 million and titles fees of $2.1 million. The Predecessor did not have any acquisition-related expenses for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014.\nGeneral and administrative expenses.\nGeneral and administrative expenses for the year ended December 31, 2016 were\n$9.9 million\n, which primarily relates to compensation costs, including share-based compensation expense. For the year ended December 31, 2016, we incurred $1.5 million of certain costs relating to payroll and relocation costs. The Predecessor did not have any general and administrative expense for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014.\nNon-Operating Expenses\nTotal non-operating expenses for the year ended December 31, 2016 were $116.2 million, primarily related to interest expense on our senior secured credit facility and senior notes, which included amortization of debt issuance costs of\n$7.2 million\n. There were no non-operating expenses for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014.\n33\nSupplemental Data: Results of Operations Subsequent to the Formation Transactions\nThe following table summarizes the combined and consolidated results of operations of the Operating Partnership for the year ended December 31, 2016.\nYear Ended\nLess: Activity\nIPO Date to\nDecember 31, 2016\nprior to IPO Date\nDecember 31, 2016\n(in thousands, except unit and per unit amounts)\nRevenues\nRental revenue\n$419,239\n$\u2014\n$419,239\nTenant reimbursements and other\n48,309\n\u2014\n48,309\n467,548\n\u2014\n467,548\nExpenses\nDepreciation\n220,667\n63,675\n156,992\nProperty transactions, net\n4,684\n874\n3,810\nProperty taxes\n65,120\n16,891\n48,229\nProperty insurance\n2,943\n2,943\n\u2014\nAmortization of above market lease, net\n286\n\u2014\n286\nAcquisition-related expenses\n10,178\n\u2014\n10,178\nGeneral and administrative\n9,896\n\u2014\n9,896\n313,774\n84,383\n229,391\nOperating income (loss)\n153,774\n(84,383\n)\n238,157\nNon-operating income (expense)\nInterest income\n774\n\u2014\n774\nInterest expense\n(116,212\n)\n\u2014\n(116,212\n)\nOther non-operating\n(726\n)\n\u2014\n(726\n)\n(116,164\n)\n\u2014\n(116,164\n)\nIncome (loss) before income taxes\n37,610\n(84,383\n)\n121,993\nProvision for income taxes\n(2,264\n)\n\u2014\n(2,264\n)\nNet income (loss)\n35,346\n(84,383\n)\n119,729\nLess: Net (income) loss attributable to noncontrolling interest\n$(5,408\n)\n$84,383\n$(89,791\n)\nNet income attributable to Class A shareholders\n$29,938\n$\u2014\n$29,938\nReconciliation of Non-GAAP Financial Measures\nNet income (loss)\n$35,346\n$(84,383\n)\n$119,729\nDepreciation\n220,667\n63,675\n156,992\nProperty transactions, net\n4,684\n874\n3,810\nFunds From Operations\n260,697\n(19,834\n)\n280,531\nAmortization of financing costs\n7,195\n\u2014\n7,195\nNon-cash compensation expense\n510\n\u2014\n510\nNet effect of straight-line rent and deferred revenue amortization\n(1,819\n)\n\u2014\n(1,819\n)\nAcquisition-related expenses\n10,178\n\u2014\n10,178\nAmortization of above market lease, net\n286\n\u2014\n286\nProvision for income taxes\n2,264\n\u2014\n2,264\nAdjusted Funds From Operations\n279,311\n(19,834\n)\n299,145\nInterest income\n(774\n)\n\u2014\n(774\n)\nInterest expense\n116,212\n\u2014\n116,212\nAmortization of financing costs\n(7,195\n)\n\u2014\n(7,195\n)\nAdjusted EBITDA\n$387,554\n$(19,834\n)\n$407,388\nWeighted average Operating Partnership units outstanding\nBasic\n232,181,070\nDiluted\n232,430,401\nFFO per Operating Partnership unit\nDiluted\n$1.21\nAFFO per Operating Partnership unit\nDiluted\n$1.29\n34\nNon-GAAP Measures\nFunds From Operations (\u201cFFO\u201d) is net income (computed in accordance with U.S. GAAP), excluding gains and losses from sales or disposals of property (presented as property transactions, net), plus real estate depreciation, as defined by the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts.\nAdjusted Funds From Operations (\u201cAFFO\u201d) is FFO as adjusted for amortization of financing costs, the net amortization of the above market lease, non-cash compensation expense, acquisition-related expenses, provision for income taxes, the net effect of straight-line rents and deferred revenue amortization.\nAdjusted EBITDA is net income (computed in accordance with U.S. GAAP) as adjusted for gains and losses from sales or disposals of property (presented as property transactions, net), real estate depreciation, interest income, interest expense, the net amortization of the above market lease, non-cash compensation expense, acquisition-related expenses, provision for income taxes and the net effect of straight-line rents and deferred revenue amortization.\nFFO, FFO per unit, AFFO, AFFO per unit and Adjusted EBITDA are supplemental performance measures that have not been prepared in conformity with U.S. GAAP that management believes are useful to investors in comparing operating and financial results between periods. Management believes that this is especially true since these measures exclude real estate depreciation and amortization expense and management believes that real estate values fluctuate based on market conditions rather than depreciating in value ratably on a straight-line basis over time. The Company believes such a presentation also provides investors with a meaningful measure of the Company\u2019s operating results in comparison to the operating results of other REITs. Adjusted EBITDA is useful to investors to further supplement AFFO and FFO and to provide investors a performance metric which excludes interest expense. In addition to non-cash items, beginning with the third quarter of 2016, the Company revised its calculations of AFFO and Adjusted EBITDA for acquisition-related expenses. While we do not label these expenses as non-recurring, infrequent or unusual, management believes that it is helpful to adjust for these expenses when they do occur to allow for comparability of results between periods because each acquisition is (and will be) of varying size and complexity and may involve different types of expenses depending on the type of property being acquired and from whom. This revision to such calculations had no significant impact on our AFFO and Adjusted EBITDA as reported in prior periods.\nFFO, FFO per unit, AFFO, AFFO per unit and Adjusted EBITDA do not represent cash flow from operations as defined by U.S. GAAP, should not be considered as an alternative to net income as defined by U.S. GAAP and are not indicative of cash available to fund all cash flow needs. Investors are also cautioned that FFO, FFO per unit, AFFO, AFFO per unit and Adjusted EBITDA as presented, may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other REITs due to the fact that not all real estate companies use the same definitions.\n35\nThe following table presents a reconciliation of net income (loss) to FFO, AFFO and Adjusted EBITDA.\nYear Ended\nDecember 31,\n2016\n2015\nNet income (loss)\n$35,346\n$(261,954\n)\nDepreciation\n220,667\n196,816\nProperty transactions, net\n4,684\n6,665\nFunds From Operations\n260,697\n(58,473\n)\nAmortization of financing costs\n7,195\n\u2014\nNon-cash compensation expense\n510\n\u2014\nNet effect of straight-line rent and deferred revenue amortization\n(1,819\n)\n\u2014\nAcquisition-related expenses\n10,178\n\u2014\nAmortization of above market lease, net\n286\n\u2014\nProvision for income taxes\n2,264\n\u2014\nAdjusted Funds From Operations\n279,311\n(58,473\n)\nInterest income\n(774\n)\n\u2014\nInterest expense\n116,212\n\u2014\nAmortization of financing costs\n(7,195\n)\n\u2014\nAdjusted EBITDA\n$387,554\n$(58,473\n)\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nProperty rental revenue is our primary source of cash from operations and is dependent on the Tenant\u2019s ability to pay rent.  All of our indebtedness is held by the Operating Partnership and MGP does not guarantee any of the Operating Partnership's indebtedness. MGP's principal funding requirement is the payment of distributions on its Class A shares, and its principal source of funding for these distributions is the distributions it receives from the Operating Partnership. MGP's liquidity is therefore dependent upon the Operating Partnership's ability to make sufficient distributions to it. The Operating Partnership's primary uses of cash include payment of operating expenses, debt service and distributions to us. We believe that the Operating Partnership currently has sufficient liquidity to satisfy all of its commitments, including its distributions to MGP, and in turn, that we currently have sufficient liquidity to satisfy all our commitments in the form of\n$360.5 million\nin cash and cash equivalents held by the Operating Partnership as of December 31, 2016, expected cash flows from operations, and\n$600.0 million\nof borrowing capacity under the Operating Partnership's revolving credit facility as of December 31, 2016.\nSummary of Cash Flows\nNet cash provided by operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2016 was\n$297.8 million\n, which includes cash inflows from rental revenues under the Master Lease and outflows for general and administrative expenses and acquisition-related expenses as well as interest payments. During the year ended December 31, 2016, operating outflows included $19.8 million related to activities of the Predecessor prior to the IPO Date funded by MGM. Net cash used in operating activities for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014 were\n$58.5 million\nand\n$60.0 million\n, respectively, which were attributable to the operating expenses of the Predecessor.\nNet cash used in investing activities for the year ended December 31, 2016 was\n$139.0 million\n, which was attributable to capital expenditures, compared to cash used in investing activities of\n$129.3 million\nand\n$90.5 million\nduring the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively. Such amounts were funded by MGM and relate to the activity of the Predecessor prior to the IPO Date.\nNet cash provided by financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2016 was\n$201.7 million\n, which was primarily attributable to net proceeds of $3.6 billion from the issuance of indebtedness by the Operating Partnership and net proceeds of $1.1 billion received from the issuance of Class A shares, partially offset by the $4.5 billion repayment of the bridge facilities that were assumed by the Operating Partnership in connection with the Formation Transactions and the Borgata Transaction. Net cash provided by financing activities for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014 was\n$187.8 million\nand\n$150.5 million\n, respectively, which represent the net amounts transferred from MGM related to the Predecessor.\n36\nDividends and Distributions\nOn June 16, 2016, the Operating Partnership announced a cash distribution to holders of Operating Partnership units of $0.2632 per unit (which amount was based on a distribution of $0.3575 per Operating Partnership unit for a full quarter). MGP\u2019s Board of Directors concurrently declared a pro rata cash dividend for the quarter ended June 30, 2016, of $0.2632 per Class A share (which amount was based on a dividend of $0.3575 per Class A share for a full quarter) payable to shareholders of record as of June 30, 2016. The distribution and dividend were paid on July 15, 2016.\nOn September 15, 2016, the Operating Partnership announced a distribution to holders of Operating Partnership units of $0.3875 per unit. MGP\u2019s Board of Directors concurrently declared a cash dividend for the quarter ended September 30, 2016 of $0.3875 per Class A share payable to shareholders of record as of September 30, 2016. The distribution and dividend were paid on October 14, 2016.\nOn December 15, 2016, the Operating Partnership announced a distribution to holders of Operating Partnership units of $0.3875 per unit. MGP\u2019s Board of Directors concurrently declared a quarterly dividend of $0.3875 per Class A share (which amount was based on a dividend of $1.55 per Class A share for a full year). The distribution and dividend were paid on January 16, 2017 to holders of record on December 30, 2016.\nIn the future, MGP expects to pay quarterly dividends in cash of approximately $22.3 million equal to $0.3875 per share (or $89.1 million on an annualized basis equal to $1.55 per share) to its Class A shareholders, which amount may be changed in the future at the discretion of MGP's Board of Directors.\nPrincipal Debt Arrangements\nAs of December 31, 2016, we had\n$3.7 billion\nprincipal amount of indebtedness in the form of the Operating Partnership's (i)senior secured credit facilities and (ii) $1.05 billion principal amount of 5.625% senior notes due 2024 and $500 million principal amount of 4.50% senior notes due 2026 (collectively, the \u201csenior notes\u201d). The Operating Partnership\u2019s senior secured credit facilities include a\n$292.5 million\nterm loan A facility which matures in 2021, a\n$1.84 billion\nterm loan B facility which matures in 2023 and a\n$600.0 million\nrevolving credit facility which also matures in 2021. No amounts were drawn under the revolving credit facility as of December 31, 2016.\nOn October 26, 2016, the Operating Partnership completed a re-pricing of its term loan B facility. As a result of the re-pricing, the term loan B facility will bear interest at LIBOR plus 2.75%, with a LIBOR floor of 0.75%. In February 2017, MGP's corporate family rating was upgraded which resulted in the Operating Partnership receiving a further reduction in pricing to LIBOR plus\n2.50%\n, with a LIBOR floor of\n0.75%\n. All other principal provisions of the Company\u2019s existing credit facility remained unchanged.\nThe Operating Partnership's senior secured credit facility contains customary representations and warranties, events of default, and positive and negative covenants, and, with respect to the revolving credit facility and the term loan A facility, financial covenants. As of December 31, 2016, the Operating Partnership was required to have a senior secured net debt to adjusted total assets ratio of not more than 0.40 to 1.00, a total net debt to adjusted total assets ratio of not more than 0.65 to 1.00, and an interest coverage ratio of not less than 2.00 to 1.00. The Operating Partnership was in compliance with its credit agreement covenants at December 31, 2016. The indentures governing the senior notes contain certain customary affirmative and negative covenants and events of default.\nCapital Expenditures\nWe may agree, at MGM\u2019s request, to fund the cost of certain capital improvements at arm\u2019s-length terms and conditions, which may include an agreed upon increase in rent under the Master Lease. Otherwise, except as described below in connection with a deconsolidation event, capital expenditures for the properties leased under the Master Lease are the responsibility of the Tenant. The Master Lease requires the Tenant to spend an aggregate amount of at least 1% of actual adjusted net revenues from the properties per calendar year on capital expenditures.\nAlthough the Tenant is responsible for all capital expenditures during the term of the Master Lease, if, in the future, a deconsolidation event occurs, we will be required to pay the Tenant, should the Tenant so elect, for all Non-Normal Tenant Improvements, and subject to an initial cap of $100 million in the first year of the Master Lease increasing on a cumulative basis by $75 million on the first day of each lease year thereafter. Examples of Non-Normal Tenant Improvements include the costs of structural elements at the properties, including capital improvements that expand the footprint or square footage of any of the properties or extend the useful life of the properties. In addition, equipment that would be a necessary improvement at any of the properties, including elevators, air conditioning systems, or electrical wiring that are integral to such property would qualify as a Non-Normal Tenant Improvement.  Non-Normal Tenant Improvements were\n$72.4 million\nas of\nDecember 31, 2016.\nExcept as described in the two preceding paragraphs, the Tenant is required to pay for all maintenance expenditures and capital improvements. The Landlord is entitled to receive additional rent based on the 10-year Treasury yield plus 600 basis points multiplied\n37\nby the value of the new capital improvements the Landlord is required to pay for in connection with a deconsolidation event, and such capital improvements will be subject to the terms of the Master Lease.\nInflation\nThe Master Lease provides for certain increases in rent as a result of the fixed annual rent escalator or changes in the variable percentage rent as further described above under \u201c\u2014Master Lease.\u201d We expect that inflation will cause the variable percentage rent provisions to result in rent increases over time. However, we could be negatively affected if increases in rent are not sufficient to cover increases in our operating expenses due to inflation. In addition, inflation and increased cost may have an adverse impact on our tenants if increases in their operating expenses exceed increases in revenue due to inflation.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nAs of December 31, 2016 and as of the date this report was filed, we do not have any off-balance sheet arrangements.\nCommitments and Contractual Obligations\nThe following table summarizes our scheduled contractual obligations as of December 31, 2016.\nPayments due by Period\n2017\n2018\n2019\n2020\n2021\nThereafter\nTotal\nLong-term debt\n$41.9\n$33.5\n$33.5\n$33.5\n$247.3\n$3,293.6\n$3,683.3\nEstimated interest payments on long-term debt\n(1)\n164.1\n162.9\n161.8\n160.6\n151.1\n341.5\n1,142.0\nGround leases\n(2)\n6.4\n6.7\n6.7\n7.0\n7.0\n703.5\n737.3\nTotal\n$212.4\n$203.1\n$202.0\n$201.1\n$405.4\n$4,338.6\n$5,562.6\n(1)\nEstimated interest payments are based on principal amounts and expected maturities of debt outstanding at December 31, 2016 and LIBOR rates as of December 31, 2016 for our senior credit facility. We have adjusted estimated interest expense to include the impact of our interest rate swap agreements with a $500 million notional amount that were entered into in December 2016, for which we pay a fixed rate of 1.825% and receive the 1-month LIBOR rate.\n(2)\nCommitments under ground leases extending through 2070 assigned to the Company in the Borgata Transaction as discussed in Note 3 to the accompanying financial statements. Such amounts will be paid by the Tenant pursuant to the Master Lease through 2046.\nApplication of Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nOur financial statements are prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. We have identified certain accounting policies that we believe are the most critical to the presentation of our financial information over a period of time. These accounting policies may require our management to make decisions on subjective and\/or complex matters relating to reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue, costs, expenses and related disclosures. These would further lead us to estimate the effect of matters that may inherently be uncertain.\nEstimates are required in order to prepare the financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP. Significant estimates, judgments, and assumptions are required in a number of areas, including, but not limited to, determining the useful lives of real estate properties and evaluating the impairment of long-lived assets, valuation of derivative financial instruments and allocation of income taxes. The judgment on such estimates and underlying assumptions is based on our experience and various other factors that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances. These form the basis of our judgment on matters that may not be apparent from other available sources of information. In many instances changes in the accounting estimates are likely to occur from period to period. Actual results may differ from the estimates. The future financial statement presentation, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows may be affected to the extent that the actual results differ materially from our estimates.\nIncome Taxes - REIT Qualification\nWe will elect to be taxed and we believe we will qualify as a REIT for U.S. federal income tax purposes commencing with our taxable year ended December 31, 2016, and we intend to continue to be organized and to operate in a manner that will permit us to qualify as a REIT. To qualify as a REIT, we must meet certain organizational and operational requirements, including a requirement to distribute at least 90% of our annual REIT taxable income to shareholders, determined without regard to the dividends paid deduction and excluding\n38\nany net capital gains. As a REIT, we generally will not be subject to federal income tax on income that we pay as distributions to our shareholders. If we fail to qualify as a REIT in any taxable year, we will for that year and subsequent years be subject to U.S. federal and state income tax, including any applicable alternative minimum tax, on our taxable income at regular corporate income tax rates, and distributions paid to our shareholders would not be deductible by us in computing taxable income. Any resulting corporate liability could be substantial and could materially and adversely affect our net income and net cash available for distribution to shareholders. Unless we were entitled to relief under certain Code provisions, we also would be disqualified from re-electing to be taxed as a REIT for the four taxable years following the year in which we failed to qualify to be taxed as a REIT.\nReal Estate Investments\nReal estate costs related to the acquisition and improvement of our properties are capitalized and include expenditures that materially extend the useful lives of existing assets. We consider the period of future benefit of an asset to determine its appropriate useful life. Depreciation on our buildings, improvements and integral equipment is computed using the straight-line method over an estimated useful life of 3 to 40 years. If we use a shorter or longer estimated useful life, it could have a material impact on our results of operations. We believe that 3 to 40 years is an appropriate estimate of useful life.\nImpairment of Real Estate Investments\nWe continually monitor events and changes in circumstances that could indicate that the carrying amount of our real estate investments may not be recoverable or realized. In accordance with accounting standards governing the impairment or disposal of long-lived assets, the carrying value of long-lived assets, including land, buildings and improvements, land improvements, and equipment is evaluated whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that a potential impairment has occurred relative to a given asset or assets. Factors that could result in an impairment review include, but are not limited to, a current period cash flow loss combined with a history of cash flow losses, current cash flows that may be insufficient to recover the investment in a property over its remaining useful life, a projection that demonstrates continuing losses associated with the use of a long-lived asset, significant changes in the manner of use of the assets, or significant changes in business strategies. If such circumstances arise, we use an estimate of the undiscounted value of expected future operating cash flows to determine whether the long-lived assets are impaired. If the aggregate undiscounted cash flows plus net proceeds expected from disposition of the asset (if any) are less than the carrying amount of the assets, the resulting impairment charge to be recorded is calculated based on the excess of the carrying value of the assets over the fair value of such assets, with the fair value determined based on an estimate of discounted future cash flows, appraisals or other valuation techniques.\nMarket Risk\nOur primary market risk exposure is interest rate risk with respect to our existing variable-rate long-term indebtedness. As of December 31, 2016, we have incurred indebtedness in principal amount of\n$3.7 billion\n. An increase in interest rates could make the financing of any acquisition by us more costly as well as increase the costs of our variable rate debt obligations. Rising interest rates could also limit our ability to refinance our debt when it matures or cause us to pay higher interest rates upon refinancing and increase interest expense on refinanced indebtedness.\nOn October 26, 2016, the Operating Partnership completed a re-pricing of its\n$1.84 billion\nterm loan B facility. As a result of the re-pricing, the term loan B facility initially bears interest at LIBOR plus 2.75%, with a LIBOR floor of 0.75%. To manage our exposure to changes in LIBOR rates, on December 6, 2016, we entered into five-year interest rate swap agreements with a total $500 million notional amount to pay a fixed rate of 1.825% and receive the 1-month LIBOR rate in order to reduce the interest rate risk. On January 26, 2017, we entered into additional interest rate swap agreements through November 2021 with a total $700 million notional amount to pay a fixed rate of 1.964% and receive the 1-month LIBOR rate in order to reduce the interest rate risk. We also expect to manage our exposure to interest rate risk by maintaining a mix of fixed and variable rates for our indebtedness.\n39\nWe do not hold or issue financial instruments for trading purposes and do not enter into derivative transactions that would be considered speculative positions. As of December 31, 2016, long-term variable rate borrowings represented approximately 44.3% of our total borrowings. Assuming a 100 basis-point increase in LIBOR-in the case of term loan B facility (over the 0.75% floor specified in our senior secured credit facility), our annual interest cost would increase by approximately $16 million based on gross amounts outstanding at December 31, 2016. The following table provides information about the maturities of our long-term debt subject to changes in interest rates. Average interest rates presented relate to the interest rate of the debt maturity in the period.\nFair Value\nDebt maturing in\nDecember 31,\n2017\n2018\n2019\n2020\n2021\nThereafter\nTotal\n2016\nFixed-rate\n$\u2014\n$\u2014\n$\u2014\n$\u2014\n$\u2014\n$1,550.0\n$1,550.0\n$1,585.0\nAverage interest rate\n5.262%\n5.262%\nVariable rate\n$41.9\n$33.5\n$33.5\n$33.5\n$247.3\n$1,743.6\n$2,133.3\n$2,155.5\nAverage interest rate\n3.509%\n3.509%\n3.509%\n3.509%\n3.520%\n3.500%\n3.503%","91":"ITEM 7.

We are a vertically integrated operation focused on developing grades of DRAGONITE and AMIRON that can be utilized for both traditional and advanced end-market applications. We have mineral production capacity of up to approximately 55,000 tons per year. See \u201cITEM 1. BUSINESS\u201d for further details regarding both our business strategy.\nCRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES\nThe following accounting policies have been identified by management as policies critical to the Company\u2019s financial reporting.\nFair Value\nASC Topic 820,\nFair Value Measurement and Disclosures\n, defines fair value as the exchange price that would be received for an asset or paid to transfer a liability (an exit price) in the principal or most advantageous market for the asset or liability in an orderly transaction between market participants on the measurement date. This topic also establishes a fair value hierarchy, which requires classification based on observable and unobservable inputs when measuring fair value. The fair value hierarchy distinguishes between assumptions based on market data (observable inputs) and an entity\u2019s own assumptions (unobservable inputs). The hierarchy consists of three levels.\n\u25cf\nLevel 1 \u2013 quoted prices in active markets for identical assets and liabilities\n\u25cf\nLevel 2 \u2013 observable inputs other than quoted prices in active markets for identical assets and liabilities\n\u25cf\nLevel 3 \u2013significant unobservable inputs\nThe recorded value of certain financial assets and liabilities, which consist primarily of cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable, other current assets, and accounts payable and accrued expenses approximate the fair value at December 31, 2016 and 2015 based upon the short-term nature of the assets and liabilities. Based on borrowing rates currently available to the Company for loans with similar terms, and the remaining short term period outstanding, the carrying value of notes payable other than the PIK Notes, materially approximate their fair value. The fair value of the PIK Notes payable was estimated using a Monte Carlo Model.\nImpairment of Long-Lived Assets\nLong-lived assets are tested for recoverability whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that its carrying amount may not be recoverable. When such events occur, the Company compares the sum of the undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use and eventual disposition of the asset to its carrying amount. If this comparison indicates that there is impairment, the amount of the impairment is typically calculated using discounted expected future cash flows where observable fair values are not readily determinable.\nRECENT ISSUED ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS\nIn May 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (\u201cFASB\u201d) issued guidance on revenue recognition, which provides a single, comprehensive revenue recognition model for all contracts with customers and supersedes most existing revenue recognition guidance.  The main principle under this guidance is that an entity should recognize revenue at the amount it expects to be entitled to in exchange for the transfer of goods or services to customers.  The Company has identified the predominant changes to its accounting policies resulting from the application of this guidance and is in the process of quantifying the impact on its consolidated financial statements.  The cumulative effect of the initial adoption will be reflected as an adjustment to the opening balance of retained earnings as of the date of the application of the guidance; however, the Company does not expect this guidance to have a significant impact on the Company\u2019s consolidated financial statements on an annual basis.  This guidance is effective for interim and annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017, with early adoption permitted.\nIn August 2014, the FASB issued ASU No. 2014-15, \u201cPresentation of Financial Statements \u2013 Going Concern (Subtopic 205-10): Disclosure of Uncertainties about an Entity\u2019s Ability to Continue as a Going Concern\u201d (\u201cASU 2014-15\u201d) ASU 2014-15 is intended to define management\u2019s responsibility to evaluate whether there is substantial doubt about an entity\u2019s ability to continue as a going concern and to provide related footnote disclosures. Specifically, ASU 2014-15 provides a definition of the term substantial doubt and requires an assessment for a period of one year after the date the financial statements are issued. It also requires certain disclosures when substantial doubt is alleviated as a result of consideration of management\u2019s plans and requires an express statement and other disclosures when substantial doubt is not alleviated. The new standard will be effective for reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2016 with early adoption permitted. The Company adopted this guidance in 2016 (see Note 2).\nIn November 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-17, \u201cIncome Taxes\u201d, which requires that deferred tax liabilities and assets be classified as non-current in a classified statement of financial position. The amendments in this ASU apply to all entities that present a classified statement of financial position. The current requirement that deferred tax liabilities and assets of a tax-paying component of an entity be offset and presented as a single amount is not affected by the amendments. For public business entities, the amendments are effective for financial statements issued for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2016, and interim periods within those annual periods. Earlier application is permitted for all entities as of the beginning of an interim or annual reporting period. The amendments may be applied either prospectively to all deferred tax liabilities and assets or retrospectively to all periods presented. If an entity applies the guidance prospectively, the entity should disclose in the first interim and first annual period of change the nature of and reason for the change in accounting principle and a statement that prior periods were not retrospectively adjusted. If an entity applies the guidance retrospectively, the entity should disclose in the first interim and first annual period of change the nature of and reason for the change in accounting principle and quantitative information about the effects of the accounting change on prior periods.\n17\nTable of Contents\nIf an entity applies the guidance retrospectively, the entity should disclose in the first interim and first annual period of change the nature of and reason for the change in accounting principle and quantitative information about the effects of the accounting change on prior periods.\nIn February 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-02 (\u201cTopic 842\u201d) new accounting guidance for leases, which supersedes previous lease guidance. Under this guidance, for all leases with terms in excess of one year, including operating leases, the Company will be required to recognize on its balance sheet a lease liability and a right-of-use asset representing its right to use the underlying asset for the lease term. The new guidance retains a distinction between finance leases and operating leases and the classification criteria is substantially similar to previous guidance. Additionally, the recognition, measurement, and presentation of expenses and cash flows arising from a lease by a lessee have not significantly changed. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of this guidance on its consolidated financial statements. This guidance is effective for interim and annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2018, with early adoption permitted.\nIn March 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-09, \u201cImprovements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting\u201d, which simplifies several aspects of the accounting for employee share-based payment transactions. Under this amended guidance, all excess tax benefits and tax deficiencies will be recognized as income tax expense or benefit in the income statement in the period in which the awards vest or are exercised. In the statement of cash flows, excess tax benefits will be classified with other income tax cash flows in operating activities. The amended guidance also gives the option to make a policy election to account for forfeitures as they occur and increases the threshold for awards that are partially settled in cash to qualify for equity classification. This guidance is effective for interim and annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2016, with early adoption permitted.\nIn June 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-13, \u201cFinancial Instruments-Credit Losses (Topic 326): Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments,\u201d which (i) significantly changes the impairment model for most financial assets that are measured at amortized cost and certain other instruments from an incurred loss model to an expected loss model; and (ii) provides for recording credit losses on available-for-sale (AFS) debt securities through an allowance account. The update also requires certain incremental disclosures. The amendments in this ASU are effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2020, including interim periods within those fiscal years. The Company is currently evaluating the effect this ASU will have on its consolidated financial statements and disclosures.\nIn August 2016, FASB issued ASU 2016-15, \u201cClassification of Certain Cash Receipts and Cash Payments,\u201d amended guidance which clarifies how certain cash receipts and cash payments should be presented and classified in the statement of cash flows. The new guidance is intended to reduce the existing diversity in practice in how certain transactions are classified in the statement of cash flows. This guidance is effective for interim and annual periods beginning after December 15, 2017, with early adoption permitted.\nIn January 2017, the FASB issued ASU 2017-01, \u201cBusiness Combinations: Clarifying the Definition of a Business,\u201d which clarifies the definition of a business and assists entities with evaluating whether transactions should be accounted for as acquisitions (or disposals) of assets or businesses. Under this guidance, when substantially all of the fair value of gross assets acquired is concentrated in a single asset (or group of similar assets), the assets acquired would not represent a business. In addition, in order to be considered a business, an acquisition would have to include at a minimum an input and a substantive process that together significantly contribute to the ability to create an output. The amended guidance also narrows the definition of outputs by more closely aligning it with how outputs are described in FASB guidance for revenue recognition. This guidance is effective for interim and annual periods beginning after December 15, 2017, with early adoption permitted.\n18\nTable of Contents\nResults of Operations -\n2016\nCompared to\n2015\nThe following sets forth, for the periods indicated, certain components of our financial operations, including such data stated as percentage of revenues.\nTwelve Months Ended December 31,\nVariance\n2016% of Rev.\n2015% of Rev.\nAmount%\nREVENUES\n$4,013,134\n100%\n$507,474\n100%\n$3,505,660\n691%\nOPERATING EXPENSES.\nProduction costs\n2,282,805\n57%\n257,654\n51%\n2,025,151\n786%\nExploration costs\n981,045\n24%\n3,997,039\n788%\n(3,015,944\n)\n(75%)\nGeneral and administrative *\n4,069,508\n*\n101%\n4,857,015\n*\n957%\n(787,507\n)\n(16%)\nDepreciation expense\n1,348,860\n34%\n1,312,585\n259%\n36,275\n3%\n(Gain) from disposition of land\n(108,764\n)\n(3%)\n0\n0%\n108,764\n)\n0%\nTotal Operating Expenses\n8,573,454\n214%\n10,424,293\n2,054%\n(1,850,839\n)\n(18%)\nOperating Loss\n(4,560,320\n)\n(114%)\n(9,916,819\n)\n(1,954%)\n5,356,499\n(54%)\nOTHER INCOME (EXPENSE).\nInterest expense, net, including amortization of deferred financing cost and debt discount\n(6,308,495\n)\n(157%)\n(4,567,952\n)\n(900%)\n(1,740,543\n)\n38%\nGain on revaluation of PIK Notes\n3,229,043\n80%\n5,328,515\n1,050%\n(2,099,472\n)\n(39%)\nOther (expense)\n0\n0%\n(648,892\n)\n(128%)\n648,892\n(100%)\nTotal Other Income (Expense)\n(3,079,452\n)\n(77%)\n111,671\n22%\n(3,191,123\n)\n(2,858%)\nNet Loss\n$(7,639,772\n)\n(190%)\n$(9,805,148\n)\n(1,932%)\n$2,165,376\n(22%)\n* Includes $476,493 and $397,417 of noncash stock compensation expense for 2015 and 2014, respectively, relating to employee and consultant stock options.\nRevenue generated during 2016 was $4,013,134, compared to $507,474 of revenue generated during the same period in 2015, an increase of 691.0%. DRAGONITE sales in 2016 were $462,988 and AMIRON sales were $3,550,144. DRAGONITE sales increased by $324,190, or 233.4%, when compared to 2015. This increase resulted primarily from an increase in sales to customers utilizing DRAGONITE in commercial applications that include catalysts, nucleating agents, polymer filler and ceramics. AMIRON sales increased by $3,364,292, or 1,844.6%, due primarily to the inclusion of a full year of the Company\u2019s take-or-pay supply agreement for its AMIRON iron oxide product. This agreement began in December, 2015.\nTotal operating expenses for 2016 were $8,573,454 compared to $10,424,282 of expenses incurred during the same period in 2015, a decrease of $1,850,828 or 18.0%. The 18.0% decline in operating expenses was primarily due to an 82.0% decline in exploration costs and a 16.0% decline in general and administrative expenses, offset by a 786.0% increase in production expenses and a 3.0% increase in depreciation expense.\nProduction costs include those operating expenses which management believes are directly related to the mining and processing of the Company\u2019s iron oxide and halloysite minerals, which result in the production of its AMIRON and DRAGONITE products for commercial sale. Production costs include, but are not limited to, wages and benefits of employees who mine material and who work in the Company\u2019s milling operations, energy costs associated with the operation of the Company\u2019s two mills, the cost of mining and milling supplies and the cost of the maintenance and repair of the Company\u2019s mining and milling equipment. Wages and energy expenses are the two largest components of the Company\u2019s production costs.\nThe Company\u2019s production costs during 2016 were primarily associated with a full year of fulfillment of a 5-year, $5 million take-or-pay supply agreement into which the Company entered during December 2015. The Company\u2019s production activity from January, 2015 through November, 2015 was minimal.\n19\nTable of Contents\nExploration costs include operating expenses incurred at the Dragon Mine that are not directly related to production activities. Exploration costs, excluding depreciation expense, incurred during 2016 were $981,045 compared to $3,997,039 of costs incurred during the same period in 2015, a decrease of 75.0%. The decline in exploration costs during the period was driven, in large part, by a shift in the allocation of employees from exploration to production activities. In addition to this shift of headcount, certain of the Company\u2019s underground exploration activities were completed during 2015 and the labor and other related costs associated with these exploration activities were eliminated.\nGeneral and administrative expenses for 2016 totaled $4,069,508 compared to $4,857,000 of expense incurred during the same period in 2015, a decrease of 16%. The Company\u2019s general and administrative expenses are associated with its New York operations. The largest component of the Company\u2019s general and administrative expense includes employee compensation and expense related to the issuance of stock options to employees and consultants.\nEmployee wages during 2016 totaled $1,981,500, an increase of $12,900 when compared to employee wages incurred during 2015. Employee wage expense during 2016 included (i) $350,400 of compensation paid to employees who left the company during 2016; and (ii) a total of $112,500 in performance bonus payments paid to the Company\u2019s CFO, General Counsel and a third employee for performance goals achieved during 2015.\nExpenses incurred on professional services during 2016 totaled $168,200, a decrease of $385,100 or 70%, when compared to 2015. The decline was driven primarily by: (i) the elimination of a need of the Company to utilize outside counsel for certain legal work and (ii) the Company\u2019s decision to cease the use of a consulting firm for certain product development work.\nDirector expense incurred during 2016 was $180,900 during 2016, a decline of $253,400, or 58.4%, when compared to 2015.The decline was the result of the Company\u2019s directors\u2019 decision to take a significant portion of their fees in options to purchase shares of common stock at Blac-Scholes valuations significantly below the cash equivalent payable to them.\nShareholder expense incurred during 2016 was $96,700, a decline of $203,900, or 68.0%. The decline was driven primarily be a reduction in compensation to the firm that provides the Company investor relations. During 2016 the Company reduced the monthly fee it pays its investor relations provider and eliminated a stock grant that it paid to the firm during 2015.\nTravel and entertainment expense incurred during 2016 was $234,000, a decline of $109,500, or 31.3%, when compared to 2015. The decline was driven primarily by the Company\u2019s decision to (i) allocate its marketing resources on a more focused field of customer targets and (ii) utilize its distributors for other marketing activities.\nOperating Loss incurred during the quarter was $4,560,320, a decrease of $5,356,499 when compared to 2015. The reduction was driven primarily by a $3,505,660 increase in revenue and a decrease in Total Operating Expenses of $1,850,839.\nTotal Other Expense for 2016 was $3,079,452 compared to Total Other Income of $111,671 during the same period in 2015, a decrease of $3,191,123. The decline in Total Other Income was driven primarily by a $2,099,472, or 39.0%, decrease in the gain on the revaluation of PIK Notes derivative due to the decline in the Company\u2019s stock price over the period, a $1,740,543, or 38.0%, increase in interest expense due to an increase in the principal balance of the Series A and Series 2023 Convertible PIK Notes, partially offset by the elimination of $650,000 of other expense primarily related to a penalty the Company had to pay during 2015 related to the Series A and Series 2023 Convertible PIK Notes.,\nNet Loss for 2016 was $7,639,772, a decrease of $2,165,376 when compared to a net loss of $9,805,137 for 2015. The decrease in net loss was driven primarily by the decrease in Operating Loss of $5,356,499, partially offset by an increase in Total Other Expense of $3,191,123.\n20\nTable of Contents\nResults of Operations - 2015 Compared to 2014\nThe following sets forth, for the periods indicated, certain components of our operating earnings, including such data stated as percentage of revenues.\nTwelve Months Ended December 31,\nVariance\n2015% of Rev.\n2014% of Rev.\nAmount%\nREVENUES\n$507,474\n100%\n$234,221\n100%\n$273,253\n117%\nOPERATING EXPENSES.\nProduction costs\n257,654\n51%\n49,464\n21%\n208,190\n421%\nExploration costs\n3,997,039\n788%\n4,626,139\n1,975%\n(629,100\n)\n(14%\n)\nGeneral and administrative *\n4,857,015\n*\n957%\n5,195,830\n*\n2,218%\n(338,815\n)\n(7%\n)\nDepreciation expense\n1,312,585\n259%\n1,164,366\n497%\n148,219\n13%\nTotal Operating Expenses\n10,424,282\n2,054%\n11,035,799\n4,712%\n(611,517\n)\n(6%\n)\nOperating Loss\n(9,916,808\n)\n(1,954%\n)\n(10,801,578\n)\n(4,612%\n)\n884,770\n(8%\n)\nOTHER INCOME (EXPENSE).\nInterest expense, net, including amortization of deferred financing cost and debt discount\n(4,567,952\n)\n(900%\n)\n(1,667,285\n)\n(712%\n)\n(2,900,667\n)\n174%\nGain on revaluation of warrants derivative\n0\n0%\n830,000\n354%\n(830,000\n)\n(100%\n)\nGain on revaluation of stock awards\n0\n0%\n110,000\n47%\n(110,000\n)\n(100%\n)\nGain on revaluation of PIK Notes\n5,328,515\n1,050%\n1,470,798\n628%\n3,857,717\n262%\nOther (expense)\n(648,892\n)\n(128%\n)\n(258,252\n)\n(110%\n)\n(390,640\n)\n151%\nTotal Other Income (Expense)\n111,671\n25%\n485,261\n(207%\n)\n(373,590\n)\n(77%\n)\nNet Loss\n$(9,805,137\n)\n(1,932%\n)\n$(10,316,317\n)\n(4,405%\n)\n$511,180\n(5%\n)\n* Includes $397,417 and $865,716 of noncash stock compensation expense for 2015 and 2014, respectively, relating to employee and consultant stock options.\nRevenue generated during 2015 was $507,474, compared to $234,221 of revenue generated during the same period in 2014, an increase of 117.0%. DRAGONITE sales in 2015 were $324,085 and AMIRON sales were $183,389. DRAGONITE sales increased by approximately $117,000 (56.5%) during 2015 compared to 2014. This increase resulted primarily from a $120,000 increase in sales to customers utilizing DRAGONITE in commercial applications that include catalysts, nucleating agents for plastic and reinforcing fillers for plastics. This increase was partially offset by a decline in sales of DRAGONITE for testing and scale-up purposes. AMIRON sales increased approximately $161,000 (714.3%) compared to 2014. The increase was due to sales made to two customers who are using the material for pigment and catalyst applications.\nTotal operating expenses for 2015 were $10,424,282 compared to $11,035,799 of expenses incurred during the same period in 2014, a decrease of $611,517 or 6.0%. The components of the Company\u2019s operating expenses include exploration costs and general and administrative expenses. Exploration costs are incurred by our Dragon Mine operation. General and administrative costs primarily include expenses incurred by our New York-based operation. The 6.0% decline in operating expenses was primarily due to an 8.0% decline in exploration costs and a 7% decline in general and administrative expenses, offset by a 13% increase in depreciation expense.\nExploration costs, excluding depreciation expense, incurred during 2015 were $3,997,039 compared to $4,626,139 of costs incurred during the same period in 2014, a decrease of 14.0%. The decline was driven primarily by a $246,700, or 66.7%, decline in the use of outside labs for product development and testing, a $280,200, or 57.8%, decline in the use of geological consulting services, a $86,800, or 5.1%, decline in wage expense, a $61,100 decline in drilling materials and equipment maintenance, and a $57,200, or 24.5%, decline in utility (electricity) charges. These decreases were partially offset by a $163,500, or 328.9% increase in equipment rentals and leases, a $63,500, or 206.7%, increase in safety expense, a $61,300, or 67.1%, increase in building maintenance expense, a $34,600, or 357.6%, increase in consulting expense, and a $29,200 increase in workers\u2019 compensation related to the Dragon Mine operations.\nThe decrease in expense related to the use of outside labs for product development and testing was driven by the Company\u2019s decision to establish a lab at the Dragon Mine facility and conduct most of its product development and testing in-house. The decline in expense related to the use of geological consulting services is, in large part, due to the completion of the characterization of the Dragon Mine resource. The decline in wage expense, drilling materials costs and equipment maintenance expense were due, in large part, to the completion of certain underground development activities during the latter half of 2016. The increase in equipment rentals and leases was due to equipment needs related to pre-production of the iron oxide contract and equipment needed related to work focused on enhancing our clay processing capabilities. The increase in safety expense is related to the Company\u2019s effort to enhance its compliance with MSHA standards.\n21\nTable of Contents\nThe increase in building maintenance expense was due to work needed to enhance the reliability of the Company\u2019s larger mill facility. The increase in consulting expense is due to the hiring of surveyor to perform continued work on the Dragon Mine property. The increase in workers\u2019 compensation expense is related to a slight increase in rates.\nGeneral and administrative expenses for 2015 totaled $4,857,015 compared to $5,195,830 of expense incurred during the same period in 2014, a decrease of 6.0%. The decline was driven primarily by a $263,900, or 10.6%, decrease in payroll expense and a $468,300, or 54.1%, decrease in compensation expense, partially offset by a $152,700, or 103.2%, increase in shareholder expenses, a $137,800, or 46.5%, increase in director expense, and a $90,700, or 101.9%, increase in consulting service fees. The decline in payroll expense is the result of a decline in certain executive compensation. The decrease in equity compensation is the result of a decrease in the value of equity granted to employees. The increase in shareholder expense was due primarily to the engagement of a new investor relations firm. The increase in director expense was due to the addition of a director. The increase in consulting expense was due to the engagement of a cosmetic product development lab..\nOther income for 2015 was $111,671 compared to other income of $485,261 during the same period in 2014, a decrease of 77%. The $373,590 decline in other income was driven primarily by a $2,900,667, or 174.0%, increase in interest expense, a $3,857,717, or 262.3%, increase in the gain on the revaluation of PIK Notes derivative, and a $390,640, or 151.3%, increase in other expense. The increase in interest expense is due to the issuance of approximately $19.8 million of the 10% Convertible PIK Notes due 2018. The increase in the revaluation of PIK Notes derivative is due to a decline in the Company\u2019s stock price.\nNet Loss for 2015 was $9,805,137 compared to a net loss of $10,316,317 for 2014, a decrease of $511,180 or 5%. The improvement in net loss was driven primarily by the 117.0% increase in revenue and 5.0% decrease in operating expense.\nLIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES\nThe Company has a history of recurring losses from operations and the use of cash in operating activities while in the process of developing and commercializing halloysite clay and iron oxide. For the year ended December 31, 2016, the Company\u2019s net loss was $7,639,772 and cash used in operating activities was $2,732,089. As of December 31, 2016, the Company has negative working capital of ($15,036), which takes into account $961,395 of accrued PIK Note interest, which the Company expects to pay in-kind and $156,000 of disputed payables for which the Company believes it has a statute of limitations defense.\nManagement believes that in order for the Company to meet its obligations arising from normal business operations through March 31, 2018 that the Company requires (i) additional capital either in the form of a private placement of common stock or debt and\/or (ii) additional sales of its products that will generate sufficient operating profit and cash flows to fund operations. Without additional capital or additional sales of its products, the Company\u2019s ability to continue to operate will be limited.\nBased on the Company\u2019s current cash usage expectations through March 31, 2018, management believes it will not have sufficient liquidity to fund its operation through March 31, 2018. Further, management cannot provide any assurance that it is probable that the Company will be successful in accomplishing any of its plans to raise debt or equity financing or generate significant additional product sales. Collectively, these factors raise substantial doubt regarding the Company\u2019s ability to continue as going concern.\nCash used in operating activities in 2016 was $2,732,089 compared to $8,585,600 of cash used during the same period in 2015. Cash used in operating activities during 2016, after adjusting for non-cash items but before adjusting for changes in operating assets and liabilities, was $2,862,022, $4,889,099 less than the comparable period in 2015, driven primarily by the Company\u2019s increase in revenue and reduction of operating expenses. After adjusting for the change in operating assets and liabilities, cash used in operating activities during 2016 was $2,732,089, $5,853,468 less than during 2015.\nCash provided by investing activities during 2016 was $335,700 compared to a use of $251,500 during the same period in 2015. The increase was due primarily to the closing of the sale of certain non-core assets during 2016.\nCash provided by financing activities during 2016 was $1,643,100 compared to a use of $61,923. The increase was due primarily to proceeds generated in June, 2016 from the private placement of $1,640,000 of common stock to certain investors.\nOur total assets as of December 31, 2016 were $6,079,539 compared to $8,318,112 as of December 31, 2015, or a decrease of $2,238,573. The decrease in total assets was due primarily to a decrease in cash of $753,251 due primarily to cash used in operating activities and a decrease in property and equipment, net of $1,131,649 due primarily to the depreciation of our new mill assets, partially offset by an increase in prepaid and other long-term assets. Total liabilities were $27,047,593 at December 31, 2016 compared to $24,057,762 at December 31, 2015. The increase in total liabilities was due primarily to a $3,005,537 increase in long-term liabilities, primarily consisting of PIK Notes payable.\n22\nTable of Contents\nISSUANCE OF CONVERTIBLE DEBT\nThe Company raised $12.5 million of financing through the issuance of Paid-In-Kind (\u201cPIK\u201d)-Election Convertible Notes in 2014, with key terms highlighted in the table below.\nKey Terms\nSeries A Notes\nInception Date\n11\/03\/2014\nCash Received\n$12,500,000\nPrincipal (Initial Liability)\n$19,848,486\nMaturity (Term)\n4 years, but may range between 2 years to the full maturity of the Series 2023 Notes, depending on whether a Specified Event occurs and\/or an Extension Option is elected (see below for further details)\nExercise Price\n$0.92 at inception, adjusted downward based on anti-dilution provisions\/down-round protection; also may be reduced by $0.10 based if Extension Option is elected (see below)\nStated Interest\n10% per annum, due semiannually, may be reduced to 1% if a Specified Event occurs\nDerivative Liability\n$9,212,285 established at inception due to existence of down-round protection; revalued every quarter using a Monte Carlo model\nSeries A Notes\nOn November 3, 2014 (\u201cIssue Date\u201d), the Company issued, in a private placement pursuant to investment agreements, $19,848,486 principal amount of 10% PIK-Election Convertible Notes due 2018 (\"Series A Notes\") in exchange for $12,500,000 in cash and the cancellation of previously-issued warrants held by one investor.\nBelow are key terms of the Series A Notes.\n\u25cf\nMaturity\n- November 3, 2018, provided that the Stated Maturity Date may be extended to November 3, 2019 at the option of the Company (the \u201cExtension Option\u201d) if (i) the Company has delivered written notice of its exercise of the Extension Option to the Holder not more than ninety (90) nor less than thirty (30) days prior to November 3, 2018 and (ii) the Company has delivered a certificate, dated as of November 3, 2018, certifying that no Default or Event of Default has occurred and is continuing; provided, further that the Stated Maturity Date shall be extended to the maturity date of the Series 2023 Notes or any Replacement Financing, as applicable, upon the occurrence of a Specified Event (\u201cSpecified Extension\u201d).\n\u25cf\nExercise Price\n- initially $0.92 per share and will be (i) adjusted from time to time pursuant anti-dilution provisions and (ii) reduced by $0.10 per share if the Company elects to exercise its Extension Option.\n\u25cf\nStated Interest\n: 10% payable semiannually in arrears, provided that the interest rate shall be reduced to 1% per annum on the principal amount of the Note upon the occurrence of the Specified Event, as defined below.\n\u25cf\nSpecified Event\n- means the event that may occur after the second anniversary of the Issuer Date if: (i) any amounts under the Series 2023 Notes or any Replacement Financing are outstanding, (ii) the VWAP for the preceding 30 consecutive Trading Days as determined by the Board of Directors of the Issuer in good faith is in excess of the Exercise Price, (iii) the closing Market Price of the common stock is in excess of the Exercise Price on the date immediately preceding the date on which the Specified Event occurs, (iv) no Default or Event of Default has occurred and is continuing and (v) the Issuer has delivered a certificate to each holder of Series A Notes certifying that the conditions set forth in clauses (i) through (iv) above have been met.\n\u25cf\nExtension Option\n- If stock price is lower than current exercise price ($0.92) prior to the stated maturity (November 3, 2018), then the Company can elect an Extension Option, whereby the maturity is extended by one year (see Maturity definition), but with a reduction in exercise price by $0.10.\n\u25cf\nLiquidated Damages\n- The Company is required to pay the noteholders 1% of the principal amount of the Series A Notes if a Registration statement is not filed and effective within 90 days of the inception date (and further damages for every 30 days thereafter).

During the second quarter of 2015, the Company issued 1,015,086 shares valued at $741,011 to Series A note holders as payment of liquidated damages.\n\u25cf\nThe number of shares issuable under the Notes may be affected by the anti-dilution provisions of the Notes. The anti-dilution provisions adjust the Exercise Price of the Notes in the event of stock dividends and splits, issuance below the market price of the common stock, issuances below the conversion price of the Notes, pro rata distribution of assets, rights plans, tender offers, and exchange offers.\nOFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS\nThere are no off-balance sheet arrangements between the Company and any other entity that have, or are reasonably likely to have, a current or future effect on our financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures, or capital resources that is material to investors.\n23\nTable of Contents\nCONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS\nOffice Lease\nDuring 2016, the Company rented office space in New York, NY on a month-to-month basis at a monthly rent of approximately $16,700 per month, for an aggregate of approximately $201,000 for the year ended December 31, 2016.
